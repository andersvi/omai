The Fulton County Grand Jury said Friday an investigation of Atlanta's recent primary election produced no evidence that any irregularities took place.
The jury further said in term-end presentments that the City Executive Committee, which had over-all charge of the election, deserves the praise and thanks of the City of Atlanta for the manner in which the election was conducted.
The September-*october term jury had been charged by Fulton Superior Court Judge Durwood Pye to investigate reports of possible irregularities in the hard-fought primary which was won by Mayor-nominate Ivan Allen Jr..
Only a relative handful of such reports was received, the jury said, considering the widespread interest in the election, the number of voters and the size of this city.
The jury said it did find that many of Georgia's registration and election laws are outmoded or inadequate and often ambiguous.
It recommended that Fulton legislators act to have these laws studied and revised to the end of modernizing and improving them.
The grand jury commented on a number of other topics, among them the Atlanta and Fulton County purchasing departments which it said are well operated and follow generally accepted practices which inure to the best interest of both governments.
Merger proposed however, the jury said it believes these two offices should be combined to achieve greater efficiency and reduce the cost of administration.
The City Purchasing Department, the jury said, is lacking in experienced clerical personnel as a result of city personnel policies.
It urged that the city take steps to remedy this problem.
Implementation of Georgia's automobile title law was also recommended by the outgoing jury.
It urged that the next Legislature provide enabling funds and re-set the effective date so that an orderly implementation of the law may be effected.
The grand jury took a swipe at the State Welfare Department's handling of federal funds granted for child welfare services in foster homes.
This is one of the major items in the Fulton County general assistance program, the jury said, but the State Welfare Department has seen fit to distribute these funds through the welfare departments of all the counties in the state with the exception of Fulton County, which receives none of this money.
The jurors said they realize a proportionate distribution of these funds might disable this program in our less populous counties.
Nevertheless, we feel that in the future Fulton County should receive some portion of these available funds, the jurors said.
Failure to do this will continue to place a disproportionate burden on Fulton taxpayers.
The jury also commented on the Fulton ordinary's court which has been under fire for its practices in the appointment of appraisers, guardians and administrators and the awarding of fees and compensation.
Wards protected the jury said it found the court has incorporated into its operating procedures the recommendations of two previous grand juries, the Atlanta Bar Association and an interim citizens committee.
These actions should serve to protect in fact and in effect the court's wards from undue costs and its appointed and elected servants from unmeritorious criticisms, the jury said.
Regarding Atlanta's new multi-million-dollar airport, the jury recommended that when the new management takes charge Jan. 1 the airport be operated in a manner that will eliminate political influences.
The jury did not elaborate, but it added that there should be periodic surveillance of the pricing practices of the concessionaires for the purpose of keeping the prices reasonable.
Ask jail deputies on other matters, the jury recommended that : 1 four additional deputies be employed at the Fulton County Jail and a doctor, medical intern or extern be employed for night and weekend duty at the jail.
2 Fulton legislators work with city officials to pass enabling legislation that will permit the establishment of a fair and equitable pension plan for city employes.
The jury praised the administration and operation of the Atlanta Police Department, the Fulton Tax Commissioner's Office, the Bellwood and Alpharetta prison farms, Grady Hospital and the Fulton Health Department.
Mayor William B. Hartsfield filed suit for divorce from his wife, Pearl Williams Hartsfield, in Fulton Superior Court Friday.
His petition charged mental cruelty.
The couple was married Aug. 2, 1913.
They have a son, William Berry Jr., and a daughter, Mrs. J. M. Cheshire of Griffin.
Attorneys for the mayor said that an amicable property settlement has been agreed upon.
The petition listed the mayor's occupation as attorney and his age as 71.
It listed his wife's age as 74 and place of birth as Opelika, Ala..
The petition said that the couple has not lived together as man and wife for more than a year.
The Hartsfield home is at 637 E. Pelham Rd. *j.
Henry L. Bowden was listed on the petition as the mayor's attorney.
Hartsfield has been mayor of Atlanta, with exception of one brief interlude, since 1937.
His political career goes back to his election to city council in 1923.
The mayor's present term of office expires Jan. 1.
He will be succeeded by Ivan Allen Jr., who became a candidate in the Sept. 13 primary after Mayor Hartsfield announced that he would not run for reelection.
Georgia Republicans are getting strong encouragement to enter a candidate in the 1962 governor's race, a top official said Wednesday.
Robert Snodgrass, state *j chairman, said a meeting held Tuesday night in Blue Ridge brought enthusiastic responses from the audience.
State Party Chairman James W. Dorsey added that enthusiasm was picking up for a state rally to be held Sept. 8 in Savannah at which newly elected Texas Sen. John Tower will be the featured speaker.
In the Blue Ridge meeting, the audience was warned that entering a candidate for governor would force it to take petitions out into voting precincts to obtain the signatures of registered voters.
Despite the warning, there was a unanimous vote to enter a candidate, according to Republicans who attended.
When the crowd was asked whether it wanted to wait one more term to make the race, it voted no -- and there were no dissents.
The largest hurdle the Republicans would have to face is a state law which says that before making a first race, one of two alternative courses must be taken : 1 five per cent of the voters in each county must sign petitions requesting that the Republicans be allowed to place names of candidates on the general election ballot, or 2 the Republicans must hold a primary under the county unit system -- a system which the party opposes in its platform.
Sam Caldwell, State Highway Department public relations director, resigned Tuesday to work for Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's campaign.
Caldwell's resignation had been expected for some time.
He will be succeeded by Rob Ledford of Gainesville, who has been an assistant more than three years.
When the gubernatorial campaign starts, Caldwell is expected to become a campaign coordinator for Byrd.
The Georgia Legislature will wind up its 1961 session Monday and head for home -- where some of the highway bond money it approved will follow shortly.
Before adjournment Monday afternoon, the Senate is expected to approve a study of the number of legislators allotted to rural and urban areas to determine what adjustments should be made.
Gov. Vandiver is expected to make the traditional visit to both chambers as they work toward adjournment.
Vandiver likely will mention the $100 million highway bond issue approved earlier in the session as his first priority item.
Construction bonds meanwhile, it was learned the State Highway Department is very near being ready to issue the first $30 million worth of highway reconstruction bonds.
The bond issue will go to the state courts for a friendly test suit to test the validity of the act, and then the sales will begin and contracts let for repair work on some of Georgia's most heavily traveled highways.
A Highway Department source said there also is a plan there to issue some $3 million to $4 million worth of Rural Roads Authority bonds for rural road construction work.
A revolving fund the department apparently intends to make the Rural Roads Authority a revolving fund under which new bonds would be issued every time a portion of the old ones are paid off by tax authorities.
Vandiver opened his race for governor in 1958 with a battle in the Legislature against the issuance of $50 million worth of additional rural roads bonds proposed by then Gov. Marvin Griffin.
The Highway Department source told The Constitution, however, that Vandiver has not been consulted yet about the plans to issue the new rural roads bonds.
Schley County Rep. B. D. Pelham will offer a resolution Monday in the House to rescind the body's action of Friday in voting itself a $10 per day increase in expense allowances.
Pelham said Sunday night there was research being done on whether the quickie vote on the increase can be repealed outright or whether notice would have to first be given that reconsideration of the action would be sought.
While emphasizing that technical details were not fully worked out, Pelham said his resolution would seek to set aside the privilege resolution which the House voted through 87-31.
A similar resolution passed in the Senate by a vote of 29-5.
As of Sunday night, there was no word of a resolution being offered there to rescind the action.
Pelham pointed out that Georgia voters last November rejected a constitutional amendment to allow legislators to vote on pay raises for future Legislature sessions.
A veteran Jackson County legislator will ask the Georgia House Monday to back federal aid to education, something it has consistently opposed in the past.
Rep. Mac Barber of Commerce is asking the House in a privilege resolution to endorse increased federal support for public education, provided that such funds be received and expended as state funds.
Barber, who is in his 13th year as a legislator, said there are some members of our congressional delegation in Washington who would like to see it ( the resolution ) passed.
But he added that none of Georgia's congressmen specifically asked him to offer the resolution.
The resolution, which Barber tossed into the House hopper Friday, will be formally read Monday.
It says that in the event Congress does provide this increase in federal funds, the State Board of Education should be directed to give priority to teacher pay raises.
Colquitt -- after a long, hot controversy, Miller County has a new school superintendent, elected, as a policeman put it, in the coolest election I ever saw in this county.
The new school superintendent is Harry Davis, a veteran agriculture teacher, who defeated Felix Bush, a school principal and chairman of the Miller County Democratic Executive Committee.
Davis received 1,119 votes in Saturday's election, and Bush got 402.
Ordinary Carey Williams, armed with a pistol, stood by at the polls to insure order.
This was the coolest, calmest election I ever saw, Colquitt Policeman Tom Williams said.
Being at the polls was just like being at church.
I didn't smell a drop of liquor, and we didn't have a bit of trouble.
The campaign leading to the election was not so quiet, however.
It was marked by controversy, anonymous midnight phone calls and veiled threats of violence.
The former county school superintendent, George P. Callan, shot himself to death March 18, four days after he resigned his post in a dispute with the county school board.
During the election campaign, both candidates, Davis and Bush, reportedly received anonymous telephone calls.
Ordinary Williams said he, too, was subjected to anonymous calls soon after he scheduled the election.
Many local citizens feared that there would be irregularities at the polls, and Williams got himself a permit to carry a gun and promised an orderly election.
Sheriff Felix Tabb said the ordinary apparently made good his promise.
Everything went real smooth, the sheriff said.
There wasn't a bit of trouble.
Austin, Texas -- committee approval of Gov. Price Daniel's abandoned property act seemed certain Thursday despite the adamant protests of Texas bankers.
Daniel personally led the fight for the measure, which he had watered down considerably since its rejection by two previous Legislatures, in a public hearing before the House Committee on Revenue and Taxation.
Under committee rules, it went automatically to a subcommittee for one week.
But questions with which committee members taunted bankers appearing as witnesses left little doubt that they will recommend passage of it.
Daniel termed extremely conservative his estimate that it would produce 17 million dollars to help erase an anticipated deficit of 63 million dollars at the end of the current fiscal year next Aug. 31.
He told the committee the measure would merely provide means of enforcing the escheat law which has been on the books since Texas was a republic.
It permits the state to take over bank accounts, stocks and other personal property of persons missing for seven years or more.
The bill, which Daniel said he drafted personally, would force banks, insurance firms, pipeline companies and other corporations to report such property to the state treasurer.
The escheat law cannot be enforced now because it is almost impossible to locate such property, Daniel declared.
Dewey Lawrence, a Tyler lawyer representing the Texas Bankers Association, sounded the opposition keynote when he said it would force banks to violate their contractual obligations with depositors and undermine the confidence of bank customers.
If you destroy confidence in banks, you do something to the economy, he said.
You take out of circulation many millions of dollars.
Rep. Charles E. Hughes of Sherman, sponsor of the bill, said a failure to enact it would amount to making a gift out of the taxpayers' pockets to banks, insurance and pipeline companies.
His contention was denied by several bankers, including Scott Hudson of Sherman, Gaynor B. Jones of Houston, J. B. Brady of Harlingen and Howard Cox of Austin.
Cox argued that the bill is probably unconstitutional since, he said, it would impair contracts.
He also complained that not enough notice was given on the hearing, since the bill was introduced only last Monday.
Austin, Texas -- senators unanimously approved Thursday the bill of Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas authorizing establishment of day schools for the deaf in Dallas and the four other largest counties.
The bill is designed to provide special schooling for more deaf students in the scholastic age at a reduced cost to the state.
There was no debate as the Senate passed the bill on to the House.
It would authorize the Texas Education Agency to establish county-wide day schools for the deaf in counties of 300,000 or more population, require deaf children between 6 and 13 years of age to attend the day schools, permitting older ones to attend the residential Texas School for the Deaf here.
Operating budget for the day schools in the five counties of Dallas, Harris, Bexar, Tarrant and El Paso would be $451,500, which would be a savings of $157,460 yearly after the first year's capital outlay of $88,000 was absorbed, Parkhouse told the Senate.
The *j estimated there would be 182 scholastics to attend the day school in Dallas County, saving them from coming to Austin to live in the state deaf school.
Dallas may get to hear a debate on horse race parimutuels soon between Reps. V. E. ( Red ) Berry and Joe Ratcliff.
While details are still to be worked out, Ratcliff said he expects to tell home folks in Dallas why he thinks Berry's proposed constitutional amendment should be rejected.
We're getting more pro letters than con on horse race betting, said Ratcliff.
But I believe if people were better informed on this question, most of them would oppose it also.
I'm willing to stake my political career on it.
Rep. Berry, an ex-gambler from San Antonio, got elected on his advocacy of betting on the ponies.
A House committee which heard his local option proposal is expected to give it a favorable report, although the resolution faces hard sledding later.
The house passed finally, and sent to the Senate, a bill extending the State Health Department's authority to give planning assistance to cities.
The senate quickly whipped through its meager fare of House bills approved by committees, passing the three on the calendar.
One validated acts of school districts.
Another enlarged authority of the Beaumont Navigation District.
The third amended the enabling act for creation of the Lamar county Hospital District, for which a special constitutional amendment previously was adopted.
Without dissent, senators passed a bill by Sen. A. R. Schwartz of Galveston authorizing establishment in the future of a school for the mentally retarded in the Gulf Coast district.
Money for its construction will be sought later on but in the meantime the State Hospital board can accept gifts and donations of a site.
Two tax revision bills were passed.
One, by Sen. Louis Crump of San Saba, would aid more than 17,000 retailers who pay a group of miscellaneous excise taxes by eliminating the requirement that each return be notarized.
Instead, retailers would sign a certificate of correctness, violation of which would carry a penalty of one to five years in prison, plus a $1,000 fine.
It was one of a series of recommendations by the Texas Research League.
The other bill, by Sen. A. M. Aikin Jr. of Paris, would relieve real estate brokers, who pay their own annual licensing fee, from the $12 annual occupation license on brokers in such as stocks and bonds.
Natural gas public utility companies would be given the right of eminent domain, under a bill by Sen. Frank Owen 3 of El Paso, to acquire sites for underground storage reservoirs for gas.
Marshall Formby of Plainview, former chairman of the Texas Highway Commission, suggested a plan to fill by appointment future vacancies in the Legislature and Congress, eliminating the need for costly special elections.
Under Formby's plan, an appointee would be selected by a board composed of the governor, lieutenant governor, speaker of the House, attorney general and chief justice of the Texas Supreme Court.
Austin, Texas -- state representatives decided Thursday against taking a poll on what kind of taxes Texans would prefer to pay.
An adverse vote of 81 to 65 kept in the State Affairs Committee a bill which would order the referendum on the April 4 ballot, when Texas votes on a U.*s. senator.
Rep. Wesley Roberts of Seminole, sponsor of the poll idea, said that further delay in the committee can kill the bill.
The West Texan reported that he had finally gotten Chairman Bill Hollowell of the committee to set it for public hearing on Feb. 22.
The proposal would have to receive final legislative approval, by two-thirds majorities, before March 1 to be printed on the April 4 ballot, Roberts said.
Opponents generally argued that the ballot couldn't give enough information about tax proposals for the voters to make an intelligent choice.
All Dallas members voted with Roberts, except Rep. Bill Jones, who was absent.
Austin, Texas -- Paradise lost to the alleged water needs of Texas' big cities Thursday.
Rep. James Cotten of Weatherford insisted that a water development bill passed by the Texas House of Representatives was an effort by big cities like Dallas and Fort Worth to cover up places like Paradise, a Wise County hamlet of 250 people.
When the shouting ended, the bill passed, 114 to 4, sending it to the Senate, where a similar proposal is being sponsored by Sen. George Parkhouse of Dallas.
Most of the fire was directed by Cotten against Dallas and Sen. Parkhouse.
The bill would increase from $5,000,000 to $15,000,000 the maximum loan the state could make to a local water project.
Cotten construed this as a veiled effort by Parkhouse to help Dallas and other large cities get money which Cotten felt could better be spent providing water for rural Texas.
Statements by other legislators that Dallas is paying for all its water program by local bonds, and that less populous places would benefit most by the pending bill, did not sway Cotten's attack.
The bill's defenders were mostly small-town legislators like J. W. Buchanan of Dumas, Eligio ( Kika ) De La Garza of Mission, Sam F. Collins of Newton and Joe Chapman of Sulphur Springs.
This is a poor boy's bill, said Chapman.
Dallas and Fort Worth can vote bonds.
This would help the little peanut districts.
Austin, Texas -- a Houston teacher, now serving in the Legislature, proposed Thursday a law reducing the time spent learning educational methods.
Rep. Henry C. Grover, who teaches history in the Houston public schools, would reduce from 24 to 12 semester hours the so-called teaching methods courses required to obtain a junior or senior high school teaching certificate.
A normal year's work in college is 30 semester hours.
Grover also would require junior-senior high teachers to have at least 24 semester hours credit in the subject they are teaching.
The remainder of the 4-year college requirement would be in general subjects.
A person with a master's degree in physics, chemistry, math or English, yet who has not taken Education courses, is not permitted to teach in the public schools, said Grover.
College teachers in Texas are not required to have the Education courses.
Fifty-three of the 150 representatives immediately joined Grover as co-signers of the proposal.
Paris, Texas ( sp. ) -- the board of regents of Paris Junior College has named Dr. Clarence Charles Clark of Hays, Kan. as the school's new president.
Dr. Clark will succeed Dr. J. R. Mc*lemore, who will retire at the close of the present school term.
Dr. Clark holds an earned Doctor of Education degree from the University of Oklahoma.
He also received a Master of Science degree from Texas *j & *j College and a Bachelor of Science degree from Southwestern State College, Weatherford, Okla..
In addition, Dr. Clark has studied at Rhode Island State College and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
During his college career, Dr. Clark was captain of his basketball team and was a football letterman.
Dr. Clark has served as teacher and principal in Oklahoma high schools, as teacher and athletic director at Raymondville, Texas, High School, as an instructor at the University of Oklahoma, and as an associate professor of education at Fort Hays, Kan., State College.
He has served as a border patrolman and was in the Signal Corps of the U.*s. Army.
Denton, Texas ( sp. ) -- principals of the 13 schools in the Denton Independent School District have been re-elected for the 1961-62 session upon the recommendation of Supt. Chester O. Strickland.
State and federal legislation against racial discrimination in employment was called for yesterday in a report of a blue ribbon citizens committee on the aid to dependent children program.
The report, culminating a year long study of the *j program in Cook county by a New York City welfare consulting firm, listed 10 long range recommendations designed to reduce the soaring *j case load.
The report called racial discrimination in employment one of the most serious causes of family breakdown, desertion, and *j dependency.
Must solve problem the monthly cost of *j to more than 100,000 recipients in the county is 4.4 million dollars, said C. Virgil Martin, president of Carson Pirie Scott & Co., committee chairman.
We must solve the problems which have forced these people to depend upon *j for subsistence, Martin said.
The volume of *j cases will decrease, Martin reported, when the community is able to deal effectively with two problems : relatively limited skills and discrimination in employment because of color.
These, he said, are two of the principal underlying causes for family breakups leading to *j.
Calls for extension other recommendations made by the committee are : extension of the *j program to all children in need living with any relatives, including both parents, as a means of preserving family unity.
Research projects as soon as possible on the causes and prevention of dependency and illegitimacy.
Several defendants in the Summerdale police burglary trial made statements indicating their guilt at the time of their arrest, Judge James B. Parsons was told in Criminal court yesterday.
The disclosure by Charles Bellows, chief defense counsel, startled observers and was viewed as the prelude to a quarrel between the six attorneys representing the eight former policemen now on trial.
Bellows made the disclosure when he asked Judge Parsons to grant his client, Alan Clements, 30, a separate trial.
Bellows made the request while the all-woman jury was out of the courtroom.
Fears prejudicial aspects the statements may be highly prejudicial to my client, Bellows told the court.
Some of the defendants strongly indicated they knew they were receiving stolen property.
It is impossible to get a fair trial when some of the defendants made statements involving themselves and others.
Judge Parsons leaned over the bench and inquired, you mean some of the defendants made statements admitting this?
Yes, your honor, replied Bellows.
What this amounts to, if true, is that there will be a free-for-all fight in this case.
There is a conflict among the defendants.
Washington, July 24 -- President Kennedy today pushed aside other White House business to devote all his time and attention to working on the Berlin crisis address he will deliver tomorrow night to the American people over nationwide television and radio.
The President spent much of the week-end at his summer home on Cape Cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of White House aids in Washington with whom he talked by telephone.
Shortly after the Chief Executive returned to Washington in midmorning from Hyannis Port, Mass., a White House spokesman said the address text still had quite a way to go toward completion.
Decisions are made asked to elaborate, Pierre Salinger, White House press secretary, replied, I would say it's got to go thru several more drafts.
Salinger said the work President Kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest Berlin crisis precipitated by Russia's demands and proposals for the city.
The last 10 cases in the investigation of the Nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by Acting Judge John M. Karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence by unfair and fundamentally illegal means.
Karns said that the cases involved a matter of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence of the 50 persons.
He said evidence was obtained in violation of the legal rights of citizens.
Karns' ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases.
In the two other cases he ruled that the state had been unable to make a case.
Contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by Morris J. Wexler, special prosecutor.
Issue jury subpoenas Wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned the individuals in the Criminal courts building, but did not take them before the grand jury.
Mayer Goldberg, attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure constituted intimidation.
Wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning.
Karns said it was a wrongful act for Wexler to take statements privately and outside of the grand jury room.
He said this constituted a very serious misuse of the Criminal court processes.
Actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the Criminal court of Cook county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court, said Karns, who is a City judge in East St. Louis sitting in Cook County court.
Faced seven cases Karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons.
Wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with complementary miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another.
The cases involved judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward, and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward.
The case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by Karns.
Two other cases also were under advisement.
Claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case, Karns told Wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he would dismiss them.
Washington, Feb. 9 -- President Kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million American workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million Americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs.
The President, in a special message to Congress, tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships, build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child health care and general medical research.
The aged care plan, similar to one the President sponsored last year as a senator, a fight on Capitol hill.
It was defeated in Congress last year.
Cost up to $37 a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as $37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes.
The social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent -- 3 per cent on each worker and employer -- on the first $4,800 of pay per year.
The Kennedy plan alone would boost the base to $5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent -- 3.25 per cent each.
Similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system.
The payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting Jan. 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs.
Outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963.
Both figures would go higher in later years.
Other parts of the Kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years.
These would be paid for out of general, not payroll, taxes.
Nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems : 1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would pay $10 a day of the cost for the first nine days.
2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital.
A patient could receive up to 300 days paid-for nursing home care under a unit formula allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospital-care credit.
3 hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of $20 a patient.
4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness.
The President noted that Congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged.
Calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers' expense, but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings -- or those of their children -- caused by an extended hospital stay.
This is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs, he said, and with sufficient deductible requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals.
This is not a program of socialized medicine.
It is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed.
Every person will choose his own doctor and hospital.
Wouldn't pay doctors the plan does not cover doctor bills.
They would still be paid by the patient.
Apart from the aged care plan the President's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships, and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools.
The President said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care.
Moreover, he said, many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they can't afford the schooling costs.
Contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to $1,500 a year for one-fourth of the first year students.
The schools could use the money to pay 4-year scholarships, based on need, of up to $2,000 a year per student.
In addition, the government would pay a $1,000 cost of education grant to the schools for each $1,500 in scholarship grants.
Officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966.
The President recommended federal matching grants totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones.
More for nursing homes in the area of community health services, the President called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction.
He asked for another 10 million dollar initial appropriation for stimulatory grants to states to improve nursing homes.
He further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals.
In the child health field, the President said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau.
He also asked Congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute.
Asks research funds the President said he will ask Congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation.
He did not say by how much.
For medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, in matching grants for building research facilities.
The President said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540 million dollars in the 1961-62 budget for direct government research in medicine.
The President said his proposals combine the indispensable elements in a sound health program -- people, knowledge, services, facilities, and the means to pay for them.
Reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines.
Legislators who last year opposed placing aged-care under the social security system criticized the President's plan.
Those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message.
Senate Republican Leader Dirksen ( Ill. ) and House Republican Leader Charles Halleck ( Ind. ) said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance.
Halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first.
House Speaker Sam Rayburn ( D., Tex. ) called the Kennedy program a mighty fine thing, but made no prediction on its fate in the House.
Washington, Feb. 9 -- acting hastily under White House pressure, the Senate tonight confirmed Robert C. Weaver as the nation's federal housing chief.
Only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote.
A number of scattered ayes and noes was heard.
Customary Senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the Negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency.
In the last eight years, all Presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been denied immediate action because of a Senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor.
Enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of Sen. Wayne Morse ( D., Ore. ) in connection with President Eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and President Kennedy's in 1961.
Oslo the most positive element to emerge from the Oslo meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organization Foreign Ministers has been the freer, franker, and wider discussions, animated by much better mutual understanding than in past meetings.
This has been a working session of an organization that, by its very nature, can only proceed along its route step by step and without dramatic changes.
In Oslo, the ministers have met in a climate of candor, and made a genuine attempt to get information and understanding one another's problems.
This atmosphere of understanding has been particularly noticeable where relations are concerned between the colonialist powers and those who have never, or not for a long time, had such problems.
The nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in Africa, exacerbated by the difficulties, changes, and tragedies facing them, and other allies who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstances that have brought these troubles about, has been conspicuous by its absence.
Explosion avoided in the case of Portugal, which a few weeks ago was rumored ready to walk out of the *j Council should critics of its Angola policy prove harsh, there has been a noticeable relaxation of tension.
The general, remarkably courteous, explanation has left basic positions unchanged, but there has been no explosion in the council.
There should even be no more bitter surprises in the *j General Assembly as to *j members' votes, since a new ad hoc *j committee has been set up so that in the future such topics as Angola will be discussed in advance.
Canada alone has been somewhat out of step with the Oslo attempt to get all the allied cars back on the track behind the *j locomotive.
Even Norway, despite daily but limited manifestations against atomic arms in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance, is today closer to the *j line.
On the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the United States leadership has not been as much in evidence as hoped for.
One diplomat described the tenor of Secretary of State Dean Rusk's speeches as inconclusive.
But he hastened to add that, if United States policies were not always clear, despite Mr. Rusk's analysis of the various global danger points and setbacks for the West, this may merely mean the new administration has not yet firmly fixed its policy.
Exploratory mood a certain vagueness may also be caused by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meeting is a semipublic affair, with no fewer than six Soviet correspondents accredited.
The impression has nevertheless been given during these three days, despite Mr. Rusk's personal popularity, that the United States delegation came to Oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind, more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detailed application to individual danger spots.
The Secretary of State himself, in his first speech, gave some idea of the tremendous march of events inside and outside the United States that has preoccupied the new administration in the past four months.
But where the core of *j is concerned, the Secretary of State has not only reiterated the United States' profound attachment to the alliance, cornerstone of its foreign policy, but has announced that five nuclear submarines will eventually be at *j disposal in European waters.
The Secretary of State has also solemnly repeated a warning to the Soviet Union that the United States will not stand for another setback in Berlin, an affirmation once again taken up by the council as a whole.
Conflict surveyed the secretary's greatest achievement is perhaps the rekindling of *j realization that East-*west friction, wherever it take place around the globe, is in essence the general conflict between two entirely different societies, and must be treated as such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection.
The annual spring meeting has given an impetus in three main directions : more, deeper, and more timely political consultation within the alliance, the use of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( when ratified ) as a method of coordinating aid to the underdeveloped countries, and the need for strengthening conventional forces as well as the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent.
This increase in the threshold, as the conventional forces strengthening is called, will prove one of the alliance's most difficult problems in the months to come.
Each ally will have to carry out obligations long since laid down, but never completely fulfilled.
Washington the Kennedy administration moves haltingly toward a Geneva conference on Laos just as serious debate over its foreign policy erupts for the first time.
There is little optimism here that the Communists will be any more docile at the conference table than they were in military actions on the ground in Laos.
The United States, State Department officials explain, now is mainly interested in setting up an international inspection system which will prevent Laos from being used as a base for Communist attacks on neighboring Thailand and South Viet Nam.
They count on the aid of the neutral countries attending the Geneva conference to achieve this.
The United States hopes that any future Lao Cabinet would not become Communist dominated.
But it is apparent that no acceptable formula has been found to prevent such a possibility.
Policies modified the inclination here is to accept a de facto cease-fire in Laos, rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participating in the Geneva conference.
This is another of the modifications of policy on Laos that the Kennedy administration has felt compelled to make.
It excuses these actions as being the chain reaction to basic errors made in the previous administration.
Its spokesmen insist that there has not been time enough to institute reforms in military and economic aid policies in the critical areas.
But with the months moving on -- and the immediate confrontations with the Communists showing no gain for the free world -- the question arises : how effective have Kennedy administration first foreign policy decisions been in dealing with Communist aggression?
Former Vice-*president Richard M. Nixon in Detroit called for a firmer and tougher policy toward the Soviet Union.
He was critical of what he feels is President Kennedy's tendency to be too conciliatory.
*j G*o*p restrained it does not take a Gallup poll to find out that most Republicans in Congress feel this understates the situation as Republicans see it.
They can hardly restrain themselves from raising the question of whether Republicans, if they had been in power, would have made amateurish and monumental blunders in Cuba.
One Republican senator told this correspondent that he was constantly being asked why he didn't attack the Kennedy administration on this score.
His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the need for unity in the country now.
But he further said that it was better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies first.
The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through Senator Thruston B. Morton ( R ) of Kentucky, chairman of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition government susceptible of Communist domination.
Kennedy administration policies also have been assailed now from another direction by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology educators.
Detente urged this group pleads with the administration to give no further support for the invasion of Cuba by exile groups.
It recommends that the United States seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations ; and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian nationalism feeds.
Mr. Nixon, for his part, would oppose intervention in Cuba without specific provocation.
But he did recommend that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.
Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories in Laos, almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by Mr. Nixon and the professors.
Aid plans revamped very early in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels, a high official source disclosed, that the new administration would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during the formative period of the administration.
Strenuous efforts were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements.
Policies on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed.
But thus far there has been no response in kind.
Foreign aid programs were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nations.
In Laos, the administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters as a useless gesture.
Again and again it asked the Communists to freeze the military situation in Laos.
But the Communists aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.
And after several correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the huge build-up, administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a great service and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization.
*j S*e*a*t*o was steamed up and prepared contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos.
But the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos.
( some *j nations disagreed, however.
) there was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.
The administration declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos.
The pro-*western government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against the Souvanna Phouma neutralist government, never did appear to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.
There certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United States would not back the pro-*western government to the hilt.
If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.
One factor was the statement of Senator J. W. Fulbright ( D ) of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a year and a half ago by encouraging the removal of Prince Souvanna.
Washington the White House is taking extraordinary steps to check the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.
The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect upon the vitality of the nation.
In an important assertion of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.
The President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend.
Offenses multiply the President has also called upon the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts in the development of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.
Simultaneously the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L. Hackett, a special assistant to the Attorney General, as executive director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth Crime.
His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the fact that court cases and juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.
Among arrests reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.
East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin by appointing a full-time director, Raymond H. Hawksley, the present city *j head, believes.
Mr. Hawksley said yesterday he would be willing to go before the city council or anyone else locally to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.
East Providence now has no civil defense program.
Mr. Hawksley, the state's general treasurer, has been a part-time *j director in the city for the last nine years.
He is not interested in being named a full-time director.
Noting that President Kennedy has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for the nation's civil defense program, Mr. Hawksley said the federal government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.
He expressed the opinion the city could hire a *j director for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount on a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.
Mr. Hawksley said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents who would be willing to take the full-time *j job.
One of these men is former Fire Chief John A. Laughlin, he said.
Along with a director, the city should provide a *j headquarters so that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized.
Mr. Hawksley said.
One advantage that would come to the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense program.
Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said.
Mr. Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue trucks, similar to the *j vehicle obtained several years ago and now detailed to the Central Fire Station.
He would assign one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the other to the Rumford area.
Speaking of the present status of civil defense in the city, Mr. Hawksley said he would be willing to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.
The Narragansett Race Track grounds is one assembly point, he said, and a drive-in theater in Seekonk would be another.
Riverside residents would go to the Seekonk assembly point.
Mr. Hawksley said he was not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to assemble in case of an air attack.
Such vital information, he said, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular intervals for residents to know.
If the city council fails to consider appointment of a full-time *j director, Mr. Hawksley said, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a civil defense organization will be developed locally.
One of the first things he would do, he said, would be to organize classes in first aid.
Other steps would be developed after information drifts down to the local level from the federal government.
Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible revisions in mind.
Governor Notte said last night he plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations for possible changes in time for the next session of the General Assembly.
The governor's move into the so-called blue law controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R. Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls.
A copy was released to the press.
Mr. Notte was responding to a resolution adopted by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state house by Miss Grant.
The resolution urges the governor to have a complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision at the next session of the legislature.
While the city council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review, Mr. Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent to get the benefit of his views.
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr. Nugent's cooperation, the governor said.
I would expect the proposed committee to hold public hearings, Mr. Notte said, to obtain the views of the general public and religious, labor and special-interest groups affected by these laws.
The governor wrote Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time with the continuous problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales.
The attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce the blue laws.
Should there be evidence they are shirking, he has said, the state police will step into the situation.
There has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales laws.
The statutes, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.
The Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.
The only day they have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on Sunday, the council's resolution said.
The small shops must be retained, for they provide essential service to the community, according to the resolution, which added that they also are the source of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors.
It declares that Sunday sales licenses provide great revenue to the local government.
The council advised the governor that large supermarkets, factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business on Sunday.
They operate on a volume basis, it was contended, and are not essential to provide the more limited but vital shopping needs of the community.
Liberals and conservatives in both parties -- democratic and Republican -- should divorce themselves and form two independent parties, George H. Reama, nationally known labor-management expert, said here yesterday.
Mr. Reama told the Rotary Club of Providence at its luncheon at the Sheraton-*biltmore Hotel that about half of the people in the country want the welfare type of government and the other half want a free enterprise system.
He suggested that a regrouping of forces might allow the average voter a better pull at the right lever for him on election day.
He said he was confessing that I was a member of the Socialist Party in 1910.
That, he added, was when he was a very young man, a machinist and toolmaker by trade.
That was before I studied law.
Some of my fellow workers were grooming me for an office in the Socialist Party.
The lawyer with whom I studied law steered me off the Socialist track.
He steered me to the right track -- the free enterprise track.
He said that when he was a Socialist in 1910, the party called for government operation of all utilities and the pooling of all resources.
He suggested that without the Socialist Party ever gaining a national victory, most of its original program has come to pass under both major parties.
Mr. Reama, who retired as vice president of the American Screw Co. in 1955 said, both parties in the last election told us that we need a five per cent growth in the gross national product -- but neither told us how to achieve it.
He said he favors wage increases for workers -- but manufacturers are caught in a profit squeeze -- and raises should only come when the public is conditioned to higher prices, he added.
Indicating the way in which he has turned his back on his 1910 philosophy, Mr. Reama said : a Socialist is a person who believes in dividing everything he does not own.
Mr. Reama, far from really being retired, is engaged in industrial relations counseling.
A petition bearing the signatures of more than 1,700 Johnston taxpayers was presented to the town council last night as what is hoped will be the first step in obtaining a home rule charter for the town.
William A. Martinelli, chairman of the Citizens Group of Johnston, transferred the petitions from his left hand to his right hand after the council voted to accept them at the suggestion of Council President Raymond Fortin Sr..
The law which governs home rule charter petitions states that they must be referred to the chairman of the board of canvassers for verification of the signatures within 10 days and Mr. Martinelli happens to hold that post.
Mr. Martinelli explained that there should be more than enough signatures to assure the scheduling of a vote on the home rule charter and possible election of a nine member charter commission within 70 days.
He explained that by law the council must establish procedures for a vote on the issue within 60 days after the board of canvassers completes its work.
A difference of opinion arose between Mr. Martinelli and John P. Bourcier, town solicitor, over the exact manner in which the vote is handled.
Mr. Martinelli has, in recent weeks, been of the opinion that a special town meeting would be called for the vote, while Mr. Bourcier said that a special election might be called instead.
Mr. Bourcier said that he had consulted several Superior Court justices in the last week and received opinions favoring both procedures.
He assured Mr. Martinelli and the council that he would study the correct method and report back to the council as soon as possible.
Mr. Martinelli said yesterday that the Citizens Group of Johnston will meet again July 24 to plan further strategy in the charter movement.
He said that the group has no candidates for the charter commission in mind at present, but that it will undoubtedly endorse candidates when the time comes.
After inspiring this, I think we should certainly follow through on it, he declared.
It has become our responsibility and I hope that the Citizens Group will spearhead the movement.
He said he would not be surprised if some of the more than 30 members of the group are interested in running on the required non-partisan ballot for posts on the charter commission.
Our most immediate goal is to increase public awareness of the movement, he indicated, and to tell them what this will mean for the town.
He expects that if the present timetable is followed a vote will be scheduled during the last week in September.
Some opposition to the home rule movement started to be heard yesterday, with spokesmen for the town's insurgent Democratic leadership speaking out against the home rule charter in favor of the model municipal league charter.
Increasing opposition can be expected in coming weeks, it was indicated.
Misunderstanding of the real meaning of a home rule charter was cited as a factor which has caused the Citizens Group to obtain signatures under what were termed false pretenses.
Several signers affixed their names, it was learned, after being told that no tax increase would be possible without consent of the General Assembly and that a provision could be included in the charter to have the town take over the Johnston Sanitary District sewer system.
Action on a new ordinance permitting motorists who plead guilty to minor traffic offenses to pay fines at the local police station may be taken at Monday's special North Providence Town Council meeting.
Council president Frank San*antonio said yesterday he may ask the council to formally request Town Solicitor Michael A. Abatuno to draft the ordinance.
At the last session of the General Assembly, the town was authorized to adopt such an ordinance as a means of making enforcement of minor offenses more effective.
Nothing has been done yet to take advantage of the enabling legislation.
At present all offenses must be taken to Sixth District Court for disposition.
Local police have hesitated to prosecute them because of the heavy court costs involved even for the simplest offense.
Plainfield -- James P. Mitchell and Sen. Walter H. Jones *j, last night disagreed on the value of using as a campaign issue a remark by Richard J. Hughes, Democratic gubernatorial candidate, that the *j is campaigning on the carcass of Eisenhower Republicanism.
Mitchell was for using it, Jones against, and Sen. Wayne Dumont Jr. *j did not mention it when the three Republican gubernatorial candidates spoke at staggered intervals before 100 persons at the Park Hotel.
The controversial remark was first made Sunday by Hughes at a Westfield Young Democratic Club cocktail party at the Scotch Plains Country Club.
It was greeted with a chorus of boos by 500 women in Trenton Monday at a forum of the State Federation of Women's Clubs.
Hughes said Monday, it is the apparent intention of the Republican Party to campaign on the carcass of what they call Eisenhower Republicanism, but the heart stopped beating and the lifeblood congealed after Eisenhower retired.
Now he's gone, the Republican Party is not going to be able to sell the tattered remains to the people of the state.
Sunday he had added, we can love Eisenhower the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership.
Mitchell said the statement should become a major issue in the primary and the fall campaign.
How can a man with any degree of common decency charge this?
He asked.
The former secretary of labor said he was proud to be an Eisenhower Republican and proud to have absorbed his philosophy while working in his adminstration.
Mitchell said the closeness of the outcome in last fall's Presidential election did not mean that Eisenhower Republicanism was a dead issue.
Regrets attack Jones said he regretted Hughes had made a personal attack on a past president.
He is wrong to inject Eisenhower into this campaign, he said, because the primary is being waged on state issues and I will not be forced into re-arguing an old national campaign.
The audience last night did not respond with either applause or boos to mention of Hughes' remark.
Dumont spoke on the merit of having an open primary.
He then launched into what the issues should be in the campaign.
State aid to schools, the continuance of railroad passenger service, the proper uses of surplus funds of the Port of New York Authority, and making New Jersey attractive to new industry.
Decries joblessness Mitchell decried the high rate of unemployment in the state and said the Meyner administration and the Republican-controlled State Senate must share the blame for this.
Noting that Plainfield last year had lost the Mack Truck Co. plant, he said industry will not come into this state until there is tax reform.
But I am not in favor of a sales or state income tax at this time, Mitchell said.
Jones, unhappy that the candidates were limited to eight minutes for a speech and no audience questions, saved his barbs for Mitchell.
He said Mitchell is against the centralization of government in Washington but looks to the Kennedy Administration for aid to meet New Jersey school and transportation crises.
He calls for help while saying he is against centralization, but you can't have it both ways, Jones said.
The state is now faced with the immediate question of raising new taxes whether on utilities, real estate or motor vehicles, he said, and I challenge Mitchell to tell the people where he stands on the tax issue.
Defends Ike earlier, Mitchell said in a statement : I think that all Americans will resent deeply the statements made about President Eisenhower by Richard J. Hughes.
His reference to discredited carcass or tattered remains of the president's leadership is an insult to the man who led our forces to victory in the greatest war in all history, to the man who was twice elected overwhelmingly by the American people as president of the United States, and who has been the symbol to the world of the peace-loving intentions of the free nations.
I find it hard to understand how anyone seeking a position in public life could demonstrate such poor judgment and bad taste.
Such a vicious statement can only have its origin in the desire of a new political candidate to try to make his name known by condemning a man of world stature.
It can only rebound to Mr. Hughes' discredit.
Sees Jones ahead Sen. Charles W. Sandman, *j May, said today Jones will run well ahead of his *j opponents for the gubernatorial nomination.
Sandman, state campaign chairman for Jones, was addressing a meeting in the Military Park Hotel, Newark, of Essex County leaders and campaign managers for Jones.
Sandman told the gathering that reports from workers on a local level all over the state indicate that Jones will be chosen the Republican Party's nominee with the largest majority given a candidate in recent years.
Sandman said : the announcement that Sen. Clifford Case *j, has decided to spend all his available time campaigning for Mr. Mitchell is a dead giveaway.
It is a desperate effort to prop up a sagging candidate who has proven he cannot answer any questions about New Jersey's problems.
We have witnessed in this campaign the effort to project Mr. Mitchell as the image of a unity candidate from Washington.
That failed.
We are now witnessing an effort to transfer to Mr. Mitchell some of the glow of Sen. Case's candidacy of last year.
That, too, will fail.
Sandman announced the appointment of Mrs. Harriet Copeland Greenfield of 330 Woodland Ave., Westfield, as state chairman of the Republican Women for Jones Committee.
Mrs. Greenfield is president of the Westfield Women's Republican Club and is a Westfield county committeewoman.
County Supervisor Weldon R. Sheets, who is a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination, today called for an end to paper ballots in those counties in the state which still use them.
The proposal, Sheets said, represents part of his program for election reforms necessary to make democracy in New Jersey more than a lip service word.
Sheets said that his proposed law would offer state financing aid for the purchase of voting machines, enabling counties to repay the loan over a 10-year period without interest or charge.
Sheets added that he would ask for exclusive use of voting machines in the state by January, 1964.
Although he pointed out that mandatory legislation impinging on home rule is basically distasteful, he added that the vital interest in election results transcended county lines.
The candidacy of Mayor James J. Sheeran of West Orange, for the Republican nomination for sheriff of Essex County, was supported today by Edward W. Roos, West Orange public safety commissioner.
Sheeran, a lawyer and former *j man is running against the Republican organization's candidate, Freeholder William Mac*donald, for the vacancy left by the resignation of Neil Duffy, now a member of the State Board of Tax Appeals.
My experience as public safety commissioner, Roos said, has shown me that the office of sheriff is best filled by a man with law enforcement experience, and preferably one who is a lawyer.
Jim Sheeran fits that description.
Trenton -- William J. Seidel, state fire warden in the Department of Conservation and Economic Development, has retired after 36 years of service.
A citation from Conservation Commissioner Salvatore A. Bontempo credits his supervision with a reduction in the number of forest fires in the state.
Seidel joined the department in 1925 as a division fire warden after graduation in 1921 from the University of Michigan with a degree in forestry and employment with private lumber companies.
In October 1944, he was appointed state warden and chief of the Forest Fire Section.
Under his supervision, the state fire-fighting agency developed such techniques as plowing of fire lines and established a fleet of tractor plows and tractor units for fire fighting.
He also expanded and modernized the radio system with a central control station.
He introduced regular briefing sessions for district fire wardens and first aid training for section wardens.
He is credited with setting up an annual co-operative fire prevention program in co-operation with the Red Cross and State Department of Education.
Boonton -- Richard J. Hughes made his Morris County debut in his bid for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination here last night with a pledge to carry the issues to every corner of the state.
He promised nearly 200 Democratic county committee members at the meeting in the Puddingstone Inn : when I come back here after the November election you'll think, you're my man -- elected.
He said you're the kind of governor we're glad we, we Democrats must resolve our issues on the test of what is right and just, and not what is expedient at the time.
Attacks Republicans in his only attack on the Republicans, Hughes said, the three Republican candidates for governor are tripping over their feet for popular slogans to win the primary.
But we'll have a liberal, well planned, forward looking, honest platform.
We'll not talk out of one side of our mouth in Morris County and out of the other side in Hudson.
We'll take the truth to the people, and the people will like the truth and elect their candidate and party in November.
He said, you can see signs of the Republicans' feeble attack on the Meyner administration.
But I shall campaign on the Meyner record to meet the needs of the years ahead.
He urged New Jersey to become a full partner in the courageous actions of President Kennedy.
He called for a greater attraction of industry and a stop to the piracy of industry by Southern states, and a strong fight against discrimination in business and industry.
We must keep the bloodstream of New Jersey clean, the former Superior Court judge said.
To prevent hoodlums from infiltrating the state as they did in the Republican administration in the early 1940s.
Calling the Democrats the party that lives, breathes and thinks for the good of the people, Hughes asked, a representative Democratic vote in the primary for a springboard toward victory in November.
Hughes supported Gov. Meyner's Green Acres plan for saving large tracts of open land from the onrush of urban development.
He said legislation for a $60 million bond issue to underwrite the program is expected to be introduced Monday.
Conservation plan the plan will provide $45 million for purchase of open land by the state.
The other $15 million is to be alloted to municipalities on a matching fund basis.
Hughes said, this is not a plan to conquer space -- but to conserve it, pointing out the state population has increased 125,000 each year since 1950.
He said Morris County is rapidly changing and unless steps are taken to preserve the green areas, there will be no land left to preserve.
Hughes would not comment on tax reforms or other issues in which the Republican candidates are involved.
He said no matter what stand he takes it would be misconstrued that he was sympathetic to one or the other of the Republicans.
After the primary, he promised, I'll be explicit on where I stand to bring you a strong, dynamic administration.
I'm not afraid to tangle with the Republican nominee.
Trenton -- fifteen members of the Republican State Committee who are retiring -- voluntarily -- this year were honored yesterday by their colleagues.
The outgoing members, whose four-year terms will expire a week after the April 18 primary election, received carved wooden elephants, complete with ivory tusks, to remember the state committee by.
There may be other 1961 state committee retirements come April 18, but they will be leaving by choice of the Republican voters.
A special presentation was made to Mrs. Geraldine Thompson of Red Bank, who is stepping down after 35 years on the committee.
She also was the original *j national committeewoman from New Jersey in the early 1920s following adoption of the women's suffrage amendment.
She served one four-year term on the national committee.
Resentment welled up yesterday among Democratic district leaders and some county leaders at reports that Mayor Wagner had decided to seek a third term with Paul R. Screvane and Abraham D. Beame as running mates.
At the same time reaction among anti-organization Democratic leaders and in the Liberal party to the Mayor's reported plan was generally favorable.
Some anti-organization Democrats saw in the program an opportunity to end the bitter internal fight within the Democratic party that has been going on for the last three years.
The resentment among Democratic organization leaders to the reported Wagner plan was directed particularly at the Mayor's efforts to name his own running mates without consulting the leaders.
Some viewed this attempt as evidence that Mr. Wagner regarded himself as bigger than the party.
Opposition reported some Democratic district and county leaders are reported trying to induce State Controller Arthur Levitt of Brooklyn to oppose Mr. Wagner for the Mayoral nomination in the Sept. 7 Democratic primary.
These contend there is a serious question as to whether Mr. Wagner has the confidence of the Democratic rank and file in the city.
Their view is that last-minute changes the Mayor is proposing to make in the Democratic ticket only emphasize the weakness of his performance as Mayor.
In an apparent effort to head off such a rival primary slate, Mr. Wagner talked by telephone yesterday with Representative Charles A. Buckley, the Bronx Democratic leader, and with Joseph T. Sharkey, the Brooklyn Democratic leader.
Mayor visits Buckley as usual, he made no attempt to get in touch with Carmine G. De Sapio, the Manhattan leader.
He is publicly on record as believing Mr. De Sapio should be replaced for the good of the party.
Last night the Mayor visited Mr. Buckley at the Bronx leader's home for a discussion of the situation.
Apparently he believes Mr. Buckley holds the key to the Democratic organization's acceptance of his choices for running mates without a struggle.
In talks with Mr. Buckley last week in Washington, the Mayor apparently received the Bronx leader's assent to dropping Controller Lawrence E. Gerosa, who lives in the Bronx, from this year's ticket.
But Mr. Buckley seems to have assumed he would be given the right to pick Mr. Gerosa's successor.
Screvane and Beame hailed the Mayor declined in two interviews with reporters yesterday to confirm or deny the reports that he had decided to run and wanted Mr. Screvane, who lives in Queens, to replace Abe Stark, the incumbent, as the candidate for President of the City Council and Mr. Beame, who lives in Brooklyn, to replace Mr. Gerosa as the candidate for Controller.
The Mayor spoke yesterday at the United Irish Counties Feis on the Hunter College Campus in the Bronx.
After his speech, reporters asked him about the report of his political intentions, published in yesterday's New York Times.
The Mayor said : it didn't come from me.
But as I have said before, if I announce my candidacy, I will have something definite to say about running mates.
Boston, June 16 -- a wave of public resentment against corruption in government is rising in Massachusetts.
There is a tangible feeling in the air of revulsion toward politics.
The taxi driver taking the visitor from the airport remarks that politicians in the state are all the same.
It's see Joe, see Jim, he says.
The hand is out.
A political scientist writes of the growth of alienated voters, who believe that voting is useless because politicians or those who influence politicians are corrupt, selfish and beyond popular control.
These voters view the political process as a secret conspiracy, the object of which is to plunder them.
Corruption is hardly a recent development in the city and state that were widely identified as the locale of Edwin O'*connor's novel, The Last Hurrah.
But there are reasons for the current spotlight on the subject.
A succession of highly publicized scandals has aroused the public within the last year.
Graft in the construction of highways and other public works has brought on state and Federal investigations.
And the election of President Kennedy has attracted new attention to the ethical climate of his home state.
A reader of the Boston newspapers can hardly escape the impression that petty chicanery, or worse, is the norm in Massachusetts public life.
Day after day some new episode is reported.
The state Public Works Department is accused of having spent $8,555 to build a private beach for a state judge on his waterfront property.
An assistant attorney general is directed to investigate.
Washington, June 18 -- Congress starts another week tomorrow with sharply contrasting forecasts for the two chambers.
In the Senate, several bills are expected to pass without any major conflict or opposition.
In the House, the Southern-*republican coalition is expected to make another major stand in opposition to the Administration's housing bill, while more jockeying is expected in an attempt to advance the aid-to-education bill.
The housing bill is now in the House Rules Committee.
It is expected to be reported out Tuesday, but this is a little uncertain.
The panel's action depends on the return of Representative James W. Trimble, Democrat of Arkansas, who has been siding with Speaker Sam Rayburn's forces in the Rules Committee in moving bills to the floor.
Mr. Trimble has been in the hospital but is expected back Tuesday.
Leadership is hopeful the housing bill is expected to encounter strong opposition by the coalition of Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans.
The Democratic leadership, however, hopes to pass it sometime this week.
The $6,100,000,000 measure, which was passed last Monday by the Senate, provides for forty-year mortgages at low down-payments for moderate-income families.
It also provides for funds to clear slums and help colleges build dormitories.
The education bill appears to be temporarily stalled in the Rules Committee, where two Northern Democratic members who usually vote with the Administration are balking because of the religious controversy.
They are James J. Delaney of Queens and Thomas P. O'*neill Jr. of Massachusetts.
Three groups to meet what could rescue the bill would be some quick progress on a bill amending the National Defense Education Act of 1958.
This would provide for long-term Federal loans for construction of parochial and other private-school facilities for teaching science, languages and mathematics.
Mr. Delaney and Mr. O'*neill are not willing to vote on the public-school measure until the defense education bill clears the House Education and Labor Committee.
About half of all Peace Corps projects assigned to voluntary agencies will be carried out by religious groups, according to an official of the corps.
In the $40,000,000 budget that has been submitted for Congressional approval, $26,000,000 would be spent through universities and private voluntary agencies.
Twelve projects proposed by private groups are at the contract-negotiation stage, Gordon Boyce, director of relations with the voluntary agencies, said in a Washington interview.
Six of these were proposed by religious groups.
They will be for teaching, agriculture and community development in Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.
Question raised interviews with several church leaders have disclosed that this development has raised the question whether the Peace Corps will be able to prevent confusion for church and state over methods, means and goals.
There are a number of ways this could happen, the churchmen pointed out, and here is an example : last month in Ghana an American missionary discovered when he came to pay his hotel bill that the usual rate had been doubled.
When he protested, the hotel owner said : why do you worry?
The U. S. Government is paying for it.
The U. S. Government pays for all its overseas workers.
Missionary explains I don't work for the Government, the American said.
I'm a missionary.
The hotel owner shrugged.
Same thing, he said.
And then, some churchmen remarked, there is a more classical church-state problem : can religious agencies use Government funds and Peace Corps personnel in their projects and still preserve the constitutional requirement on separation of church and state?
R. Sargent Shriver Jr., director of the corps, is certain that they can.
No religious group, he declared in an interview, will receive Peace Corps funds unless it forswears all proselytizing on the project it proposes.
Moscow, June 18 -- at a gay party in the Kremlin for President Sukarno of Indonesia, Premier Khrushchev pulled out his pockets and said, beaming : look, he took everything I had ] Mr. Khrushchev was jesting in the expansive mood of the successful banker.
Indonesia is one of the twenty under-developed countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America that are receiving Soviet aid.
The Soviet Union and other members of the Communist bloc are rapidly expanding their economic, technical and military assistance to the uncommitted nations.
The Communist countries allocated more than $1,000,000,000 in economic aid alone last year, according to Western estimates.
This was the biggest annual outlay since the Communist program for the under-developed countries made its modest beginning in 1954.
In 1960 more than 6,000 Communist technicians were present in those countries.
United Nations, N. Y., June 18 -- a committee of experts has recommended that a country's population be considered in the distribution of professional posts at the United Nations.
This was disclosed today by a responsible source amid intensified efforts by the Soviet Union to gain a greater role in the staff and operation of the United Nations.
One effect of the proposal, which puts a premium on population instead of economic strength, as in the past, would be to take jobs from European nations and give more to such countries as India.
India is the most populous United Nations member with more than 400,000,000 inhabitants.
The new formula for filling staff positions in the Secretariat is one of a number of recommendations made by a panel of eight in a long and detailed report.
The report was completed after nearly eighteen months of work on the question of the organization of the United Nations.
Formula is due this week the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions is expected to receive the report this week.
The jobs formula is understood to follow these lines : each of the organization's ninety-nine members would get two professional posts, such as political affairs officer, a department head or an economist, to start.
Each member would get one post for each 10,000,000 people in its population up to 150,000,000 people or a maximum of fifteen posts.
Each member with a population above 150,000,000 would get one additional post for each additional 30,000,000 people up to an unspecified cut-off point.
Geneva, June 18 -- the three leaders of Laos agreed today to begin negotiations tomorrow on forming a coalition government that would unite the war-ridden kingdom.
The decision was made in Zurich by Prince Boun Oum, Premier of the pro-*western royal Government ; Prince Souvanna Phouma, leader of the nation's neutralists and recognized as Premier by the Communist bloc, and Prince Souphanouvong, head of the pro-*communist Pathet Lao forces.
The latter two are half-brothers.
Their joint statement was welcomed by the Western delegations who will attend tomorrow the nineteenth plenary session of the fourteen-nation conference on the future of Laos.
An agreement among the Princes on a coalition government would ease their task, diplomats conceded.
But no one was overly optimistic.
Tactics studied in Geneva W. Averell Harriman of the United States, Malcolm Mac*donald of Britain, Maurice Couve De Murville, France's Foreign Minister, and Howard C. Green, Canada's Minister of External Affairs, concluded, meanwhile, a round of consultations here on future tactics in the conference.
The pace of the talks has slowed with each passing week.
Princess Moune, Prince Souvanna Phouma's young daughter, read the Princes' statement.
They had a two-hour luncheon together in an atmosphere of cordial understanding and relaxation, she said.
The three Laotians agreed upon a six-point agenda for their talks, which are to last three days.
The Princess said it was too early to say what would be decided if no agreement was reached after three days.
To deal with principles the meetings in Zurich, the statement said, would deal only with principles that would guide the three factors in their search for a coalition Government.
Appointment of William S. Pfaff Jr., 41, as promotion manager of The Times-*picayune Publishing Company was announced Saturday by John F. Tims, president of the company.
Pfaff succeeds Martin Burke, who resigned.
The new promotion manager has been employed by the company since January, 1946, as a commercial artist in the advertising department.
He is a native of New Orleans and attended Allen Elementary school, Fortier High school and Soule business college.
From June, 1942, until December, 1945, Pfaff served in the Army Air Corps.
While in the service he attended radio school at Scott Field in Belleville, Ill..
Before entering the service, Pfaff for five years did clerical work with a general merchandising and wholesale firm in New Orleans.
He is married to the former Audrey Knecht and has a daughter, Karol, 13.
They reside at 4911 Miles Dr..
Washington -- thousands of bleacher-type seats are being erected along Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and the White House for the big inaugural parade on Jan. 20.
Assuming the weather is halfway decent that day, hundreds of thousands of persons will mass along this thoroughfare as President John F. Kennedy and retiring President Dwight D. Eisenhower leave Capitol Hill following the oath-taking ceremonies and ride down this historic ceremonial route.
Pennsylvania Avenue, named for one of the original 13 states, perhaps is not the most impressive street in the District of Columbia from a commercial standpoint.
But from a historic viewpoint none can approach it.
Many buildings within view of the avenue are some of the United States government's tremendous buildings, plus shrines and monuments.
Of course, 1600 Pennsylvania, the White House, is the most famous address of the free world.
Within an easy walk from Capitol Hill where Pennsylvania Avenue comes together with Constitution Avenue, begins a series of great federal buildings, some a block long and all about seven-stories high.
Great chapters of history have been recorded along the avenue, now about 169 years old.
In the early spring of 1913 a few hundred thousand persons turned out to watch 5000 women parade.
They were the suffragettes and they wanted to vote.
In the 1920 presidential election they had that right and many of them did vote for the first time.
Seats on square along this avenue which saw marching soldiers from the War Between the States returning in 1865 is the National Archives building where hundreds of thousands of this country's most valuable records are kept.
Also the department of justice building is located where J. Edgar Hoover presides over the federal bureau of investigation.
Street car tracks run down the center of Pennsylvania, powered with lines that are underground.
Many spectators will be occupying seats and vantage points bordering Lafayette Square, opposite the White House.
In this historic square are several statues, but the one that stands out over the others is that of Gen. Andrew Jackson, hero of the Battle of New Orleans.
Moving past the presidential viewing stand and Lafayette Square will be at least 40 marching units.
About 16,000 military members of all branches of the armed forces will take part in the parade.
Division one of the parade will be the service academies.
Division two will include the representations of Massachusetts and Texas, the respective states of the President and of Vice-*president L. B. Johnson.
Then will come nine other states in the order of their admission to the union.
Division three will be headed by the Marines followed by 12 states ; division four will be headed by the Navy, followed by 11 states ; division five, by the Air Force followed by 11 states.
Division six will be headed by the Coast Guard, followed by the reserve forces of all services, five states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the trust territories and the Canal Zone.
Jackson, Miss. -- what does 1961 offer in political and governmental developments in Mississippi?
Even for those who have been observing the political scene a long time, no script from the past is worth very much in gazing into the state's immediate political future.
This is largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operates the helm of the state government and is the elected leader of its two million inhabitants -- Gov. Ross Barnett.
Barnett, who came into office with no previous experience in public administration, has surrounded himself with confusion which not only keeps his foes guessing but his friends as well.
Consequently, it is uncertain after nearly 12 months in office just which direction the Barnett administration will take in the coming year.
Could be scramble some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edges which it has had thus far.
The builtin headache of the Barnett regime thus far has been the steady stream of job-seekers and others who feel they were given commitments by Barnett at some stage of his eight-year quest for the governor's office.
There are many who predict that should Barnett decide to call the Legislature back into special session, it will really throw his administration into a scramble.
Certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmakers come back together Barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he had in the 1960 legislative session.
If Barnett doesn't call a special session in 1961, it will be the first year in the last decade that the Legislature has not met in regular or special session.
The odds favor a special session, more than likely early in the year.
Districts issue legislators always get restless for a special session ( whether for the companionship or the $22.50 per diem is not certain ) and if they start agitating.
Barnett is not expected to be able to withstand the pressure.
The issue which may make it necessary to have a session is the highly sensitive problem of cutting the state's congressional districts from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat.
With eyes focused on the third congressional district, the historic Delta district, and Congressman Frank E. Smith as the one most likely to go, the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmakers from the Delta have held in the Legislature.
Mississippi's relations with the national Democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961, with the first Democratic president in eight years in the White House.
Split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divided camps of party loyalists and independents, the Democratic party in Mississippi is currently a wreck.
And there has been no effort since the election to pull it back together.
Future clouded Barnett, as the titular head of the Democratic party, apparently must make the move to reestablish relations with the national Democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist ranks to completely bypass him as a party functionary.
With a Democratic administration, party patronage would normally begin to flow to Mississippi if it had held its Democratic solidarity in the November election.
Now, the picture is clouded, and even *j Sens. James O. Eastland and John C. Stennis, who remained loyal to the ticket, are uncertain of their status.
Reports are that it is more than probable that the four congressmen from Mississippi who did not support the party ticket will be stripped of the usual patronage which flows to congressmen.
Baton Rouge, La. -- the Gov. Jimmie H. Davis administration appears to face a difficult year in 1961, with the governor's theme of peace and harmony subjected to severe stresses.
The year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue.
But it might give way shortly to another vexing issue -- that of finances in state government.
The transition from segregation to finances might already be in progress, in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent.
The administration has said the sales tax proposal is merely part of the segregation strategy, since the revenues from the increase would be dedicated to a grant in aid program.
But the tardiness of the administration in making the dedication has caused legislators to suspect the tax bill was related more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation.
Legislators weary indeed, the administration's curious position on the sales tax was a major factor in contributing to its defeat.
The administration could not say why $28 million was needed for a grant-in-aid program.
The effectiveness of the governor in clearing up some of the inconsistencies revolving about the sales tax bill may play a part in determining whether it can muster the required two-thirds vote.
The tax bill will be up for reconsideration Wednesday in the House when the Legislature reconvenes.
Davis may use the tax bill as a means to effect a transition from special sessions of the Legislature to normalcy.
If it fails to pass, he can throw up his hands and say the Legislature would not support him in his efforts to prevent integration.
He could terminate special sessions of the Legislature.
Actually, Davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway.
Many legislators are already weary and frustrated over the so-far losing battle to block token integration.
This is not the sort of thing most politicos would care to acknowledge publicly.
They would like to convey the notion something is being done, even though it is something they know to be ineffectual.
Underlying concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give Davis the means to effect a transition.
He could tell the Legislature they had provided the needed funds to carry on the battle.
Then he could tell them to go home, while the administration continued to wage the battle with the $28 million in extra revenues the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight months period.
It is difficult to be certain how the administration views that $28 million, since the views of one leader may not be the same as the views of another one.
But if the administration should find it does not need the $28 million for a grant-in-aid program, a not unlikely conclusion, it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purposes.
This would be in perfect consonance with the underlying concern in the administration -- the shortage of cash.
It could become an acute problem in the coming fiscal year.
If the administration does not succeed in passing the sales tax bill, or any other tax bill, it could very well be faced this spring at the fiscal session of the Legislature with an interesting dilemma.
Since the constitution forbids introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session, the administration will either have to cut down expenses or inflate its estimates of anticipated revenues.
Constant problem in either case, it could call a special session of the Legislature later in 1961 to make another stab at raising additional revenues through a tax raiser.
The prospect of cutting back spending is an unpleasant one for any governor.
It is one that most try to avoid, as long as they can see an alternative approach to the problem.
But if all alternatives should be clearly blocked off, it can be expected the Davis administration will take steps to trim spending at the spring session of the state Legislature.
This might be done to arouse those who have been squeezed out by the trims to exert pressure on the Legislature, so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal later in the year.
A constant problem confronting Davis on any proposals for new taxes will be the charge by his foes that he has not tried to economize.
Any tax bill also will revive allegations that some of his followers have been using their administration affiliations imprudently to profit themselves.
The new year might see some house-cleaning, either genuine or token, depending upon developments, to give Davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticisms.
City Controller Alexander Hemphill charged Tuesday that the bids on the Frankford Elevated repair project were rigged to the advantage of a private contracting company which had an inside track with the city.
Estimates of the city's loss in the $344,000 job have ranged as high as $200,000.
Shortcuts unnoticed Hemphill said that the Hughes Steel Erection Co. contracted to do the work at an impossibly low cost with a bid that was far less than the legitimate bids of competing contractors.
The Hughes concern then took shortcuts on the project but got paid anyway, Hemphill said.
The Controller's charge of rigging was the latest development in an investigation which also brought these disclosures Tuesday : the city has sued for the full amount of the $172,400 performance bond covering the contract.
The Philadelphia Transportation Co. is investigating the part its organization played in reviewing the project.
The signature of Harold V. Varani, former director of architecture and engineering in the Department of Public Property, appeared on payment vouchers certifying work on the project.
Varani has been fired on charges of accepting gifts from the contractor.
Managing Director Donald C. Wagner has agreed to cooperate fully with Hemphill after a period of sharp disagreement on the matter.
The announcement that the city would sue for recovery on the performance bond was made by City Solicitor David Berger at a press conference following a meeting in the morning with Wagner and other officials of the city and the *j as well as representatives of an engineering firm that was pulled off the El project before its completion in 1959.
Concern bankrupt the Hughes company and the Consolidated Industries, Inc., both of 3646 N. 2d St., filed for reorganization under the Federal bankruptcy law.
On Monday, the Hughes concern was formally declared bankrupt after its directors indicated they could not draw up a plan for reorganization.
Business relations between the companies and city have been under investigation by Hemphill and District Attorney James C. Crumlish, Jr..
Intervenes in case the suit was filed later in the day in Common Pleas Court 7 against the Hughes company and two bonding firms.
Travelers Indemnity Co. and the Continental Casualty Co..
At Berger's direction, the city also intervened in the Hughes bankruptcy case in U. S. District Court in a move preliminary to filing a claim there.
I am taking the position that the contract was clearly violated, Berger said.
The contract violations mostly involve failure to perform rehabilitation work on expansion joints along the El track.
The contract called for overhauling of 102 joints.
The city paid for work on 75, of which no more than 21 were repaired, Hemphill charged.
Wide range in bids Hemphill said the Hughes concern contracted to do the repairs at a cost of $500 for each joint.
The bid from A. Belanger and Sons of Cambridge, Mass., which listed the same officers as Hughes, was $600 per joint.
But, Hemphill added, bids from other contractors ranged from $2400 to $3100 per joint.
Berger's decision to sue for the full amount of the performance bond was questioned by Wagner in the morning press conference.
Wagner said the city paid only $37,500 to the Hughes company.
We won't know the full amount until we get a full report, Wagner said.
We can claim on the maximum amount of the bond, Berger said.
Wagner replied, can't you just see the headline : city hooked for $172,000?
Know enough to sue Berger insisted that we know enough to sue for the full amount.
Douglas M. Pratt, president of the *j, who attended the meeting, said the transit company is reviewing the work on the El.
We want to find out who knew about it, Pratt said.
Certain people must have known about it.
The *j is investigating the whole matter, Pratt said.
Samuel D. Goodis, representing the Philadelphia Hotel Association, objected on Tuesday to a proposed boost by the city in licensing fees, saying that occupancy rates in major hotels here ranged from 48 to 74 percent last year.
Goodis voiced his objection before City Council's Finance Committee.
For hotels with 1000 rooms, the increased license fee would mean an expense of $5000 a year, Goodis said.
Testifies at hearing his testimony came during a hearing on a bill raising fees for a wide variety of licenses, permits and city services.
The new fees are expected to raise an additional $740,000 in the remainder of 1961 and $2,330,000 more a year after that.
The ordinance would increase the fee for rooming houses, hotels and multi-family dwellings to $5 a room.
The cost of a license now is $2, with an annual renewal fee of $1.
Goodis said that single rooms account for 95 percent of the accomodations in some hotels.
Revenue estimated the city expects the higher rooming house, hotel and apartment house fees to bring in an additional $457,000 a year.
The increase also was opposed by Leonard Kaplan, spokesman for the Home Builders Association of Philadelphia, on behalf of association members who operate apartment houses.
A proposal to raise dog license fees drew an objection from Councilwoman Virginia Knauer, who formerly raised pedigreed dogs.
The ordinance would increase fees from $1 for males and $2 for females to a flat $5 a dog.
Commissioner replies Mrs. Knauer said she did not think dog owners should be penalized for the city's services to animal care.
In reply, Deputy Police Commissioner Howard R. Leary said that the city spends more than $115,000 annually to license and regulate dogs but collects only $43,000 in fees.
He reported that the city's contributions for animal care included $67,000 to the Women's S.*p.*c.*a. ; $15,000 to pay six policemen assigned as dog catchers and $15,000 to investigate dog bites.
Backs higher fees city Finance Director Richard J. Mc*connell indorsed the higher fees, which, he said, had been under study for more than a year.
The city is not adequately compensated for the services covered by the fees, he said.
The new fee schedule also was supported by Commissioner of Licenses and Inspections Barnet Lieberman and Health Commissioner Eugene A. Gillis.
Petitions asking for a jail term for Norristown attorney Julian W. Barnard will be presented to the Montgomery County Court Friday, it was disclosed Tuesday by Horace A. Davenport, counsel for the widow of the man killed last Nov. 1 by Barnard's hit-run car.
The petitions will be presented in open court to President Judge William F. Dannehower, Davenport said.
Barnard, who pleaded no defense to manslaughter and hit-run charges, was fined $500 by Judge Warren K. Hess, and placed on two years' probation providing he does not drive during that time.
He was caught driving the day after the sentence was pronounced and given a warning.
Victim of the accident was Robert Lee Stansbery, 39.
His widow started the circulation of petitions after Barnard was reprimanded for violating the probation.
The City Planning Commission on Tuesday approved agreements between two redevelopers and the Redevelopment Authority for the purchase of land in the $300,000,000 Eastwick Redevelopment Area project.
The commission also approved a novel plan that would eliminate traffic hazards for pedestrians in the project.
One of the agreements calls for the New Eastwick Corp. to purchase a 1311 acre tract for $12,192,865.
The tract is bounded by Island Ave., Dicks Ave., 61st St., and Eastwick Ave..
Four parks planned it is designated as Stage 1 Residential on the Redevelopment Authority's master plan and will feature row houses, garden apartments, four small parks, schools, churches, a shopping center and several small clusters of stores.
The corporation was formed by the Reynolds Metal Co. and the Samuel A. and Henry A. Berger firm, a Philadelphia builder, for work in the project.
The second agreement permits the authority to sell a 520-acre tract west of Stage 1 Residential to Philadelphia Builders Eastwick Corp., a firm composed of 10 Philadelphia area builders, which is interested in developing part of the project.
Would bar vehicles the plan for eliminating traffic hazards for pedestrians was developed by Dr. Constantinos A. Doxiadis, former Minister of Reconstruction in Greece and a consulting planner for the New Eastwick Corp..
The plan calls for dividing the project into 16 sectors which would be barred to vehicular traffic.
It provides for a series of landscaped walkways and a central esplanade that would eventually run through the center of the entire two-and-a-half-mile length of the project.
The esplanade eliminates Grovers Ave., which on original plans ran through the center of the development.
The esplanade would feature pedestrian bridges over roads in the project.
Kansas City, Mo., Feb. 9 ( U*p*i ) -- the president of the Kansas City local of the International Association of Fire Fighters was severly injured today when a bomb tore his car apart as he left home for work.
Battalion Chief Stanton M. Gladden, 42, the central figure in a representation dispute between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union, suffered multiple fractures of both ankles.
He was in Baptist Memorial hospital.
Ignition sets off blast the battalion chief said he had just gotten into his 1958 model automobile to move it from the driveway of his home so that he could take his other car to work.
I'd just turned on the ignition when there was a big flash and I was lying on the driveway, he said.
Gladden's wife and two of his sons, John, 17, and Jim, 13, were inside the house.
The younger boy said the blast knocked him out of bed and against the wall.
Hood flies over house the explosion sent the hood of the car flying over the roof of the house.
The left front wheel landed 100 feet away.
Police laboratory technicians said the explosive device, containing either *j or nitroglycerine, was apparently placed under the left front wheel.
It was first believed the bomb was rigged to the car's starter.
Gladden had been the target of threatening telephone calls in recent months and reportedly received one last night.
The fire department here has been torn for months by dissension involving top personnel and the fight between the fire fighters association and the teamsters union.
Led fight on teamsters Gladden has been an outspoken critic of the present city administration and led his union's battle against the teamsters, which began organizing city firemen in 1959.
The fire fighters association here offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the person or persons responsible for the bombing.
A $500 reward was offered by the association's local in Kansas City, Kas..
The association said it would post 24 hour guards at Gladden's home and at those of James Mining and Eugene Shiflett.
Mining is secretary-treasurer of the local and Shiflett is a member of its executive committee.
Both have been active in the association.
Ankara, Turkey, Oct. 24 ( A*p ) -- Turkish political leaders bowed today to military pressure and agreed to form an emergency national front government with Gen. Cemal Gursel as president.
An agreement between the leaders of four parties which contested indecisive elections on Oct. 15 was reached after almost 18 hours of political bargaining under the threat of an army coup d'etat.
By-passing the military junta which has ruled Turkey since the overthrow of Premier Adnan Menderes 17 months ago, the army general staff, led by Gen. Cedvet Sunay, had set a deadline for the parties to join in a national coalition government.
The army leaders threatened to form a new military government if the parties failed to sign an eight point protocol agreeing on Gen. Gursel as president.
Gen. Gursel has headed the military junta the last 17 months.
The military also had demanded pledges that there would be no changes in the laws passed by the junta and no leaders of the Menderes regime now in prison would be pardoned.
Party leaders came out of the final meeting apparently satisfied and stated that complete agreement had been reached on a solution to the crisis created by the elections which left no party with enough strength to form a government on its own.
Vincent G. Ierulli has been appointed temporary assistant district attorney, it was announced Monday by Charles E. Raymond, District Attorney.
Ierulli will replace Desmond D. Connall who has been called to active military service but is expected back on the job by March 31.
Ierulli, 29, has been practicing in Portland since November, 1959.
He is a graduate of Portland University and the Northwestern College of Law.
He is married and the father of three children.
Helping foreign countries to build a sound political structure is more important than aiding them economically, E. M. Martin, assistant secretary of state for economic affairs told members of the World Affairs Council Monday night.
Martin, who has been in office in Washington, D. C., for 13 months spoke at the council's annual meeting at the Multnomah Hotel.
He told some 350 persons that the United States' challenge was to help countries build their own societies their own ways, following their own paths.
We must persuade them to enjoy a way of life which, if not identical, is congenial with ours, he said but adding that if they do not develop the kind of society they themselves want it will lack ritiuality and loyalty.
Patience needed insuring that the countries have a freedom of choice, he said, was the biggest detriment to the Soviet Union.
He cited East Germany where after 15 years of Soviet rule it has become necessary to build a wall to keep the people in, and added, so long as people rebel, we must not give up.
Martin called for patience on the part of Americans.
The countries are trying to build in a decade the kind of society we took a century to build, he said.
By leaving our doors open the United States gives other peoples the opportunity to see us and to compare, he said.
Individual help best we have no reason to fear failure, but we must be extraordinarily patient, the assistant secretary said.
Economically, Martin said, the United States could best help foreign countries by helping them help themselves.
Private business is more effective than government aid, he explained, because individuals are able to work with the people themselves.
The United States must plan to absorb the exported goods of the country, at what he termed a social cost.
Martin said the government has been working to establish firmer prices on primary products which may involve the total income of one country.
The Portland school board was asked Monday to take a positive stand towards developing and coordinating with Portland's civil defense more plans for the city's schools in event of attack.
But there seemed to be some difference of opinion as to how far the board should go, and whose advice it should follow.
The board members, after hearing the coordination plea from Mrs. Ralph H. Molvar, 1409 *j Maplecrest Dr., said they thought they had already been cooperating.
Chairman C. Richard Mears pointed out that perhaps this was not strictly a school board problem, in case of atomic attack, but that the board would cooperate so far as possible to get the children to where the parents wanted them to go.
Dr. Melvin W. Barnes, superintendent, said he thought the schools were waiting for some leadership, perhaps on the national level, to make sure that whatever steps of planning they took would be more fruitful, and that he had found that other school districts were not as far along in their planning as this district.
Los Angeles has said they would send the children to their homes in case of disaster, he said.
Nobody really expects to evacuate.
I think everybody is agreed that we need to hear some voice on the national level that would make some sense and in which we would have some confidence in following.
Mrs. Molvar, who kept reiterating her request that they please take a stand, said, we must have faith in somebody -- on the local level, and it wouldn't be possible for everyone to rush to a school to get their children.
Dr. Barnes said that there seemed to be feeling that evacuation plans, even for a high school where there were lots of cars might not be realistic and would not work.
Mrs. Molvar asked again that the board join in taking a stand in keeping with Jack Lowe's program.
The board said it thought it had gone as far as instructed so far and asked for more information to be brought at the next meeting.
It was generally agreed that the subject was important and the board should be informed on what was done, is going to be done and what it thought should be done.
Salem ( A*p ) -- the statewide meeting of war mothers Tuesday in Salem will hear a greeting from Gov. Mark Hatfield.
Hatfield also is scheduled to hold a public United Nations Day reception in the state capitol on Tuesday.
His schedule calls for a noon speech Monday in Eugene at the Emerald Empire Kiwanis Club.
He will speak to Willamette University Young Republicans Thursday night in Salem.
On Friday he will go to Portland for the swearing in of Dean Bryson as Multnomah County Circuit Judge.
He will attend a meeting of the Republican State Central Committee Saturday in Portland and see the Washington-*oregon football game.
Beaverton School District No. 48 board members examined blueprints and specifications for two proposed junior high schools at a Monday night workshop session.
A bond issue which would have provided some $3.5 million for construction of the two 900-student schools was defeated by district voters in January.
Last week the board, by a 4 to 3 vote, decided to ask voters whether they prefer the 6-3-3 ( junior high school ) system or the 8-4 system.
Board members indicated Monday night this would be done by an advisory poll to be taken on Nov. 15, the same date as a $581,000 bond election for the construction of three new elementary schools.
Secretary of Labor Arthur Goldberg will speak Sunday night at the Masonic Temple at a $25-a-plate dinner honoring Sen. Wayne L. Morse, *j.
The dinner is sponsored by organized labor and is scheduled for 7 p.m..
Secretary Goldberg and Sen. Morse will hold a joint press conference at the Roosevelt Hotel at 4:30 p.m. Sunday, Blaine Whipple, executive secretary of the Democratic Party of Oregon, reported Tuesday.
Other speakers for the fund-raising dinner include Reps. Edith Green and Al Ullman, Labor Commissioner Norman Nilsen and Mayor Terry Schrunk, all Democrats.
Oak Grove ( special ) -- three positions on the Oak Lodge Water district board of directors have attracted 11 candidates.
The election will be Dec. 4 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m..
Polls will be in the water office.
Incumbent Richard Salter seeks re-election and is opposed by Donald Huffman for the five-year term.
Incumbent William Brod is opposed in his re-election bid by Barbara Njust, Miles C. Bubenik and Frank Lee.
Five candidates seek the place vacated by Secretary Hugh G. Stout.
Seeking this two-year term are James Culbertson, Dwight M. Steeves, James C. Piersee, W.*m. Sexton and Theodore W. Heitschmidt.
A stronger stand on their beliefs and a firmer grasp on their future were taken Friday by delegates to the 29th general council of the Assemblies of God, in session at the Memorial Coliseum.
The council revised, in an effort to strengthen, the denomination's 16 basic beliefs adopted in 1966.
The changes, unanimously adopted, were felt necessary in the face of modern trends away from the Bible.
The council agreed it should more firmly state its belief in and dependence on the Bible.
At the adoption, the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman, general superintendent, commented, The Assemblies of God has been a bulwark for fundamentalism in these modern days and has, without compromise, stood for the great truths of the Bible for which men in the past have been willing to give their lives.
New point added many changes involved minor editing and clarification ; however, the first belief stood for entire revision with a new third point added to the list.
The first of 16 beliefs of the denomination, now reads : the scriptures, both Old and New Testament, are verbally inspired of God and are the revelation of God to man, the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct.
The third belief, in six points, emphasizes the Diety of the Lord Jesus Christ, and : -- emphasizes the Virgin birth -- the sinless life of Christ -- his miracles -- his substitutionary work on the cross -- his bodily resurrection from the dead -- and His exaltation to the right hand of God.
Super again elected Friday afternoon the Rev. T. F. Zimmerman was reelected for his second consecutive two-year term as general superintendent of Assemblies of God.
His offices are in Springfield, Mo..
Election came on the nominating ballot.
Friday night the delegates heard the need for their forthcoming program, Breakthrough scheduled to fill the churches for the next two years.
In his opening address Wednesday the Rev. Mr. Zimmerman, urged the delegates to consider a 10-year expansion program, with Breakthrough the theme for the first two years.
The Rev. R. L. Brandt, national secretary of the home missions department, stressed the need for the first two years' work.
Surveys show that one out of three Americans has vital contact with the church.
This means that more than 100 million have no vital touch with the church or religious life, he told delegates Friday.
Church loses pace talking of the rapid population growth ( upwards of 12,000 babies born daily ) with an immigrant entering the United States every 1-1/2 minutes, he said our organization has not been keeping pace with this challenge.
In 35 years we have opened 7,000 churches, the Rev. Mr. Brandt said, adding that the denomination had a national goal of one church for every 10,000 persons.
In this light we need 1,000 churches in Illinois, where we have 200 ; 800 in Southern New England, we have 60 ; we need 100 in Rhode Island, we have none, he said.
To step up the denomination's program, the Rev. Mr. Brandt suggested the vision of 8,000 new Assemblies of God churches in the next 10 years.
To accomplish this would necessitate some changes in methods, he said.
Church meets change the church's ability to change her methods is going to determine her ability to meet the challenge of this hour.
A capsule view of proposed plans includes : -- encouraging by every means, all existing Assemblies of God churches to start new churches.
-- engaging mature, experienced men to pioneer or open new churches in strategic population centers.
-- surrounding pioneer pastors with vocational volunteers ( laymen, who will be urged to move into the area of new churches in the interest of lending their support to the new project ).
-- arranging for ministerial graduates to spend from 6-12 months as apprentices in well-established churches.
U.*s. Dist. Judge Charles L. Powell denied all motions made by defense attorneys Monday in Portland's insurance fraud trial.
Denials were of motions of dismissal, continuance, mistrial, separate trial, acquittal, striking of testimony and directed verdict.
In denying motions for dismissal, Judge Powell stated that mass trials have been upheld as proper in other courts and that a person may join a conspiracy without knowing who all of the conspirators are.
Attorney Dwight L. Schwab, in behalf of defendant Philip Weinstein, argued there is no evidence linking Weinstein to the conspiracy, but Judge Powell declared this is a matter for the jury to decide.
Proof lack charged Schwab also declared there is no proof of Weinstein's entering a conspiracy to use the U.*s. mails to defraud, to which federal prosecutor A. Lawrence Burbank replied : it is not necessary that a defendant actually have conpired to use the U.*s. mails to defraud as long as there is evidence of a conspiracy, and the mails were then used to carry it out.
In the afternoon, defense attorneys began the presentation of their cases with opening statements, some of which had been deferred until after the government had called witnesses and presented its case.
Miami, Fla., March 17 -- the Orioles tonight retained the distinction of being the only winless team among the eighteen Major-*league clubs as they dropped their sixth straight spring exhibition decision, this one to the Kansas City Athletics by a score of 5 to 3.
Indications as late as the top of the sixth were that the Birds were to end their victory draught as they coasted along with a 3-to-o advantage.
Siebern hits homer over the first five frames, Jack Fisher, the big righthander who figures to be in the middle of Oriole plans for a drive on the 1961 American League pennant, held the *j scoreless while yielding three scattered hits.
Then Dick Hyde, submarine-ball hurler, entered the contest and only five batters needed to face him before there existed a 3-to-3 deadlock.
A two-run homer by Norm Siebern and a solo blast by Bill Tuttle tied the game, and single runs in the eighth and ninth gave the Athletics their fifth victory in eight starts.
House throws wild with one down in the eighth, Marv Throneberry drew a walk and stole second as Hyde fanned Tuttle.
Catcher Frank House's throw in an effort to nab Throneberry was wide and in the dirt.
Then Heywood Sullivan, Kansas City catcher, singled up the middle and Throneberry was across with what proved to be the winning run.
Rookie southpaw George Stepanovich relieved Hyde at the start of the ninth and gave up the *j fifth tally on a walk to second baseman Dick Howser, a wild pitch, and Frank Cipriani's single under Shortstop Jerry Adair's glove into center.
The Orioles once again performed at the plate in powderpuff fashion, gathering only seven blows off the offerings of three Kansas City pitchers.
Three were doubles, Brooks Robinson getting a pair and Marv Breeding one.
Hartman impressive Bill Kunkel, Bob Hartman and Ed Keegan did the mound chores for the club down from West Palm Beach to play the game before 767 paying customers in Miami Stadium.
The Birds got five hits and all three of their runs off Kunkel before Hartman took over in the top of the fourth.
Hartman, purchased by the *j from the Milwaukee Braves last fall, allowed no hits in his scoreless three-inning appearance, and merited the triumph.
Keegan, a 6-foot-3-inch 158-pounder, gave up the Orioles' last two safeties over the final three frames, escaping a load of trouble in the ninth when the Birds threatened but failed to tally.
Robinson doubles again in the ninth, Robinson led off with his second double of the night, a blast off the fence 375 feet deep into left.
Whitey Herzog, performing in right as the Orioles fielded possibly their strongest team of the spring, worked Keegan for a base on balls.
Then three consecutive pinch-hitters failed to produce.
Pete Ward was sent in for House and, after failing in a bunt attempt, popped to Howser on the grass back of short.
John Powell, batting for Adair, fanned after fouling off two 2-and-2 pitches, and Buddy Barker, up for Stepanovich, bounced out sharply to Jerry Lumpe at second to end the 2-hour-and-27-minute contest.
The Orioles got a run in the first inning when Breeding, along with Robinson, the two Birds who got a pair of hits, doubled to right center, moved to third on Russ Snyder's single to right and crossed on Kunkel's wild pitch into the dirt in front of the plate.
The Flock added a pair of tallies in the third on three straight hits after two were out.
Jackie Brandt singled deep into the hole at short to start the rally.
Lumpe errs Jim Gentile bounced a hard shot off Kunkel's glove and beat it out for a single, and when Lumpe grabbed the ball and threw it over first baseman Throneberry's head Brandt took third and Gentile second on the error.
Then Robinson slammed a long double to left center to score both runners.
When Robinson tried to stretch his blow into a triple, he was cut down in a close play at third, Tuttle to Andy Carey.
The detailed rundown on the Kansas City scoring in the sixth went like this : Lumpe worked a walk as the first batter to face Hyde and romped around as Siebern blasted Hyde's next toss 415 feet over the scoreboard in right center.
Carey singles Carey singled on a slow-bouncing ball to short which Robinson cut across to field and threw wide to first.
It was ruled a difficult chance and a hit.
Then Throneberry rapped into a fast double play.
Breeding to Adair to Gentile, setting up Tuttle's 390-foot homer over the wall in left center.
If the Orioles are to break their losing streak within the next two days, it will have to be at the expense of the American League champion New York Yankees, who come in here tomorrow for a night game and a single test Sunday afternoon.
Miami, Fla., March 17 -- the flavor of Baltimore's Florida Grapefruit League news ripened considerably late today when the Orioles were advised that Ron Hansen has fulfilled his obligations under the Army's military training program and is ready for belated spring training.
Hansen, who slugged the 1960 Oriole high of 22 homers and drove in 86 runs on a.255
Freshman average, completes the Birds' spring squad at 49 players.
The big, 22-year-old shortstop, the 1960 American league rookie-of-the-year, flew here late this afternoon from Baltimore, signed his contract for an estimated $15,000 and was a spectator at tonight's 5-to-3 loss to Kansas City -- the winless Birds' sixth setback in a row.
15 pounds lighter the 6-foot 3-inch Hansen checked in close to 200 pounds, 15 pounds lighter than his reporting weight last spring.
He hopes to melt off an additional eight pounds before the Flock breaks camp three weeks hence.
When he was inducted into the Army at Fort Knox, Ky., Hansen's weight had dropped to 180 -- too light for me to be at my best he said.
I feel good physically, Hansen added, but I think I'll move better carrying a little less weight than I'm carrying now.
Seeks improved fielding the rangy, Albany ( Cal. ) native, a surprise slugging sensation for the Flock last year as well as a defensive whiz, set improved fielding as his 1961 goal.
I think I can do a better job with the glove, now that I know the hitters around the league a little better, he said.
Hansen will engage in his first workout at Miami Stadium prior to the opening tomorrow night of a two-game weekend series with the New York Yankees.
Skinny Brown and Hoyt Wilhelm, the Flock's veteran knuckleball specialists, are slated to oppose the American League champions in tomorrow's 8 P.*m. contest.
Duren, Sheldon on hill Ryne Duren and Roland Sheldon, a rookie righthander who posted a 15-1 record last year for the Yanks' Auburn ( N.*y. ) farm club of the Class-*d New York-*pennsylvania League, are the probable rival pitchers.
Twenty-one-year-old Milt Pappas and Jerry Walker, 22, are scheduled to share the Oriole mound chores against the Bombers' Art Ditmar in Sunday's 2 P.*m. encounter.
Ralph Houk, successor to Casey Stengel at the Yankee helm, plans to bring the entire New York squad here from St. Petersburg, including Joe Dimaggio and large crowds are anticipated for both weekend games.
The famed Yankee Clipper, now retired, has been assisting as a batting coach.
Squad cut near pitcher Steve Barber joined the club one week ago after completing his hitch under the Army's accelerated wintertime military course, also at Fort Knox, Ky..
The 22-year-old southpaw enlisted earlier last fall than did Hansen.
Baltimore's bulky spring-training contingent now gradually will be reduced as Manager Paul Richards and his coaches seek to trim it down to a more streamlined and workable unit.
Take a ride on this one, Brooks Robinson greeted Hansen as the Bird third sacker grabbed a bat, headed for the plate and bounced a third-inning two-run double off the left-centerfield wall tonight.
It was the first of two doubles by Robinson, who was in a mood to celebrate.
Just before game time, Robinson's pretty wife, Connie informed him that an addition to the family can be expected late next summer.
Unfortunately, Brooks's teammates were not in such festive mood as the Orioles expired before the seven-hit pitching of three Kansas City rookie hurlers.
Hansen arrived just before nightfall, two hours late, in company with Lee Mac*phail ; J. A. W. Iglehart, chairman of the Oriole board of directors, and Public Relations Director Jack Dunn.
Their flight was delayed, Dunn said, when a boarding ramp inflicted some minor damage to the wing of the plane.
Ex-*oriole Clint Courtney, now catching for the *j is all for the American League's 1961 expansion to the West Coast.
But they shouldda brought in Tokyo, too, added Old Scrapiron.
Then we'd really have someplace to go.
Bowie, Md., March 17 -- gaining her second straight victory, Norman B., Small, Jr.'s Garden Fresh, a 3-year-old filly, downed promising colts in the $4,500 St. Patrick's Day Purse, featured seventh race here today, and paid $7.20 straight.
Toying with her field in the early stages, Garden Fresh was asked for top speed only in the stretch by Jockey Philip Grimm and won by a length and a half in 1.24 3-5 for the 7 furlongs.
8,280 attend races Richard M. Forbes's Paget, which had what seemed to be a substantial lead in the early stages, tired rapidly nearing the wire and was able to save place money only a head in front of Glen T. Hallowell's Milties Miss.
A bright sun and brisk wind had the track in a fast condition for the first time this week and 8,280 St. Patty Day celebrants bet $842,617 on the well-prepared program.
Prior to the featured race, the stewards announced that apprentice James P. Verrone is suspended ten days for crowding horses and crossing the field sharply in two races on Wednesday.
Culmone gets first win Garden Fresh, the result of a mating of Better Self and Rosy Fingered, seems to improve with each start and appeared to win the St. Patrick's Day Purse with some speed in reserve.
She was moving up to the allowance department after winning a $10,000 claiming event.
Cleveland, March 17 ( A*p ) -- George Kerr, the swift-striding Jamaican, set a meet record in the 600-yard run in the Knights of Columbus track meet tonight, beating Purdue's Dave Mills in a hot duel in 1.10.1.
Kerr, who set the world record earlier this month in New York with a clocking of 1.09.3, wiped out Mills's early pace and beat the young Big 10 quarter-mile king by 5 yards.
Both were under the meet mark of 1.10.8 set in 1950 by Mal Whitfield.
Mills shot out in front and kept the lead through two thirds of the race.
Then Kerr, a graduate student from Illinois, moved past him on a straightaway and held off Mills's challenge on the final turn.
Mills was timed in 1.10.4.
The crowd at the twenty-first annual K. of C. Games, final indoor meet of the season, got a thrill a few minutes earlier when a slender, bespectacled woman broke the one-week-old world record in the half-mile run.
Mrs. Grace Butcher, of nearby Chardon, a 27-year-old housewife who has two children, finished in 2.21.6.
She snapped five tenths of a second off the mark set by Helen Shipley, of Wellsley College, in the National A.*a.*u. meet in Columbus, Ohio.
San Francisco, March 17 ( A*p ) -- Bobby Waters of Sylvania, Ga., relief quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League, will undergo a knee operation tomorrow at Franklin Hospital here.
Waters injured his left knee in the last game of the 1960 season.
While working out in Sylvania a swelling developed in the knee and he came here to consult the team physician.
St. Petersburg, Fla., March 17 ( A*p ) -- two errors by New York Yankee shortstop Tony Kubek in the eleventh inning donated four unearned runs and a 5-to-2 victory to the Chicago White Sox today.
Austin, Texas -- a Texas halfback who doesn't even know the team's plays, Eldon Moritz, ranks fourth in Southwest Conference scoring after three games.
Time stands still every time Moritz, a 26-year-old Army Signal Corps veteran, goes into the field.
Although he never gets to play while the clock is running, he gets a big kick -- several every Saturday, in fact -- out of football.
Moritz doesn't even have a nose guard or hip pads but he's one of the most valuable members of the Longhorn team that will be heavily favored Saturday over Oklahoma in the Cotton Bowl.
That's because he already has kicked 14 extra points in 15 tries.
He ran his string of successful conversions this season to 13 straight before one went astray last Saturday night in the 41-8 slaughter of Washington State.
Moritz is listed on the Longhorn roster as a right halfback, the position at which he lettered on the 1956 team.
But ask coach Darrell Royal what position he plays and you'll get the quick response, place-kicker.
A 208-pound, 6-foot 1-inch senior from Stamford, Moritz practices nothing but place-kicking.
Last year, when he worked out at halfback all season, he didn't get into a single game.
This year, coach Royal told me if I'd work on my place-kicking he thought he could use me, said Moritz.
So I started practicing on it in spring training.
Moritz was bothered during the first two games this year by a pulled muscle in the thigh of his right ( kicking ) leg and, as a result, several of his successful conversions have gone barely far enough.
Moritz said Monday his leg feels fine and, as a result, he hopes to start practicing field goals this week.
He kicked several while playing at Stamford High School, including one that beat Anson, 3-0, in a 1953 district game.
I kicked about 110 extra points in 135 tries during three years in high school, he said, and made 26 in a row at one time.
I never did miss one in a playoff game -- I kicked about 20 in the five playoff games my last two years.
Moritz came to Texas in 1954 but his freshman football efforts were hampered by a knee injury.
He missed the 1955 season because of an operation on the ailing knee, then played 77 minutes in 1956.
His statistical record that year, when Texas won only one game and lost nine, was far from impressive : he carried the ball three times for a net gain of 10 yards, punted once for 39 yards and caught one pass for 13 yards.
He went into the Army in March, 1957, and returned two years later.
But he was scholastically ineligible in 1959 and merely present last season.
Place kicking is largely a matter of timing, Moritz declared.
Once you get the feel of it, there's not much to it.
I've tried to teach some of the other boys to kick and some of them can't seem to get the feel.
Practice helps you to get your timing down.
It's kind of like golf -- if you don't swing a club very often, your timing gets off.
Moritz, however, kicks only about 10 or 12 extra points during each practice session.
If you kick too much, your leg gets kinda dead, he explained.
Footnotes : in their first three games, the Longhorns have had the ball 41 times and scored 16 times, or 40 per cent ; their total passing yardage in three games, 447 on 30 completions in 56 attempts, is only 22 yards short of their total passing yardage in 1959, when they made 469 on 37 completions in 86 tries.
Tailback James Saxton already has surpassed his rushing total for his brilliant sophomore season, when he netted 271 yards on 55 carries ; he now has 273 yards in 22 tries during three games.
Saxton has made only one second-half appearance this season and that was in the Washington State game, for four plays : he returned the kickoff 30 yards, gained five yards through the line and then uncorked a 56-yard touchdown run before retiring to the bench.
Wingback Jack Collins injured a knee in the Washington State game but insists he'll be ready for Oklahoma.
Last week, when Royal was informed that three Longhorns were among the conference's top four in rushing, he said : that won't last long.
It didn't ; Monday, he had four Longhorns in the top four.
A good feeling prevailed on the *j coaching staff Monday, but attention quickly turned from Saturday's victory to next week's problem : Rice University.
The Mustangs don't play this week.
We're just real happy for the players, Coach Bill Meek said of the 9-7 victory over the Air Force Academy.
I think the big thing about the game was that our kids for the third straight week stayed in there pitching and kept the pressure on.
It was the first time we've been ahead this season ( when John Richey kicked what proved to be the winning field goal ).
Assistant coach John Cudmore described victory as a good feeling, I think, on the part of the coaches and the players.
We needed it and we got it.
Meek expressed particular gratification at the defensive performances of end Happy Nelson and halfback Billy Gannon.
Both turned in top jobs for the second straight game.
Nelson played magnificent football, Meek praised.
He knocked down the interference and made key stops lots of times.
And he caused the fumble that set up our touchdown.
He broke that boy ( Air Force fullback Nick Arshinkoff ) in two and knocked him loose from the football.
Gannon contributed saving plays on the Falcons' aerial thrusts in the late stages.
One was on a fourth-down screen pass from the Mustang 21 after an incomplete pass into Gannon's territory.
As soon as it started to form, Gannon spotted it, Meek said.
He timed it just right and broke through there before the boy ( halfback Terry Isaacson ) had time to turn around.
He really crucified him he nailed it for a yard loss.
The Air Force's, and the game's, final play, was a long pass by quarterback Bob Mc*naughton which Gannon intercepted on his own 44 and returned 22 yards.
He just lay back there and waited for it, Meek said.
He almost brought it back all the way.
Except for sophomore center Mike Kelsey and fullback Mike Rice, Meek expects the squad to be physically sound for Rice.
Kelsey is very doubtful for the Rice game, Meek said.
He'll be out of action all this week.
He got hit from the blind side by the split end coming back on the second play of the game.
There is definitely some ligament damage in his knee.
Rice has not played since injuring a knee in the opener with Maryland.
He's looking a lot better, and he's able to run, Meek explained.
We'll let him do a lot of running this week, but I don't know if he'll be able to play.
The game players saw the Air Force film Monday, ran for 30 minutes, then went in, while the reserves scrimmaged for 45 minutes.
We'll work hard Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, Meek said, and probably will have a good scrimmage Friday.
We'll work out about an hour on Saturday, then we'll work Monday and Tuesday of next week, then taper off.
*j S*m*u will play the Owls at Rice Stadium in Houston in a night game Saturday, Oct. 21.
Huddle hearsay -- held out of Texas Tech's sweat-suits drill Monday at Lubbock was tackle Richard Stafford, who is undergoing treatment for a leg injury suffered in the Raiders' 38-7 loss to Texas *j & *j because of its important game with Arkansas coming up Saturday, Baylor worked out in the rain Monday -- mud or no mud.
End Gene Raesz, who broke a hand in the Owl's game with *j, was back working out with Rice Monday, and John Nichols, sophomore guard, moved back into action after a week's idleness with an ankle injury.
The Texas Aggies got a day off Monday -- a special gift from Coach Jim Myers for its conference victory last Saturday night, but Myers announced that halfback George Hargett, shaken up in the Tech game, would not play against Trinity Saturday.
Halfback Bud Priddy, slowed for almost a month by a slowly-mending sprained ankle, joined *j T*c*u's workout Monday.
The Dallas Texans were back home Monday with their third victory in four American Football League starts -- a 19-12 triumph over the Denver Broncos -- but their visit will be a short one.
The Texans have two more road games -- at Buffalo and Houston -- before they play for the home folks again, and it looks as if coach Hank Stram's men will meet the Bills just as they are developing into the kind of team they were expected to be in pre-season reckonings.
Buffalo coach Buster Ramsey, who has become one of the game's greatest collectors of quarterbacks, apparently now has found a productive pair in two ex-*national Football Leaguers, M. C. Reynolds and Warren Rabb.
Rabb, the former Louisiana State field general, came off the bench for his debut with the Bills Sunday and directed his new team to a 22-12 upset victory over the Houston Oilers, defending league champions.
Just our luck ] exclaimed Stram.
Buster would solve that quarterback problem just as we head that way.
Ramsey has a thing or two to mutter about himself, for the Dallas defensive unit turned in another splendid effort against Denver, and the Texans were able to whip the dangerous Broncs without the fullbacking of a top star, Jack Spikes, though he did the team's place-kicking while nursing a knee injury.
Our interior line and out linebackers played exceptionally well, said Stram Monday after he and his staff reviewed movies of the game.
In fact our whole defensive unit did a good job.
The Texans won the game through ball control, with Quarterback Cotton Davidson throwing only 17 passes.
We always like to keep the ball as much as we can against Denver because they have such an explosive attack, explained Stram.
They can be going along, doing little damage, then bang, bang -- they can hit a couple of passes on you for touchdowns and put you in trouble.
The Broncs did hit two quick strikes in the final period against the Texans, but Dallas had enough of a lead to hold them off.
The principal tactic in controlling the ball was giving it to Abner Haynes, the flashy halfback.
He was called upon 26 times -- more than all of the other ball-carriers combined -- and delivered 145 yards.
The Texans made themselves a comforting break on the opening kickoff when Denver's Al Carmichael was jarred loose from the ball when Dave Grayson, the speedy halfback, hit him and Guard Al Reynolds claimed it for Dallas.
A quick touchdown resulted.
That permitted us to start controlling the ball right away, said Stram, quipping, I think I'll put that play in the book.
The early Southwest Conference football leaders -- Texas, Arkansas and Texas *j & *j -- made a big dent in the statistics last week.
Texas' 545-yard spree against Washington State gave the Longhorns a 3-game total offense of 1,512 yards ( 1,065 rushing and 447 passing ) a new *j high.
Arkansas combined 280 yards rushing with 64 yards passing ( on 5 completions in 7 tosses ) and a tough defense to whip *j, and *j & *j, with a 38-point bulge against Texas Tech ran up its biggest total loop play since 1950.
Completing 12 of 15 passes for 174 yards, the Aggies had a total offense of 361 yards.
Texas leads in per-game rushing averages, 355 yards, and passing 149 ( to Baylor's 126 ), but idle Baylor has the best defensive record ( 187.5 yards per game to Texas' 189 ).
*j & *j has the best defense against passes, 34.7 yards per game.
Not satisfied with various unofficial checks on the liveliness of baseballs currently in use, the major leagues have ordered their own tests, which are in progress at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Rookie Ron Nischwitz continued his pinpoint pitching Monday night as the Bears made it two straight over Indianapolis, 5-3.
The husky 6-3, 205-pound lefthander, was in command all the way before an on-the-scene audience of only 949 and countless of television viewers in the Denver area.
It was Nischwitz' third straight victory of the new season and ran the Grizzlies' winning streak to four straight.
They now lead Louisville by a full game on top of the American Association pack.
Nischwitz fanned six and walked only Charley Hinton in the third inning.
He has given only the one pass in his 27 innings, an unusual characteristic for a southpaw.
The Bears took the lead in the first inning, as they did in Sunday's opener, and never lagged.
Dick Mc*auliffe cracked the first of his two doubles against Lefty Don Rudolph to open the Bear's attack.
After Al Paschal gruonded out, Jay Cooke walked and Jim Mc*daniel singled home Mc*auliffe.
Alusik then moved Cooke across with a line drive to left.
Jay Porter drew a base on balls to fill the bases but Don Wert's smash was knocked down by Rudolph for the putout.
The Bears added two more in the fifth when Mc*auliffe dropped a double into the leftfield corner, Paschal doubled down the rightfield line and Cooke singled off Phil Shartzer's glove.
Nischwitz was working on a 3-hitter when the Indians bunched three of their eight hits for two runs in the sixth.
Chuck Hinton tripled to the rightfield corner, Cliff Cook and Dan Pavletich singled and Gaines' infield roller accounted for the tallies.
The Bears added their last run in the sixth on Alusik's double and outfield flies by Porter and Wert.
Gaines hammered the ball over the left fence for the third Indianapolis run in the ninth.
Despite the 45-degree weather the game was clicked off in 1:48, thanks to only three bases on balls and some good infield play.
Chico Ruiz made a spectacular play on Alusik's grounder in the hole in the fourth and Wert came up with some good stops and showed a strong arm at third base.
Bingles and bobbles : Cliff Cook accounted for three of the Tribe's eight hits.
It was the season's first night game and an obvious refocusing of the lights are in order.
The infield was well flooded but the expanded outfield was much too dark.
Mary Dobbs Tuttle was back at the organ.
Among the spectators was the noted exotic dancer, Patti Waggin who is Mrs. Don Rudolph when off the stage.
Lefty Wyman Carey, another Denver rookie, will be on the mound against veteran John Tsitouris at 8 o'clock Tuesday night.
Ed Donnelly is still bothered by a side injury and will miss his starting turn.
Dallas, Tex., May 1 -- ( A*p ) -- Kenny Lane of Muskegon, Mich., world's seventh ranked lightweight, had little trouble in taking a unanimous decision over Rip Randall of Tyler, Tex., here Monday night.
St. Paul-*minneapolis, May 1 -- ( A*p ) -- Billy Gardner's line double, which just eluded the diving Minnie Minoso in left field, drove in Jim Lemon with the winning run with two out in the last of the ninth to give the Minnesota Twins a 6-5 victory over the Chicago White Sox Monday.
Lemon was on with his fourth single of the game, a liner to center.
He came all the way around on Gardner's hit before 5777 fans.
It was Gardner's second run batted in of the game and his only ones of the year.
Turk Lown was tagged with the loss, his second against no victories, while Ray Moore won his second game against a single loss.
The Twins tied the score in the sixth inning when Reno Bertoia beat out a high chopper to third base and scored on Lenny Green's double to left.
The White Sox had taken a 5-4 lead in the top of the sixth on a pair of pop fly hits -- a triple by Roy Sievers and single by Camilo Carreon -- a walk and a sacrifice fly.
Jim Landis' 380-foot home run over left in the first inning gave the Sox a 1-0 lead, but Harmon Killebrew came back in the bottom of the first with his second homer in two days with the walking Bob Allison aboard.
Al Smith's 340-blast over left in the fourth -- his fourth homer of the campaign -- tied the score and Carreon's first major league home run in the fifth put the Sox back in front.
A double by Green, Allison's run-scoring 2-baser, an infield single by Lemon and Gardner's solid single to center put the Twins back in front in the last of the fifth.
Ogden, Utah, May 1 -- ( A*p ) -- Boston Red Sox Outfielder Jackie Jensen said Monday night he was through playing baseball.
I've had it, he told a newsman.
I know when my reflexes are gone and I'm not going to be any 25th man on the ball club.
This was the first word from Jensen on his sudden walkout.
Jensen got only six hits in 46 at-bats for a.130
Batting average in the first 12 games.
He took a midnight train out of Cleveland Saturday, without an official word to anybody, and has stayed away from newsmen on his train trip across the nation to Reno, Nev., where his wife, former Olympic Diving Champion Zoe Ann Olsen, awaited.
She said, when she learned Jackie was heading home : I'm just speculating, but I have to think Jack feels he's hurting Boston's chances.
The Union Pacific Railroad streamliner, City of San Francisco, stopped in Ogden, Utah, for a few minutes.
Sports Writer Ensign Ritchie of the Ogden Standard Examiner went to his compartment to talk with him.
The conductor said to Ritchie : I don't think you want to talk to him.
You'll probably get a ball bat on the head.
He's mad at the world.
But Jackie had gone into the station.
Ritchie walked up to him at the magazine stand.
I told him who I was and he was quite cold.
But he warmed up after a while.
I told him what Liston had said and he said Liston was a double-crosser and said anything he ( Liston ) got was through a keyhole.
He said he had never talked to Liston.
Liston is Bill Liston, baseball writer for the Boston Traveler, who quoted Jensen as saying : I can't hit anymore.
I can't run.
I can't throw.
Suddenly my reflexes are gone.
Just when it seems baseball might be losing its grip on the masses up pops heroics to start millions of tongues to wagging.
And so it was over the weekend what with 40-year-old Warren Spahn pitching his no-hit masterpiece against the Giants and the Giants' Willie Mays retaliating with a record-tying 4-homer spree Sunday.
Both, of course, were remarkable feats and further embossed the fact that baseball rightfully is the national pastime.
Of the two cherished achievements the elderly Spahn's hitless pitching probably reached the most hearts.
It was a real stimulant to a lot of guys I know who have moved past the 2-score-year milestone.
And one of the Milwaukee rookies sighed and remarked, wish I was 40, and a top-grade big leaguer.
The modest and happy Spahn waved off his new laurels as one of those good days.
But there surely can be no doubt about the slender southpaw belonging with the all-time great lefthanders in the game's history.
Yes, with Bob Grove, Carl Hubbell, Herb Pennock, Art Nehf, Vernon Gomez, et al.
Spahn not only is a superior pitcher but a gentlemanly fine fellow, a ball player's ball player, as they say in the trade.
I remember his beardown performance in a meaningless exhibition game at Bears Stadium Oct. 14, 1951, before a new record crowd for the period of 18,792.
Spahnie doesn't know how to merely go through the motions, remarked Enos Slaughter, another all-out guy, who played rightfield that day and popped one over the clubhouse.
The spectacular Mays, who reaches a decade in the big leagues come May 25, joined six other sluggers who walloped four home runs in a span of nine innings.
Incidentally, only two did it before a home audience.
Bobby Lowe of Boston was the first to hit four at home and Gil Hodges turned the trick in Brooklyn's Ebbetts Field.
Ed Delahanty and Chuck Klein of the Phillies, the Braves' Joe Adcock, Lou Gehrig of the Yankees, Pat Seerey of the White Sox and Rocky Colavito, then with Cleveland, made their history on the road.
Willie's big day revived the running argument about the relative merits of Mays and Mickey Mantle.
This is an issue which boils down to a matter of opinion, depending on whether you're an American or National fan and anti or pro-*yankee.
The record books, however, would favor the Giants' ace.
In four of his nine previous seasons Mays hit as many as 25 home runs and stole as many as 25 bases.
Once the figure was 30-30.
Willie's lifetime batting average of.318
Is 11 points beyond Mickey's.
The Giants who had been anemic with the bat in their windy Candlestick Park suddenly found the formula in Milwaukee's park.
It will forever be a baseball mystery how a team will suddenly start hitting after a distressing slump.
The Denver-area *j audience was privileged to see Mays' four home runs, thanks to a new arrangement made by Bob Howsam that the games are not to be blacked out when his Bears are playing at home.
This rule providing for a blackout of televised baseball 30 minutes before the start of a major or minor league game in any area comes from the game's top rulers.
The last couple of years the Bears management got the business from the Living Room Athletic Club when games were cut off.
Actually they were helpless to do anything about the nationwide policy.
This year, I am told, the *j network will continue to abide by the rule but *j will play to a conclusion here.
There are two more Sunday afternoons when the situation will arise.
It is an irritable rule that does baseball more harm than good, especially at the minor league level.
You would be surprised how many fans purposely stayed away from Bears Stadium last year because of the television policy.
This dissatisfaction led to Howsam's request that the video not be terminated before the end of the game.
Cincinnati, Ohio ( A*p ) -- the powerful New York Yankees won their 19th world series in a 5-game romp over outclassed Cincinnati, crushing the Reds in a humiliating 13-5 barrage Monday in the loosely played finale.
With Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra both out of action due to injuries, the American League champs still mounted a 15-hit attack against a parade of eight Cincinnati pitchers, the most ever used by one team in a series game.
Johnny Blanchard, Mantle's replacement, slammed a 2-run homer as the Yankees routed loser Joey Jay in a 5-run first inning.
Hector Lopez, subbing for Berra, smashed a 3-run homer off Bill Henry during another 5-run explosion in the fourth.
The Yanks also took advantage of three Cincinnati errors.
The crowd of 32,589 had only two chances to applaud.
In the third Frank Robinson hammered a long home run deep into the corner of the bleachers in right center, about 400 feet away, with two men on.
Momentarily the Reds were back in the ball game, trailing only 6-3, but the drive fizzled when John Edwards fouled out with men on second and third and two out.
In the fifth, Wally Post slashed a 2-run homer off Bud Daley, but by that time the score was 11-5 and it really didn't matter.
The Yankee triumph made Ralph Houk only the third man to lead a team to both a pennant and a World Series victory in his first year as a manager.
Only Bucky Harris, the boy-manager of Washington in 1924, and Eddie Dyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1946 had accomplished the feat.
Philadelphia, Jan. 23 -- Nick Skorich, the line coach for the football champion Philadelphia Eagles, was elevated today to head coach.
Skorich received a three-year contract at a salary believed to be between $20,000 and $25,000 a year.
He succeeds Buck Shaw, who retired at the end of last season.
The appointment was announced at a news conference at which Skorich said he would retain two members of Shaw's staff -- Jerry Williams and Charlie Gauer.
Williams is a defensive coach.
Gauer works with the ends.
Choice was expected the selection had been expected.
Skorich was considered the logical choice after the club gave Norm Van Brocklin permission to seek the head coaching job with the Minnesota Vikings, the newest National Football League entry.
Van Brocklin, the quarterback who led the Eagles to the title, was signed by the Vikings last Wednesday.
Philadelphia permitted him to seek a better connection after he had refused to reconsider his decision to end his career as a player.
With Skorich at the helm, the Eagles are expected to put more emphasis on running, rather than passing.
In the past the club depended largely on Van Brocklin's aerials.
Skorich, however, is a strong advocate of a balanced attack -- split between running and passing.
Coach played 3 years Skorich, who is 39 years old, played football at Cincinnati University and then had a three-year professional career as a lineman under Jock Sutherland with the Pittsburgh Steelers.
An injury forced Skorich to quit after the 1948 season.
He began his coaching career at Pittsburgh Central Catholic High School in 1949.
He remained there for four years before moving to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N. Y..
He was there one season before rejoining the Steelers as an assistant coach.
Four years later he resigned to take a similar job with the Green Bay Packers.
The Eagles signed him for Shaw's staff in 1959.
Skorich began his new job auspiciously today.
At a ceremony in the reception room of Mayor Richardson Dilworth, the Eagles were honored for winning the championship.
Shaw and Skorich headed a group of players, coaches and team officials who received an engrossed copy of an official city citation and a pair of silver cufflinks shaped like a football.
With the announcement of a special achievement award to William A. ( Bill ) Shea, the awards list was completed yesterday for Sunday night's thirty-eighth annual dinner and show of the New York Chapter, Baseball Writers' Association of America, at the Waldorf-*astoria Hotel.
Shea, the chairman of Mayor Wagner's Baseball Committee, will be joined on the dais by Warren Spahn, the southpaw pitching ace of the Milwaukee Braves ; Frank Graham, the Journal-*american sports columnist ; Bill Mazeroski, the World Series hero of the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Casey Stengel, the former manager of the Yankees.
Stengel will receive the Ben Epstein Good Guy Award.
Mazeroski, whose homer beat the Yankees in the final series game, will receive the Babe Ruth Award as the outstanding player in the 1960 world series.
Graham will be recognized for his meritorious service to baseball and will get the William J. Slocum Memorial Award.
To Spahn will go the Sid Mercer Memorial Award as the chapter's player of the year.
Show follows ceremonies a crowd of 1,400 is expected for the ceremonies, which will be followed by the show in which the writers will lampoon baseball personalities in skit, dance and song.
The 53-year-old Shea, a prominent corporation lawyer with a sports background, is generally recognized as the man most responsible for the imminent return of a National League club to New York.
Named by Mayor Wagner three years ago to head a committee that included James A. Farley, Bernard Gimbel and Clint Blume, Shea worked relentlessly.
His goal was to obtain a National League team for this city.
The departure of the Giants and the Dodgers to California left New York with only the Yankees.
Despite countless barriers and disappointments, Shea moved forward.
When he was unable to bring about immediate expansion, he sought to convince another National League club to move here.
When that failed, he enlisted Branch Rickey's aid in the formation of a third major league, the Continental, with New York as the key franchise.
The Continental League never got off the ground, but after two years it forced the existing majors to expand.
Flushing stadium in works the New York franchise is headed by Mrs. Charles Shipman Payson.
A big-league municipal stadium at Flushing Meadow Park is in the works, and once the lease is signed the local club will be formally recognized by Commissioner Ford C. Frick.
Shea's efforts figure prominently in the new stadium.
Shea and his wife, Nori, make their home at Sands Point, L. I..
Bill Jr., 20, Kathy, 15, and Patricia, 9, round out the Shea family.
Shea was born in Manhattan.
He attended New York University before switching to Georgetown University in Washington.
He played basketball there while working toward a law degree.
Later, Shea owned and operated the Long Island Indians, a minor league professional football team.
He was the lawyer for Ted Collins' old Boston Yankees in the National Football League.
All was quiet in the office of the Yankees and the local National Leaguers yesterday.
On Friday, Roger Maris, the Yankee outfielder and winner of the American League's most-valuable-player award, will meet with Roy Hamey, the general manager.
Maris is in line for a big raise.
Arnold Palmer and Sam Snead will be among those honored at the national awards dinner of the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association tonight.
The dinner will be held at the Hotel Pierre.
Palmer, golf's leading money-winner in 1960, and Snead will be saluted as the winning team in the Canada Cup matches last June in Dublin.
Deane Beman, the National Amateur champion, and all the metropolitan district champions, including Bob Gardner, the amateur title-holder, also will receive awards.
The writers' Gold Tee Award will go to John Mc*auliffe of Plainfield, N. J., and Palm Beach, Fla., for his sponsorship of charity tournaments.
Horton Smith of Detroit, a former president of the Professional Golfers Association, will receive the Ben Hogan Trophy for his comeback following a recent illness.
The principal speaker will be Senator Stuart Symington, Democrat of Missouri.
Golf's golden boy Arnold Palmer has been a blazing figure in golf over the past twelve months.
He won the Masters, the United States Open and a record $80,738 in prize money.
He was heralded as Sportsman of the Year by Sports Illustrated, and last night was acclaimed in Rochester as the Professional Athlete of the Year, a distinction that earned for him the $10,000 diamond-studded Hickok Belt.
But he also achieved something that endeared him to every duffer who ever flubbed a shot.
A couple of weeks ago, he scored a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole.
It made him human.
And it also stayed the hands of thousands of brooding incompetents who were meditating the abandonment of a sport whose frustrations were driving them to despair.
If such a paragon of perfection as Palmer could commit such a scoring sacrilege, there was hope left for all.
It was neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivated Arnold.
He merely became victimized by a form of athletics that respects no one and aggravates all.
The world's best golfer, shooting below par, came to the last hole of the opening round of the Los Angeles open with every intention of delivering a final crusher.
He boomed a 280-yard drive.
Then the pixies and the zombies took over while the banshees wailed in the distance.
No margin for error on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole, Arnold whipped into his second shot.
The ball went off in a majestic arc, an out-of-bounds slice.
He tried again and once more sliced out of bounds.
He hooked the next two out of bounds on the opposite side.
It is possible that I over-corrected, he said ruefully.
Each of the four wayward shots cost him two strokes.
So he wound up with a dozen.
It was a nice round figure, that 12, he said as he headed for the clubhouse, not too much perturbed.
From the standpoint of the army of duffers, however, this was easily the most heartening exhibition they had had since Ben Hogan fell upon evil ways during his heyday and scored an 11 in the Texas open.
The idol of the hackers, of course, is Ray Ainsley, who achieved a 19 in the United States Open.
Their secondary hero is another pro, Willie Chisholm, who drank his lunch during another Open and tried to blast his way out of a rock-strewn gully.
Willie's partner was Long Jim Barnes, who tried to keep count.
Stickler for rules how many is that, Jim?
Asked Willie at one stage of his excavation project.
Thirteen, said Long Jim.
Nae, man, said Willie, ye must be countin' the echoes.
He had a 16.
Palmer's dozen were honestly earned.
Nor were there any rules to save him.
If there had been, he would have found a loophole, because Arnold is one golfer who knows the code as thoroughly as the man who wrote the book.
This knowledge has come in handy, too.
His first shot in the Open last year landed in a brook that flowed along the right side of the fairway.
The ball floated downstream.
A spectator picked up the ball and handed it to a small boy, who dropped this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie.
Arnold sent for Joe Dey, the executive secretary of the golf association.
Joe naturally ruled that a ball be dropped from alongside the spot where it had originally entered the stream.
I knew it all along, confessed Arnold with a grin, but I just happened to think how much nicer it would be to drop one way up there.
For a serious young man who plays golf with a serious intensity, Palmer has such an inherent sense of humor that it relieves the strain and keeps his nerves from jangling like banjo strings.
Yet he remains the fiercest of competitors.
He'll even bull head-on into the rules when he is sure he's right.
That's how he first won the Masters in 1958.
It happened on the twelfth hole, a 155-yarder.
Arnold's iron shot from the tee burrowed into the bunker guarding the green, an embankment that had become soft and spongy from the rains, thereby bringing local rules into force.
Ruling from on high I can remove the ball, can't I?
Asked Palmer of an official.
No, said the official.
You must play it where it lies.
You're wrong, said Arnold, a man who knows the rules.
I'll do as you say, but I'll also play a provisional ball and get a ruling.
He scored a 4 for the embedded ball, a 3 with the provisional one.
The golfing fathers ruled in his favor.
So he picked up a stroke with the provisional ball and won the tournament by the margin of that stroke.
Until a few weeks ago, however, Arnold Palmer was some god-like creature who had nothing in common with the duffers.
But after that 12 at Los Angeles he became one of the boys, a bigger hero than he ever had been before.
A formula to supply players for the new Minneapolis Vikings and the problem of increasing the 1961 schedule to fourteen games will be discussed by National Football League owners at a meeting at the Hotel Warwick today.
Other items on the agenda during the meetings, which are expected to continue through Saturday, concern television, rules changes, professional football's hall of fame, players' benefits and constitutional amendments.
The owners would like each club in the fourteen-team league to play a home-and-home series with teams in its division, plus two games against teams in the other division.
However, this would require a lengthening of the season from thirteen to fourteen weeks.
Pete Rozelle, the league commissioner, pointed out : we'll have the problem of baseball at one end and weather at the other.
Nine of the league's teams play in baseball parks and therefore face an early-season conflict in dates.
If the Cardinals heed Manager Gene Mauch of the Phillies, they won't be misled by the Pirates' slower start this season.
Pittsburgh definitely is the team to beat, Mauch said here the other day.
The Pirates showed they could outclass the field last year.
They have the same men, no age problem, no injuries and they also have Vinegar Bend Mizell for the full season, along with Bobby Shantz.
Tonight at 8 o'clock the Cardinals, who gave the Pirates as much trouble as anyone did in 1960, breaking even with them, will get their first 1961 shot at baseball's world champions.
The Pirates have a 9-6 record this year and the Redbirds are 7-9.
Change in pitchers.
Solly Hemus announced a switch in his starting pitcher, from Bob Gibson to Ernie Broglio, for several reasons : 1 Broglio's 4-0 won-lost record and 1.24 earned-run mark against Pittsburgh a year ago ; 2 the desire to give Broglio as many starts possible ; 3 the Redbirds' disheartening 11-7 collapse against the Phillies Sunday.
Manager Hemus, eager to end a pitching slump that has brought four losses in the five games on the current home stand, moved Gibson to the Wednesday night starting assignment.
After Thursday's open date, Solly plans to open with Larry Jackson against the Cubs here Friday night.
Harvey Haddix, set back by the flu this season, will start against his former Cardinal mates, who might be playing without captain Kenny Boyer in tonight's game at Busch Stadium.
Boyer is suffering from a stiff neck.
Haddix has a 13-8 record against the Redbirds, despite only a 1-3 mark in 1960.
Pirate Manager Danny Murtaugh said he hadn't decided between Mizell and Vern Law for Wednesday's game.
Mizell has won both of his starts.
Nieman kept in lineup.
After a lengthy workout yesterday, an open date, Hemus said that Bob Nieman definitely would stay in the lineup.
That means Stan Musial probably will ride the bench on the seventh anniversary of his record five-home run day against the Giants.
I have to stay with Nieman for a while, Hemus said.
Bill White ( sore ankles ) should be ready.
With a lefthander going for Pittsburgh, I may use Don Taussig in center.
Lindy Mc*daniel threw batting practice about 25 minutes, and he looked good, Hemus said.
He should be getting back in the groove before long.
Our pitching is much better than it has shown.
The statistics hardly indicated that the Pirates needed extra batting practice, but Murtaugh also turned his men loose at Busch Stadium yesterday.
Six Bucks over.300
.
Until the Bucs' bats quieted down a bit in Cincinnati over the weekend, the champions had eight men hitting over.300
.
Despite the recession, Pittsburgh came into town with this imposing list of averages : Smoky Burgess.455
, Gino Cimoli.389
, Bill Virdon.340
, Bob Clemente and Dick Groat, each.323
, Dick Stuart.306
, Don Hoak.280
And Bob Skinner.267
.
Bill Mazeroski with.179
And Hal Smith with.143
Were the only Pirates dragging their feet.
Perhaps the Pirate who will be the unhappiest over the news that Musial probably will sit out most of the series is Bob Friend, who was beaten by The Man twice last season on dramatic home runs.
Friend is off to a great start with a 4-0 record but isn't likely to see action here this week.
We're getting Friend some runs for a change, and he has been pitching good, Murtaugh said.
Virdon has been blasting the ball.
No plunkers for him.
Six Bucs over.300
.
The Pirates jumped off to an 11-3 start by May 1 last year, when the Redbirds as well as the Dodgers held them even over the season.
On last May 1, the Cardinals stood at 7-6, ending a two-season fall-off on that milestone.
In 1958, the Birds were 3-10 on May 1.
A year later they were 4-13.
Since 1949, the St. Louis club has been below.500
On May 1 just four times.
The '49 team was off to a so-so 5-5 beginning, then fell as low as 12-17 on May 23 before finishing with 96 victories.
The '52 Cards were 6-7 on May 1 but ended with 88 triumphs, the club's top since 1949.
Then last season the Birds tumbled as low as 11-18 on May 19 before recovering to make a race of it and total 86 victories.
Since 1949, the only National League club that got off to a hot start and made a runaway of the race was the '55 Dodger team.
Those Dodgers won their first 10 games and owned a 21-2 mark and a nine-game lead by May 8.
The club that overcame the worst start in a comparable period to win the pennant was New York's '51 Giants, who dropped 11 of their first 13.
They honored the battling Billikens last night.
Speakers at a Tipoff Club dinner dealt lavish praise to a group of St. Louis University players who, in the words of Coach John Benington, had more confidence in themselves than I did.
The most valuable player award was split three ways, among Glen Mankowski, Gordon Hartweger and Tom Kieffer.
In addition, a special award was given to Bob ( Bevo ) Nordmann, the 6-foot-10 center who missed much of the season because of a knee injury.
You often hear people talk about team spirit and that sort of thing, Benington said in a conversation after the ceremonies, but what this team had was a little different.
The boys had a tremendous respect for each other's ability.
They knew what they could do and it was often a little more than I thought they could do.
Several times I found the players pepping me up, where it usually is the coach who is supposed to deliver the fight talk.
We'd be losing at halftime to a good team and Hartweger would say, don't worry, Coach -- we'll get 'em all right.
The trio who shared the most-valuable honors were introduced by Bob Broeg, sports editor of the Post-*dispatch.
Kieffer, the only junior in the group, was commended for his ability to hit in the clutch, as well as his all-round excellent play.
Mankowski, the ball-hawking defensive expert, was cited for his performance against Bradley in St. Louis U.'s nationally televised victory.
Benington said, I've never seen a player have a game as great as Mankowski did against Bradley that day.
Benington recalled that he once told Hartweger that he doubted Gordon would ever play much for him because he seemed to be lacking in all of the accepted basketball skills.
After the coach listed all the boy's faults, Hartweger said, Coach before I leave here, you'll get to like me.
Mrs. Benington admired Gordon's spirit and did what she could to persuade her husband that the boy might help the team.
As Hartweger accepted his silver bowl, he said, I want to thank coach's wife for talking him into letting me play.
Bob Burnes, sports editor of the Globe-*democrat, presented Bob Nordmann with his award.
Bevo was congratulated for his efforts to stay in shape so that he could help the team if his knee healed in time.
Within a week after the injury, suffered in St. Louis's victory in the final game of the Kentucky tournament, Nordmann was sitting on the Bill's bench doing what he could to help Benington.
On the clock given him was the inscription, For Outstanding Contribution to Billiken Basketball, 1960-61.
Other lettermen from the team that compiled a 21-9 record and finished as runner-up in the National Invitation Tournament were : Art Hambric, Donnell Reid, Bill Nordmann, Dave Harris, Dave Luechtefeld and George Latinovich.
This team set a precedent that could be valuable in the future, Benington pointed out.
By winning against Bradley, Kentucky and Notre Dame on those teams' home courts, they showed that the home court advantage can be overcome anywhere and that it doesn't take a super team to do it.
St. Louis University found a way to win a baseball game.
Larry Scherer last night pitched a no-hit game, said to be the first in Billiken baseball history, as the Blue and White beat Southeast Missouri State College, 5-1, at Crystal City.
The victory was the first of the season for the Billikens after nine defeats and a tie.
The tie was against Southeast Missouri last Friday.
Scherer also had a big night at bat with four hits in five trips including a double, Len Boehmer also was 4-for-5 with two doubles and Dave Ritchie had a home run and a triple.
St. Louis U. was to be in action again today with a game scheduled at 4 against Washington University at Ligget Field.
The game opened a busy week for Washington.
The Bears are set to play at Harris Teachers College at 3:30 tomorrow and have a doubleheader at Quincy, Ill., Saturday.
Happy hitting if it's true that contented cows give more milk, why shouldn't happy ball players produce more base hits?
The two top talents of the time, Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays, have hit the ball harder and more successfully so far this early season than at any period in careers which, to be frank about it, never have quite reached expectations.
And that's meant as a boost, not a knock.
Mays and Mantle, both 10-year men at 30, have so much ability that, baseball men agree, they've never hit the heights.
Their heights, that is.
Mantle, the bull-necked blond switch-hitter, had one sensational triple-crown season, 1959, when he batted.365
And also led the American League in home runs, 52, and rbi's, 130.
Like the Yankees' slugger, Mays, the terror of the Giants, has had seasons that would be considered the ultimate by most players, but not by -- or for -- Willie.
His best years were 1954 when he hit.345
With 41 homers and '55 when he belted 51 home runs, drove in 127 and stole 24 bases.
Now, apparently happier under new managers, Mays and Mantle, the perfect players, are behaving as though they're going to pass those previous peaks.
Labor relations yes, we know, they're professionals, men paid to play, and they shouldn't care how they're handled, just as long as their names are spelled correctly on the first and fifteenth of each month.
The truth is, though, that men react differently to different treatment.
For that matter, Stan Musial is rare, possessing the disposition that enabled him to put out the same for seven managers, reserving his opinions, but not his effort.
Mantle, it's apparent, resented Casey Stengel's attempts to push and prod him into the perfection the veteran manager saw as a thrilling possibility.
The old man was almost too possessive.
Stengel inherited Di*maggio, Rizzuto, but he brought up Mantle from Class *j to the majors, from Joplin to New York.
With the speed and power of the body beautiful he saw before him, Ol' Case wanted No. 7 to be not only the best homerun hitter, but also the best bunter, base-runner and outfielder.
Stengel probably preached too much in the early days when the kid wanted to pop his bubble gum and sow his oats.
Inheriting a more mature Mantle, who now has seen the sights on and off Broadway, Ralph Houk quietly bestowed, no pun intended, the mantle of authority on Mickey.
The Major decided that, rather than be led, the slugger could lead.
And what leadership a proud Mantle has given so far.
The opinion continues here that with a 162-game schedule, pitching spread thin through a 10-team league and a most inviting target in Los Angeles' Wrigley Field Jr., Mantle just might break the most glamorous record on the books, Babe Ruth's 60 homers of 1927.
Four for Alvin Mays' day came a day earlier for Willie than for the kids and Commies this year.
Willie's wonderful walloping Sunday -- four home runs -- served merely to emphasize how happy he is to be playing for Alvin Dark.
Next to Leo Durocher, Dark taught Mays the most when he was a grass-green rookie rushed up to the Polo Grounds 10 years ago this month, to help the Giants win a dramatic pennant.
Romantic news concerns Mrs. Joan Monroe Armour and F. Lee H. Wendell, who are to be married at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow in the Lake Forest home of her brother, J. Hampton Monroe, and Mrs. Monroe.

Back with the Met we are back with the Met again now that the Met is back in Chicago, bulletins Mrs. Frank S. Sims, president of the women's board of the University of Chicago Cancer Research Foundation.
The New York Metropolitan Opera Company will be here in May, and the board will sponsor the Saturday night, May 13, performance of Turandot as a benefit.
Birgit Nilsson will be starred.
Housed in the new Mc*cormick Place theater, this should prove to be an exciting evening, adds Mrs. Sims.
The board's last money raising event was a performance by Harry Belafonte -- quite off-beat for this group, decided some of the members.
Mrs. Henry T. Sulcer of Winnetka, a new board member, will be chairman of publicity for the benefit.
Her husband recently was appointed vice president of the university, bringing them back here from the east.
Parichy-*hamm because of the recent death of the bride's father, Frederick B. Hamm, the marriage of Miss Terry Hamm to John Bruce Parichy will be a small one at noon tomorrow in St. Bernadine's church, Forest Park.

With loud huzzahs for the artistic success of the Presbyterian-*st. Luke's Fashion show still ringing in her ears, its director, Helen Tieken Geraghty ( Mrs. Maurice P. Geraghty ) is taking off tomorrow on a 56 day world trip which should earn her even greater acclaim as director of entertainment for next summer's International Trade fair.
Armed with letters from embassies to ministers of countries, especially those in the near and far east, Mrs. Geraghty will beat the bushes for oriental talent.
We ( the Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry ) expect to establish closer relations with nations and their cultural activities, and it will be easy as a member of the fair staff to bring in acts, explains Mrs. Geraghty.
For instance, Djakarta, Indonesia, has three groups of dancers interested in coming here.
I'm even going to try to get the whirling dervishes of Damascus ] the last obstacle in Mrs. Geraghty's globe-girdling trip was smoothed out when a representative of Syria called upon her to explain that his brother would meet her at the border of that country -- so newly separated from Egypt and the United Arab Republic that she hadn't been able to obtain a visa.
First, Honolulu Honolulu will be Mrs. Geraghty's first stop.
Then Japan, Hong Kong, Manila, India, Pakistan, Damascus, Beirut, and to Rome, London, and Paris to look over wonderful talent.
Dec. 22 is the deadline for Mrs. Geraghty's return ; the Geraghtys' youngest daughter, Molly, bows in the Passavant Debutante Cotillion the next night.
Molly already has her cotillion gown, and it's fitted, says her mother.
Also, invitations have been addressed to Molly's debut tea the afternoon of Dec. 29 in the Arts club.
It won't be a tea, however, but more of an international folk song festival, with singers from Chicago's foreign groups to sing Christmas songs from around the world.
The international theme will be continued with the Balkan strings playing for a dinner the Byron Harveys will give in the Racquet club after the tea.
Miss Abra Prentice's debut supper dance in the Casino will wind up the day.
Burke-*rostagno the Richard S. Burkes' home in Wayne may be the setting for the wedding reception for their daughter, Helen Lambert, and the young Italian she met last year while studying in Florence during her junior year at Smith college.
He is Aldo Rostagno, son of the Guglielmo Rostagnos of Florence whom the Burkes met last year in Europe.
The Burkes, who now live in Kankakee, are telling friends of the engagement.
Miss Burke, a graduate of Miss Hall's school, stayed on in Florence as a career girl.
Her fiance, who is with a publishing firm, translates many books from English into Italian.
He will be coming here on business in December, when the wedding is to take place in Wayne.
Miss Burke will arrive in December also.

Those qualities make Esther Marr a popular asset at the Salvation Army's Social Center at 1200 Larimer St..
The pert, gray-haired woman who came to Denver three years ago from Buffalo, N.*y., is a civilian with the Army.
Her position covers a number of daily tasks common to any social director.
The job also covers a number of other items.
Mom Marr, as the more than 80 men at the center call her, is the link that helps to bridge the gulf between alcoholics and the outside world and between parolees and society.
Her day starts early, but no matter how many pressing letters there are to be written ( and during May, which is National Salvation Army Week, there are plenty ), schedules to be made or problems to be solved, Mrs. Marr's office is always open and the welcome mat is out.
Mrs. Marr is the first contact a Skid Row figure talks to after he decides he wants to pick himself up.
She sees that there is a cup of steaming hot coffee awaiting him and the two chat informally as she presents the rules of the center and explains procedures.
Usually at this point a man is withdrawn from society and one of my jobs is to see that he relearns to mingle with his fellow men, Mrs. Marr explained.
The Denverite has worked out an entire program to achieve this using the facilities of the center.
And I bum tickets to everything I can, she said.
I've become the greatest beggar in the world.
In addition to the tickets to the movies, sporting events and concerts, Mrs. Marr lines up candy and cookies because alcoholics require a lot of sweets to replace the sugar in their system.
Mrs. Marr also has a number of parolees to mother, watching to see that they do not break their parole and that they also learn to readjust to society.
By mid-*june, millions of Americans will take to the road on vacation trips up and down and back and forth across this vast and lovely land.
In another four weeks, with schools closed across the nation, the great all-*american summer safari will be under way.
By July 1, six weeks from now, motel-keepers all over the nation will, by 6 p.m., be switching on that bleak -- to motorists -- sign, No Vacancy.
No matter how many Americans go abroad in summer, probably a hundred times as many gas up the family car, throw suitcases, kids and comic books in the back seat, and head for home.
And where is home, that magic place of the heart?
Ah, that is simple.
Home is where a man was born, reared, went to school and, most particularly, where grandma is.
That is where we turn in the good old summertime.
The land lies ready for the coming onslaught.
My husband and I, a month ahead of the rush, have just finished a 7-day motor journey of 2809 miles from Tucson, Ariz., to New York City : set for influx I can testify that motels, service and comfort stations ( they go together like Scots and heather ), dog wagons, roadside restaurants, souvenir stands and snake farms are braced and waiting.
I hope it can be said without boasting that no other nation offers its vacationing motorists such variety and beauty of scene, such an excellent network of roads on which to enjoy it and such decent, far-flung over-night accommodations.
Maybe motel-keeping isn't the nation's biggest industry, but it certainly looks that way from the highway.
There are motels for all purposes and all tastes.
There are even motels for local weather peculiarities in Shamrock, Tex., as I discovered.
There the Royal Motel advertises all facilities, vented heat, air conditioned, carpeted, free *j, storm cellar.
Many with pools innumerable motels from Tucson to New York boast swimming pools ( swim at your own risk is the hospitable sign poised at the brink of most pools ).
Some even boast two pools, one for adults and one for children.
But the Royal Motel in Shamrock was the only one that offered the comfort and security of a storm cellar.
Motorists like myself who can remember the old tourists accommodated signs on farm houses and village homes before World War 2 can only marvel at the great size and the luxury of the relatively new and fast-grossing motel business.
All for $14 ] at the Boxwood Motel in Winchester, Va., we accidentally drew the honeymoon suite, an elegant affair with wall-to-wall carpeting, gold and white furniture, pink satin brocade chairs, 24-inch *j and a pink tile bath with masses of pink towels.
All for $14.
That made up for the best motel in Norman, Okla., where the proprietor knocked $2 off the $8.50 tab when we found ants in the pressed-paper furniture.
Oxnard, Calif., will be the home of the Rev. Robert D. Howard and his bride, the former Miss Judith Ellen Gay, who were married Saturday at the Munger Place Methodist Church.

A Night in New Orleans is the gayety planned by members of the Thrift Shop Committee for May 6 at Philmont Country Club.
The women have a reputation for giving parties that are different and are fun and this year's promises to follow in this fine tradition.
Mrs. H. J. Grinsfelder is chairman.
The Louisiana city is known, of course, for its fine food, good music and its colorful hospitality and, when guests arrive at Philmont that night, says Mrs. Grinsfelder, that is exactly what we expect to offer them.
We've been working for weeks.
The prospects look great.
We are keeping a number of surprises under our hats.
But we can't tell it all now and then have no new excitement later.
Basin Street Beat but she does indicate festivities will start early, that a jazz combo will give with the Basin Street beat during the cocktail and dinner hours and that Lester Lanin's orchestra will take over during the dancing.
As for food, Mrs. Henry Louchheim, chairman of this phase, is a globetrotter who knows good food.
New Orleans?
She says, of course I've had the best.
It is just bad luck that we are having the party in a month with no *j, so no oysters.
But we have lots of other New Orleans specialties.
I know they will be good.
We've tried them out on the club chef -- or say, he has tried them out on us and we have selected the best.
Scenic effects guests will be treated to Gulf Coast scenic effects.
There will be masses of flowers, reproductions of the handsome old buildings with their grillwork and other things that are typical of New Orleans.
Mrs. Harry K. Cohen is chairman of this phase and she is getting an artistic assist from A. Van Hollander, display director of Gimbel Brothers.
The gala is the Thrift Shop's annual bundle party and, as all Thrift Shop friends know, that means the admission is a bundle of used clothing in good condition, contributions of household equipment, bric-a-brac and such to stock the shelves at the shop's headquarters at 1213 Walnut St..
Bundle centers for the convenience of guests bundle centers have been established throughout the city and suburbs where the donations may be deposited between now and the date of the big event.
In addition to the bundles, guests pay the cost of their dinners.
Members of the young set who would like to come to the party only during the dancing time are welcomed.
The Thrift Shop, with Mrs. Bernhard S. Blumenthal as president, is one of the city's most successful fund-raisers for the Federation of Jewish Agencies.
Some idea of the competence of the women is indicated in the contribution made by them during the past 25 years that totals $840,000.
It's big business big business, this little Thrift Shop business, say the members.
For most of the 25 years the operation was under feminine direction.
In the past few years the men, mostly husbands of members, have taken an interest.
Louis Glazer is chairman of the men's committee that, among other jobs, takes over part of the responsibility for staffing the shop during its evening hours.
Mrs. Theodore Kapnek is vice chairman of the committee for the gala.
Mrs. Richard Newburger is chairman of hostesses.
Mrs. Arthur Loeb is making arrangements for a reception ; Mrs. Joan Lichtenstein, for publicity ; Mrs. Harry M. Rose, Jr., for secretarial duties ; Mrs. Ralph Taussig, for junior aides ; Mr. and Mrs. B. Lewis Kaufnabb, for senior aides, and Mrs. Samuel P. Weinberg, for the bundles.
In addition, Mr. and Mrs. Allan Goodman are controllers, Mrs. Paul Stone is treasurer and Mrs. Albert Quell is in charge of admittance for the dancing at 9 P.m..
Besides the bundle centers where contributions may be made there will be facilities at Philmont Country Club for those who would like to bring the bundles on the night of the party.

Col. Clifton Lisle, of Chester Springs, who headed the Troop Committee for much of its second and third decades, is now an honorary member.
Each year he invites the boys to camp out on his estate for one of their big week ends of the year.
The Troop is proud of its camping-out program -- on year-round schedule and was continued even when sub-zero temperatures were registered during the past winter.
We worry, say the mothers.
But there never is any need.
The boys love it.
Mrs. John Charles Cotty is chairman of publicity for the country fair and Mrs. Francis G. Felske and Mrs. Francis Smythe, of posters.
They all are of Wayne.

The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad announced yesterday it would reduce the total amount of its payroll by 10 per cent through salary cuts and lay-offs effective at 12:01 A.*m. next Saturday.
The current monthly payroll comes to about $15,000,000.
Howard E. Simpson, the railroad's president, said, a drastic decline in freight loading due principally to the severe slump in the movement of heavy goods has necessitated this regrettable action.
The reduction in expenses will affect employees in the thirteen states in which the B. & O. operates.
Salary cut and lay-offs it will be accomplished in two ways : 1 a flat reduction of 10 per cent in the salary of all officers, supervisors and other employees not belonging to unions.
There are about 3,325 officers and employees in this class.
2 sufficient lay-offs of union employees to bring about a 10 per cent cut in the union payroll expense.
Since the railroad cannot reduce the salary of individual union members under contract, it must accomplish its payroll reduction by placing some of the men on furlough, a B. & O. spokesman said.
Those union members kept on their jobs, therefore, will not take a cut in their wages.
The spokesman said the number to be furloughed cannot be estimated since the lay-offs must be carried out in each area depending on what men are most needed on the job.
A thug struck a cab driver in the face with a pistol last night after robbing him of $18 at Franklin and Mount Streets.
The victim, Norman B. Wiley, 38, of the 900 block North Charles Street, was treated for cuts at Franklin Square Hospital after the robbery.
The driver told police he followed as the Negro man got out of the cab with his money.
The victim was beaten when he attempted to stop the bandit.
He said the assailant, who was armed with a.45-CALIBER
Automatic, entered the taxi at Pennsylvania Avenue and Gold Street.
In another attack, Samuel Verstandig, 41, proprietor of a food store in the 2100 block Aiken Street, told police two Negroes assaulted him in his store and stole $150 from the cash register after choking and beating him.
A baby was burned to death and two other children were seriously injured last night in a fire which damaged their one-room Anne Arundel county home.
The victim Darnell Somerville, Negro, 1, was pronounced dead on arrival at Anne Arundel General Hospital in Annapolis.
His sister and brother, Marie Louise, 3, and John Raymond, Jr. 22 months, were admitted to the hospital.
The girl was in critical condition with burns over 90 per cent of her body.
Boy in fair condition the boy received second-degree burns of the face, neck and back.
His condition was reported to be fair.
Police said the children's mother, Mrs. Eleanor Somerville, was visiting next door when the fire occurred.
The house is on Old Annapolis road a mile south of Severna Park, at Jones Station, police said.
Annapolis, Jan. 7 -- the Anne Arundel county school superintendent has asked that the Board of Education return to the practice of recording its proceedings mechanically so that there will be no more question about who said what.
The proposal was made by Dr. David S. Jenkins after he and Mrs. D. Ellwood Williams, Jr., a board member and long-time critic of the superintendent, argued for about fifteen minutes at this week's meeting.
The disagreement was over what Dr. Jenkins had said at a previous session and how his remarks appeared in the minutes presented at the following meeting.
Cites discrepancies Mrs. Williams had a list which she said contained about nine or ten discrepancies between her memory of Dr. Jenkins's conversation and how they were written up for the board's approval.
I hate to have these things come up again and again, Dr. Jenkins commented as he made his suggestion.
These are the board's minutes.
I'll write what you tell me to.
For a number of years the board used a machine to keep a permanent record but abandoned the practice about two years ago.
It was about that time, a board member said later, that Dr. Thomas G. Pullen, Jr., State superintendent of schools, told Dr. Jenkins and a number of other education officials that he would not talk to them with a recording machine sitting in front of him.
The Board of County Commissioners, the Sanitary Commission, the Planning and Zoning Board and other county official bodies use recording machines for all public business in order to prevent law suits and other misunderstandings about what actually happened at their meetings.
Dr. Jenkins notes, however, that most of the school boards in the State do not do so.
State Senator Joseph A. Bertorelli ( D., First Baltimore ) had a stroke yesterday while in his automobile in the 200 block of West Pratt Street.
He was taken to University Hospital in a municipal ambulance.
Doctors at the hospital said he was partially paralyzed on the right side.
His condition was said to be, fair.
Police said he became ill while parked in front of a barber shop at 229 West Pratt Street.
Barber summoned he called Vincent L. Piraro, proprietor of the shop, who summoned police and an ambulance.
The vice president of the City Council complained yesterday that there are deficiencies in the city's snow clearing program which should be corrected as soon as possible.
Councilman William D. Schaefer ( D., Fifth ) said in a letter to Mayor Grady that plowing and salting crews should be dispatched earlier in storms and should be kept on the job longer than they were last month.
Werner criticized conceding that several cities to the north were in worse shape than Baltimore after the last storm, Mr. Schaefer listed several improvements he said should be made in the snow plan here.
He said the snow plan was put in effect too slowly in December.
Equipment should be in operation almost immediately after the first snowfall, Mr. Schaefer said.
The Councilman, who is the Administration floor leader, also criticized Bernard L. Werner, public works director, for halting snow operations on Tuesday night after the Sunday storm.
Sent home for rest Mr. Werner said yesterday that operations continued through the week.
What he did, Mr. Werner said, was let manual laborers go home Tuesday night for some rest.
Work resumed Wednesday, he said.
Mr. Schaefer also recommended that the snow emergency route plan, under which parking is banned on key streets and cars are required to use snow tires or chains on them, should be strictly enforced.
Admitting that main streets and the central business district should have priority, the Councilman said it is also essential that small shopping areas not be overlooked if our small merchants are to survive.
Recounting personal observations of clearance work, the Councilman cited instances of inefficient use of equipment or supplies by poorly trained workers and urged that plow blades be set so they do not leave behind a thin layer of snow which eventually freezes.
Annapolis, Jan. 7 ( special ) -- the 15-year-old adopted son of a Washington attorney and his wife, who were murdered early today in their Chesapeake Bay-front home, has been sent to Spring Grove State Hospital for detention.
The victims were H. Malone Dresbach, 47, and his wife, Shirley, 46.
Each had been shot in the back several times with a.22-CALIBER
Automatic rifle, according to Capt. Elmer Hagner, chief of Anne Arundel detectives.
Judge Benjamin Michaelson signed the order remanding the boy to the hospital because of the lack of juvenile accommodations at the Anne Arundel County Jail.
The Circuit Court jurist said the boy will have a hearing in Juvenile Court.
Younger son calls police soon after 10 A.*m., when police reached the 1-1/2-story brick home in the Franklin Manor section, 15 miles south of here on the bay, in response to a call from the Dresbach's other son, Lee, 14, they found Mrs. Dresbach's body on the first-floor bedroom floor.
Her husband was lying on the kitchen floor, police said.
The younger son told police his brother had run from the house after the shootings and had driven away in their mother's car.
The description of the car was immediately broadcast throughout Southern Maryland on police radio.
Two brothers adopted police said the boys are natural brothers and were adopted as small children by the Dresbachs.
Trooper J. A. Grzesiak spotted the wanted car, with three boys, at a Route 2 service station, just outside Annapolis.
The driver admitted he was the Dresbachs' son and all three were taken to the Edgewater Station, police said.
Annapolis, Jan. 7 -- Governor Tawes today appointed Lloyd L. Simpkins, his administrative assistant, as Maryland's Secretary of State.
Mr. Simpkins will move into the post being vacated by Thomas B. Finan, earlier named Attorney General to succeed C. Ferdinand Sybert, who will be elevated to an associate judgeship on the Maryland Court of Appeals.
Governor Tawes announced that a triple swearing-in ceremony will be held in his office next Friday.
Simpkins from Somerset Mr. Simpkins is a resident of Somerset county, and he and the Governor, also a Somerset countian, have been friends since Mr. Simpkins was a child.
Now 38, Mr. Simpkins was graduated from the University of Maryland's College of Agriculture in 1947.
Five years later, he was awarded the university's degree in law.
Mr. Simpkins made a name for himself as a member of the House of Delegates from 1951 through 1958.
From the outset of his first term, he established himself as one of the guiding spirits of the House of Delegates.
Maryland contracts for future construction during October totaled $77,389,000, up to 10 per cent compared to October, 1960, F. W. Dodge, Dodge Corporation, reported.
Dodge reported the following breakdown : nonresidential at $20,447,000, down 28 per cent ; residential at $47,101,000, up 100 per cent ; and heavy engineering at $9,841,000, down 45 per cent.
The cumulative total of construction contracts for the first ten months of 1961 amounted to $634,517,000, a 4 per cent increase compared to the corresponding period of last year.
A breakdown of the ten-month total showed : nonresidential at $253,355,000, up 22 per cent ; residential at $278,877,000, up 12 per cent ; and heavy engineering at $102,285,000, down 33 per cent.
Residential building consists of houses, apartments, hotels, dormitories and other buildings designed for shelter.
The share of the new housing market enjoyed by apartments, which began about six years ago, has more than tripled within that span of time.
In 1961, it is estimated that multiple unit dwellings will account for nearly 30 per cent of the starts in residential construction.
While availability of mortgage money has been a factor in encouraging apartment construction, the generally high level of prosperity in the past few years plus rising consumer income are among the factors that have encouraged builders to concentrate in the apartment-building field.
Although economic and personal circumstances vary widely among those now choosing apartments, Leo J. Pantas, vice president of a hardware manufacturing company, pointed out recently that many apartment seekers seem to have one characteristic in common : a desire for greater convenience and freedom from the problems involved in maintaining a house.
Convenience held key convenience is therefore the key to the housing market today.
Trouble-free, long-life, quality components will play an increasingly important part in the merchandising of new housing in 1960, Pantas predicted.
Sixty-seven living units are being added to the 165-unit Harbor View Apartments in the Cherry Hill section.
Ultimately the development will comprise 300 units, in two-story and three-story structures.
Various of the apartments are of the terrace type, being on the ground floor so that entrance is direct.
Others, which are reached by walking up a single flight of stairs, have balconies.
The structures housing the apartments are of masonry and frame construction.
Heating is by individual gas-fired, forced warm air systems.
Construction in 1962 will account for about 15 per cent of the gross national product, according to a study by Johns-*manville Corporation.
London, Feb. 9 -- vital secrets of Britain's first atomic submarine, the Dreadnought, and, by implication, of the entire United States navy's still-building nuclear sub fleet, were stolen by a London-based soviet spy ring, secret service agents testified today.
The Dreadnought was built on designs supplied by the United States in 1959 and was launched last year.
It is a killer sub -- that is, a hunter of enemy subs.
It has a hull patterned on that of the United States navy's Nautilus, the world's first atomic submarine.
Its power unit, however, was derived from the reactor of the more modern American nuclear submarine Skipjack.
Five held for trial the announcement that the secrets of the Dreadnought had been stolen was made in Bow St. police court here at the end of a three day hearing.
A full trial was ordered for : two British civil servants, Miss Ethel Gee, 46, and her newly devoted friend, Harry Houghton, 55, and divorced.
They are accused of whisking secrets out of naval strongrooms over which they kept guard.
Gordon A. Lonsdale, 37, a mystery man presumed to be Russian although he carries a Canadian passport.
When arrested, he had the submarine secrets on a roll of candid camera film as well as anti-submarine secrets in Christmas gift wrapping, it was testified.
Flashed to Moscow a shadowy couple who call themselves Peter Kroger, bookseller, and wife, Joyce.
( in Washington, the Federal Bureau of Investigation identified the Krogers as Morris and Lola Cohen, an American couple formerly of New York City ).
In their suburban cottage the crown charges, the Krogers received secrets from the mystery man, usually on the first Saturday evening of each month, and spent much of the week-end getting the secrets off to Moscow, either on a powerful transmitter buried under the kitchen floor or as dots posted over period marks in used books.
Each dot on magnification resumed its original condition as a drawing, a printed page, or a manuscript.
All five pleaded innocent.
Only Miss Gee asked for bail.
Her young British lawyer, James Dunlop, pleaded that she was sorely needed at her Portland home by her widowed mother, 80, her maiden aunt, also 80 and bedridden for 20 years, and her uncle, 76, who once ran a candy shop.
Refuses to grant bail I am not prepared to grant bail to any of them, said the magistrate, K.*j.*p. Baraclough.
The trial will be held, probably the first week of March, in the famous Old Bailey central criminal court where Klaus Fuchs, the naturalized British German born scientist who succeeded in giving American and British atomic bomb secrets to Russia and thereby changed world history during the 1950s, was sentenced to 14 years in prison.
Fourteen years is the maximum penalty now faced by the new five, who may have altered history in the 1960s.
Fuchs, after nine and a half years, was released, being given time off for good behavior.
He promptly went to communist East Germany.
The magistrate tonight refused to return to the five $29,000 in American and British currency, mostly $20 bills, and in British government bonds and stocks.
This is Russian money, said Mervin Griffith-*jones for the attorney general's office.
He asserted that the Krogers were the bankers for Moscow, Lonsdale the Red paymaster, and the two civil servants the recipients for selling their country's secrets.
Of highest value the fact that secrets of the Dreadnought, and thereby of the American undersea fleet, were involved in the spy case had been hinted at earlier.
But just before luncheon today the fact was announced grimly by the British navy's chief adviser to the cabinet on underwater warfare, Capt. George Symonds.
He said that drawings of the Dreadnought and printed details about the ship were found reproduced in an undeveloped roll of film taken from Lonsdale when he was arrested with the two civil servants outside the Old Vic theater Saturday afternoon, Jan. 7.
The information, he said, would have been of the highest value to a potential enemy.
Court cleared just how many sub secrets were being handed over when the ring, watched for six months, was broken remained untold.
The British defending lawyers, who today increased from three to four, demanded to know if they could make the information involved seem of little value to a jury, the chances of their clients would improve.
So in the name of justice the magistrate cleared the court of all except officials to allow the captain to elaborate for almost an hour.
Almost any information about the Dreadnought would also reveal secrets about the American underwater fleet.
Britain began designing the ship in 1956 but got nowhere until the American government decided to end a ban on sharing military secrets with Britain that had been imposed after Fuchs blabbed.
The United States offered to supply a complete set of propelling equipment like that used in the Skipjack.
With the machinery went a complete design for the hull.
The Skipjack was a second generation atomic sub, much advanced on the Nautilus and the other four which preceded it.
Navy's future involved much of the navy's future depends upon her, an American naval announcement said on the Skipjack's first arrival in British waters in August, 1959, for exhibition to selected high officers at Portland underwater research station.
It was there that the two accused civil servants were at work.
Her basic hull form ( a teardrop ) and her nuclear power plant will be used for almost all new submarines, including the potent Polaris missile submarines, the statement went on.
The atom reactor, water cooled, was the result of almost a decade of research at the naval reactors branch of the atomic energy commission and Westinghouse Electric Corp..
Thru development, the reactor and its steam turbines had been reduced greatly in size, and also in complexity, allowing a single propeller to be used, the navy said.
The hull was also a result of almost a decade of work.
It was first tried out on a conventional submarine, the Albacore, in 1954.
The Skipjack became the fastest submarine ever built.
Reputedly it could outrun, underwater, the fastest destroyers.
It could, reputedly, go 70,000 miles without refueling and stay down more than a month.
It was of the hunter-killer type, designed to seek out ships and other submarines with its most advanced gear and destroy them with torpedoes.
The navy captain disclosed also that a list of questions found in Miss Gee's purse would, if completed and handed back, have given the Kremlin a complete picture of our current anti-submarine effort and would have shown what we are doing in research and development for the future.
Interested in detector the spy ring also was particularly interested in *j, the underwater equipment for detecting submarines, it was testified.
Range was a vital detail.
Designs of parts were sought.
Six radiomen told how, twice on two days after the ring was nabbed, a transmitter near Moscow was heard calling, using signals, times and wavelengths specified on codes found hidden in cigaret lighters in Lonsdale's apartment and the Krogers' house and also fastened to the transmitter lid.
Oddly, the calls were still heard 11 days after the five were arrested.
The charge that the federal indictment of three Chicago narcotics detail detectives is the product of rumor, combined with malice, and individual enmity on the part of the federal narcotics unit here was made yesterday in their conspiracy trial before Judge Joseph Sam Perry in federal District court.
The three -- Miles J. Cooperman, Sheldon Teller, and Richard Austin -- and eight other defendants are charged in six indictments with conspiracy to violate federal narcotic laws.
In his opening statement to a jury of eight women and four men, Bernard H. Sokol, attorney for the detectives, said that evidence would show that his clients were entirely innocent.
Had to know peddlers when they became members of the city police narcotics unit, Sokol said, they were told they would have to get to know certain areas of Chicago in which narcotics were sold and they would have to get to know people in the narcotics racket.
They, on occasion, posed as addicts and peddlers.
Although federal and city narcotic agents sometimes worked together, Sokol continued, rivalries developed when they were aiming at the same criminals.
This, he added, brought about petty jealousies and petty personal grievances.
In the same five year period that the United States says they ( the detectives ) were engaged in this conspiracy, Sokol continued, these three young men received a total of 26 creditable mentions and many special compensations, and were nominated for the Lambert Tree award and the mayor's medal.
No comments by U.*s. in opening, D. Arthur Connelly, assistant United States attorney, read the indictment, but made no comments.
Attorneys for the eight other defendants said only that there was no proof of their clients' guilt.
Cooperman and Teller are accused of selling $4,700 worth of heroin to a convicted narcotics peddler, Otis Sears, 45, of 6934 Indiana Av..
Among other acts, Teller and Austin are accused of paying $800 to Sears.
The first witness, Moses Winston Mardis, 5835 Michigan Av., a real estate agent and former bail bondsman, took the stand after opening statements had been made.
But court adjourned after he testified he introduced James White and Jeremiah Hope Pullings, two of the defendants, and also introduced Pullings to Jessy Maroy, a man mentioned in the indictment but not indicted.
Buaford Robinson, 23, of 7026 Stewart Av., a *j bus driver, was slugged and robbed last night by a group of youths at 51st Street and South Park Way.
Robinson was treated at a physician's office for a cut over his left eyebrow and a possible sprained knee.
His losses included his money bag, containing $40 to $50 and his $214 paycheck.
Robinson told Policemen James Jones and Morgan Lloyd of the Wabash Avenue district that 10 youths boarded his south bound express bus in front of Dunbar Vocational High School, 30th Street and South Park Way, and began skylarking.
When 51st Street was reached, Robinson related, he stopped the bus and told the youths he was going to call the *j supervisor.
As he left the bus with his money bag, Robinson added, the largest youth accosted him, a quarrel ensued, and the youth knocked him down.
Then the youths fled with his money.
Mrs. Blanche Dunkel, 60, who has spent 25 years in the Dwight reformatory for women for the murder in 1935 of her son-in-law, Ervin Lang, then 28, appealed for a parole at a hearing yesterday before two Illinois pardon and parole board members, John M. Bookwalter and Joseph Carpentier.
She had been sentenced to 180 years in prison, but former Gov. Stratton commuted her term to 75 years, making her eligible for parole, as one of his last acts in office.
Mrs. Dunkel admitted the slaying and said that the son-in-law became her lover after the death of her daughter in 1934.
It was when he attempted to end the relationship that the murder took place.
The son of a wealthy Evanston executive was fined $100 yesterday and forbidden to drive for 60 days for leading an Evanston policeman on a high speed chase over icy Evanston and Wilmette streets Jan. 20.
The defendant, William L. Stickney 3, 23, of 3211 Park pl., Evanston, who pleaded guilty to reckless driving, also was ordered by Judge James Corcoran to attend the Evanston traffic school each Tuesday night for one month.
Stickney is a salesman for Plee-*zing, Inc., 2544 Green Bay Rd., Evanston, a food brokerage and grocery chain firm, of which his father, William L. Jr., is president.
Patrolman James F. Simms said he started in pursuit when he saw young Stickney speeding north in Stewart Avenue at Central Street.
At Jenks Street, Simms said, the car skidded completely around, just missed two parked cars, and sped east in Jenks.
The car spun around again, Simms said, before Stickney could turn north in Prairie Avenue, and then violated two stop lights as he traveled north into Wilmette in Prairie.
St. Johns, Mich., April 19.
-- a jury of seven men and five women found 21-year-old Richard Pohl guilty of manslaughter yesterday in the bludgeon slaying of Mrs. Anna Hengesbach.
Pohl received the verdict without visible emotion.
He returned to his cell in the county jail, where he has been held since his arrest last July, without a word to his court-appointed attorney, Jack Walker, or his guard.
Stepson vindicated the verdict brought vindication to the dead woman's stepson, Vincent Hengesbach, 54, who was tried for the same crime in December, 1958, and released when the jury failed to reach a verdict.
Mrs. Hengesbach was killed on Aug. 31, 1958.
Hengesbach has been living under a cloud ever since.
When the verdict came in against his young neighbor, Hengesbach said : I am very pleased to have the doubt of suspicion removed.
Still, I don't wish to appear happy at somebody else's misfortune.
Lives on welfare Hengesbach, who has been living on welfare recently, said he hopes to rebuild the farm which was settled by his grandfather in Westphalia, 27 miles southwest of here.
Hengesbach has been living in Grand Ledge since his house and barn were burned down after his release in 1958.
Pohl confessed the arson while being questioned about several fires in the Westphalia area by State Police.
He also admitted killing Mrs. Hengesbach.
However, the confession, which was the only evidence against him, was retracted before the trial.
Charges in doubt assistant Prosecutor Fred Lewis, who tried both the Hengesbach and Pohl cases, said he did not know what would be done about two arson charges pending against Pohl.
Circuit Judge Paul R. Cash did not set a date for sentencing.
Pohl could receive from 1 to 15 years in prison or probation.
Walker said he was considering filing a motion for a new trial which would contend that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that there were several errors in trial procedure.
Locked in motel a verdict against Pohl came at 05 p.m. after almost 13-1/2 hours of deliberation.
The jury, which was locked up in a motel overnight, was canvassed at the request of Walker after the verdict was announced.
The jury foreman, Mrs. Olive Heideman, of rural Elsie, said that a ballot was not even taken until yesterday morning and that the first day of deliberation was spent in going over the evidence.
She said the jurors agreed that Pohl's confession was valid.
The jury asked Judge Cash to send in his written definition of the difference between first and second-degree murder and manslaughter.
The verdict came three hours later.
Some 30 spectators remained in the court during the day and were on hand to hear the verdict read.
The trial had packed the large courtroom for more than a week.
A Sterling Township family of six surviving children, whose mother died yesterday as the aftermath to a fire that also killed one of the children, found today they had the help of hundreds of neighbors and school friends.
While neighbor women assumed some of the dead mother's duties, fund-raising events were being planned by a homeowners association and a student council for the hard-hit Henry Kowalski family, 34220 Viceroy.
Mrs. Eleanor Kowalski, 42, died yesterday afternoon in Holy Cross Hospital of burns suffered in a fire that followed a bottled gas explosion Saturday night at the flat of her widowed mother, Mrs. Mary Pankowski, in the adjoining suburb of Warren.
Services tomorrow funeral services for Mrs. Kowalski and her daughter, Christine, 11, who died of burns at the same hospital Monday, have been scheduled for 10 a.m. tomorrow in St. Anne's Catholic Church, 31978 Mound, in Warren.
The mother and daughter, who will be buried side by side in Mt. Olivet Cemetery, rested together today in closed caskets at the Lyle Elliott Funeral Home, 31730 Mound, Warren.
Mrs. Pankowski, 61, remained in Holy Cross Hospital as a result of the explosion, which occurred while Mrs. Kowalski fueled a cook stove in the grandmother's small upstairs flat at 2274 Eight Mile Road East.
Held candle assistant Fire Chief Chester Cornell said gas fumes apparently were ignited by a candle which one of the three Kowalski girls present held for her mother, because the flat lacked electricity.
Christine's twin sister, Patricia, and Darlene Kowalski, 8, escaped with minor burns.
They are home now with the other Kowalski children, Vicky, 14 ; Dennis, 6 ; Eleanor, 2 ; and Bernardine, 1.
All we have left in the world is one another, and we must stay together the way Mother wanted, Kowalski said in telling his children of their mother's death yesterday afternoon.
Kowalski, a roofer who seldom worked last winter, already was in arrears on their recently purchased split-level home when the tragedy staggered him with medical and funeral bills.
$135 donated neighbor women, such as Mrs. Sidney Baker, 2269 Serra, Sterling Township, have been supplying the family with meals and handling household chores with Kowalski's sister-in-law, Mrs. Anna Kowalski, 22111 David, East Detroit.
Another neighbor, Mrs. Frank C. Smith, 2731 Pall Mall, Sterling Township, surprised Kowalski by coming to the home yesterday with $135 collected locally toward the $400 funeral costs.
John C. Houghton, president of the Tareytown Acres Homeowners Association, followed that by announcing plans last night for a door-to-door fund drive throughout their subdivision on behalf of the Kowalski family.
Students help out Houghton said 6 p.m. Friday had been set for a canvass of all 480 homes in the subdivision, which is located northeast of Dequindre and 14 Mile Road East.
He said contributions also could be mailed to Post Office Box 553, Warren Village Station.
Vicky Kowalski meanwhile learned that several of her fellow students had collected almost $25 for her family during the lunch hour yesterday at Fuhrmann Junior High School, 5155 Fourteen Mile road east.
Principal Clayton W. Pohly said he would allow a further collection between classes today, and revealed that *j Club past surpluses had been used to provide a private hospital nurse Monday for Mrs. Kowalski.
Funds from dances student Council officers announced today the Kowalski family would be given the combined proceeds from a school dance held two weeks ago, and another dance for Fuhrmann's 770 students this Friday night.
Furhmann's faculty is proud that this has been a spontaneous effort, started largely among the students themselves, because of fondness for Vicky and sympathy for her entire family, Pohly said.
There also were reports of a collection at the County Line Elementary School, 3505o Dequindre, which has been attended this year by four of the Kowalski children including Christine.
Expresses thanks Kowalski has spoken but little since the fire last Saturday.
But today he wanted to make a public statement.
I never knew there were such neighbors and friends around me and my family.
I wasn't sure there were such people anywhere in the world.
I'll need more than a single day to find the words to properly express my thanks to them.
An alert 10-year-old safety patrol boy was congratulated by police today for his part in obtaining a reckless driving conviction against a youthful motorist.
Patrolman George Kimmell, of Mc*clellan Station, said he would recommend a special safety citation for Ralph Sisk, 9230 Vernor east, a third grader at the Scripps School, for his assistance in the case.
Kimmell said he and Ralph were helping children across Belvidere at Kercheval Monday afternoon when a car heading north on Belvidere stopped belatedly inside the pedestrian crosswalk.
Gets car number Kimmell ordered the driver to back up, watched the children safely across and was approaching the car when it suddenly took off at high speed, he said, narrowly missing him.
Commandeering a passing car, Kimmell pursued the fleeing vehicle, but lost it in traffic.
Returning to the school crossing, the officer was informed by the Sisk boy that he recognized the driver, a neighbor, and had obtained the license number.
The motorist later was identified as Richard Sarkees, 17, of 2433 Mc*clellan, currently on probation and under court order not to drive.
Given 15 days he was found guilty of reckless driving yesterday by Traffic Judge George T. Murphy, who continued his no-driving probation for another year and ordered him to spend 15 days in the Detroit House of Correction.
The jail sentence is to begin the day after Sarkees graduates from Eastern High School in June.
The long crisis in Laos appeared nearing a showdown today.
Britain announced that it is asking the Soviet Union to agree tomorrow to an immediate cease-fire.
Help asked in Vientiane, the royal Laotian government decided today to ask its friends and neighbors for help in fighting what it called a new rebel offensive threatening the southeast Asian kingdom.
Britain's plans to press Russia for a definite cease-fire timetable was announced in London by Foreign Secretary Lord Home.
He said Britain also proposed that the international truce commission should be reconvened, sent to New Delhi and from there to Laos to verify the cease-fire.
A 14-power conference on Laos should then meet on May 5, he said.
Plea for arms the Laos government plea for help was made by Foreign Minister Tiao Sopsaisana.
He indicated that requests would be made for more U.*s. arms and more U.*s. military advisers.
He declared the government is thinking of asking for foreign troops if the situation worsens.
One of the first moves made after a cabinet decision was to request the United States to establish a full-fledged military assistance group instead of the current civilian body.
A note making the request was handed to U.*s. Ambassador Winthrop G. Brown.
Heavy support the Laos government said four major Pathet Lao rebel attacks had been launched, heavily supported by troops from Communist North Viet Nam.
The minister, describing the attacks which led up to the appeal, said that 60,000 Communist North Vietnamese were fighting royal army troops on one front -- near Thakhek, in southern-central Laos.
There was no confirmation of such massive assaults from independent sources.
In the past such government claims have been found exaggerated.
Havana, April 19.
-- two Americans and seven Cubans were executed by firing squads today as Castro military tribunals began decreeing the death penalty for captured invasion forces and suspected collaborators.
A Havana radio broadcast identified the Americans as Howard Anderson and August Jack Mc*nair.
The executions took place at dawn only a few hours after Havana radio announced their conviction by a revolutionary tribunal at Pinar Del Rio, where the executions took place.
Arms plot charged the broadcast said Anderson, a Seattle ex-marine and Havana businessman, and Mc*nair, of Miami, were condemned on charges of smuggling arms to Cuban rebels.
Anderson operated three Havana automobile service stations and was commander of the Havana American Legion post before it disbanded since the start of Fidel Castro's regime.
Anderson's wife and four children live in Miami.
Mc*nair, 25, was seized March 20 with four Cubans and accused of trying to land a boatload of rifles in Pinar Del Rio, about 35 miles from Havana.
Report others held at least 20 other Americans were reported to have been arrested in a mass political roundup.
Among them were a number of newsmen, including Henry Raymont, of United Press International, and Robert Berrellez, of Associated Press.
So many Cubans were reported being swept into the Castro dragnet that the massive Sports Palace auditorium and at least one hotel were converted into makeshift jails.
More than 1,000 were said to have been arrested -- 100 of them Roman Catholic priests.
Of the millions who have served time in concentration camps in Siberia as political prisoners of the Soviet state, few emerge in the West to tell about it.
M. Kegham -- the name is a pseudynom -- was a teacher in Bucharest and a member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( A*r*f ) -- two reasons the Communists put him away when they arrived in 1945.
Today, M. Kegham was in Detroit, en route to join his wife and children in California.
Emory University's Board of Trustees announced Friday that it was prepared to accept students of any race as soon as the state's tax laws made such a step possible.
Emory University's charter and by-laws have never required admission or rejection of students on the basis of race, board chairman Henry L. Bowden stated.
But an official statement adopted by the 33-man Emory board at its annual meeting Friday noted that state taxing requirements at present are a roadblock to accepting Negroes.
The statement explained that under the Georgia Constitution and state law, tax-exempt status is granted to educational institutions only if they are segregated.
Emory could not continue to operate according to its present standards as an institution of higher learning, of true university grade, and meet its financial obligations, without the tax-exemption privileges which are available to it only so long as it conforms to the aforementioned constitutional and statutory provisions, the statement said.
The statement did not mention what steps might be taken to overcome the legal obstacles to desegregation.
An Emory spokesman indicated, however, that the university itself did not intend to make any test of the laws.
The Georgia Constitution gives the Legislature the power to exempt colleges from property taxation if, among other criteria, all endowments to institutions established for white people shall be limited to white people, and all endowments to institutions established for colored people shall be limited to colored people.
At least two private colleges in the Atlanta area now or in the past have had integrated student bodies, but their tax-exempt status never has been challenged by the state.
Emory is affiliated with the Methodist Church.
Some church leaders, both clerical and lay, have criticized the university for not taking the lead in desegregation.
Urged in 1954 the student newspaper, The Emory Wheel, as early as the fall of 1954 called for desegregation.
From its beginning, the trustees' statement said Friday, Emory University has assumed as its primary commitment a dedication to excellence in Christian higher learning.
Teaching, research and study, according to highest standards, under Christian influence, are paramount in the Emory University policy.
As a private institution, supported by generous individuals, Emory University will recognize no obligation and will adopt no policy that would conflict with its purpose to promote excellence in scholarship and Christian education.
There is not now, nor has there ever been in Emory University's charter or by-laws any requirement that students be admitted or rejected on the basis of race, color or creed.
Insofar as its own governing documents are concerned, Emory University could now consider applications from prospective students, and others seeking applications from prospective students, and others seeking the opportunity to study or work at the university, irrespective of race, color or creed.
Corporate existence on the other hand, Emory University derives its corporate existence from the State of Georgia.
When and if it can do so without jeopardizing constitutional and statutory tax-exemption privileges essential to the maintenance of its educational program and facilities, Emory University will consider applications of persons desiring to study or work at the University without regard to race, color or creed, continuing university policy that all applications shall be considered on the basis of intellectual and moral standards and other criteria designed to assure the orderly and effective conduct of the university and the fulfillment of its mission as an institution of Christian higher education.
A young man was killed and two others injured at midnight Friday when the car they were riding slid into a utility pole on Lake Avenue near Waddell Street, *j, police said.
The dead youth was identified as Robert E. Sims, 19, of 1688 Oak Knoll Cir., *j.
Patrolman G. E. Hammons said the car evidently slid out of control on rain-slick streets and slammed into the pole.
The other occupants were James Willard Olvey, 18, of 963 Ponce De Leon Ave., *j, and Larry Coleman Barnett, 19, of 704 Hill St., *j, both of whom were treated at Grady Hospital for severe lacerations and bruises.
The Atlanta Negro student movement renewed its demands for movie theater integration Friday and threatened picketing and stand-ins if negotiations failed.
The demands were set forth in letters to seven owners of first-run theaters by the Committee on Appeal for Human Rights.
Intend to attend we intend to attend the downtown theaters before the first of the year, the identically worded letters said.
The letters set a Nov. 15 deadline for the start of negotiations.
They indicated that stand-ins and picketing would be started if theater owners failed to cooperate.
Downtown and art theater managers and owners, contacted Friday night for comment on the *j request, said they had no knowledge of such a letter, and that it was not in the Friday mail.
However, three of the managers did say that they would agree to attend the proposed meeting if all of the other managers decided to attend.
Gather here the *j letter comes on the eve of a large gathering of theater managers and owners scheduled to begin here Sunday.
Several theater operators said, however, that there is little likelihood of the subject being discussed during the three-day affair.
Student leaders began sporadic efforts to negotiate theater integration several months ago.
Charles A. Black, *j chairman, said Friday that three theater representatives had agreed to meet with the students on Oct. 31 but had failed to show up.
He declined to name the three.
Friday's letters asked for a Nov. 15 meeting.
Failure to attend the meeting or explain inability to attend, the letters said, would be considered a sign of indifference.
Black said *j hoped to be able to integrate the theaters without taking direct action, but we are pledged to using every legal and nonviolent means at our disposal a prepared statement released by the student group Friday stated that extensive research by *j into techniques and methods of theater integration in other cities indicated that the presence of picket lines and stand-ins before segregated theaters causes a drop in profits besides managers of downtown theaters, the students sent letters to owners of art theaters in the uptown area and Buckhead.

A 24-year-old Atlanta man was arrested Sunday after breaking into the home of relatives in search of his wife, hitting his uncle with a rock and assaulting two police officers who tried to subdue him, police said.
Patrolmen J. W. Slate and A. L. Crawford Jr. said they arrested Ronald M. Thomas, of 1671 Nakoma St., *j, after he assaulted the officers.
Police account the officers gave this account : Thomas early Sunday went to the home of his uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. R. C. Thomas, 511 Blanche St., *j, looking for his wife, Margaret Lou Thomas, 18, and their 11-month-old baby.
The younger Thomas ripped a screen door, breaking the latch, and after an argument struck his uncle with a rock, scratching his face.
He also struck his aunt and wife, and during the melee the baby also suffered scratches.
When police arrived the man was still violent, Slate said.
Attacks officer he attacked one of the officers and was restrained.

Georgia's Department of Agriculture is intensifying its fire ant eradication program in an effort to stay ahead of the fast-spreading pest.
The department is planning to expand its eradication program soon to four additional counties -- Troup, Pierce, Bryan and Bulloch -- to treat 132,000 acres infested by the ants, according to W. E. Blasingame state entomologist.
Low-flying planes will spread a granular-type chemical, heptachlor, over 30,000 acres in Troup, 37,000 acres in Pierce and 65,000 acres in Bulloch and Bryan counties.
The eradication effort is being pushed in Bibb and Jones counties, over 37,679 acres.
The department has just finished treating 20,000 acres in urban areas of Macon.
Also being treated are Houston, Bleckley, Tift, Turner and Dodge counties, Blasingame said.
The fire ant is thought to infest approximately two million acres of land in Georgia, attacking crops, young wildlife and livestock and can be a serious health menace to humans who are allergic to its venom, Blasingame said.
The north-bound entrance to the Expressway at 14th Street will be closed during the afternoon rush traffic hours this week.
This is being done so that Georgia Tech can complete the final phase of a traffic survey on the North Expressway.
Students have been using electric computers and high speed movie cameras during the study.
Perhaps the engineers can find out what causes all the congestion and suggest methods to eliminate it.
Incidentally, 14th Street and the Expressway is the high accident intersection during daylight hours.
It is followed by Cain Street and Piedmont Avenue, *j ; the junction of the Northeast and Northwest Expressways and Jones Avenue and Marietta Street, *j.

Salem ( special ) -- for a second month in a row, Multnomah County may be short of general assistance money in its budget to handle an unusually high summer month's need, the state public welfare commission was told Friday.
It is the only county in the state so far this month reporting a possible shortage in *j category, for which emergency allotment can be given by the state if necessary.
William Smythe, director of field service, told the commissioners that Multnomah, as of Aug. 22, had spent $58,918 out of its budgeted $66,000 in the category, leaving only $7,082 for the rest of the month.
At the rate of need indicated in the early weeks of the month, this could mean a shortage of as high as $17,000.
But it probably will be less because of a usual slackening during the last weeks of each month, Smythe said.
No request for emergency allotment had yet been received, however.
Board oks pact the commission, meeting for the first time with both of its newly-appointed commissioners, Roy Webster, of Hood River, and Dr. Ennis Keizer, of North Bend, approved a year's contract for a consultant in the data processing department who has been the center of considerable controversy in the past.
The contract with Ray Field, who has been converting the agencies electronic data processing program to magnetic tape, would renew his present salary of $8 an hour up to a maximum of 200 hours a month.
Field does the planning for the machine operations and fiscal processes and the adapting of the data processing system to new programs as they are made necessary by legislative and policy changes.
Acting Administrator Andrew F. Juras said that because of Field's unique position and knowledge in the program, the agency now would be seriously handicapped if he was not continued for a period.
But he emphasized that the agency must train people within its own employ to fulfill what Field handles, and he said he personally regrets very much that the agency has not done this in the past.
He pointed out to the commissioners that the agency was literally dependent now on the machine processing, and the whole wheels of the agency would stop if it broke down or the three or four persons directing it were to leave.
Salary termed modest Juras said he insisted Field be continued on a consultant basis only and be answerable directly to the administrator of the agency and not to other agencies of the government.
He also said that the salary, in terms of going rates in the field, was modest in terms of the man's responsibility.
The conversion to magnetic tape is not yet completed, he said, and added Field's long service in state government and welfare employ gave him familiarity with the welfare program.
Do you feel you can stand up to the next legislative session and defend this contract?
Asked Mrs. Grace O. Peck, representative from Multnomah County, of the commission chairman, Joseph E. Harvey Jr..
My feeling at the moment, he said, is that we have no alternative, irrespective of some of the arguments about him.
The continued operation of this program depends on having his service.
Harvey criticized Mrs. Peck, later joined by the commission's vice-chairman, Mrs. Lee Patterson, took Harvey to task for comments he had made to the North Portland Rotary Club Tuesday.
A publicity release from Oregon Physicians Service, of which Harvey is president, quoted him as saying the welfare office move to Salem, instead of crippling the agency, had provided an avenue to correct administrative weaknesses, with the key being improved communications between *j & *j and the commission staff.
I rather resent, she said, you speaking to those groups in Portland as though just the move accomplished this.
I think you fell short of the real truth in the matter : that the move is working out through the fine cooperation of the staff and all the people.
The staff deserves a lot of credit working down here under real obstacles.
Harvey said his objective was to create a better public image for welfare.
The wife of convicted bank robber Lawrence G. Huntley was arrested in Phoenix, Ariz., last week and will be returned to Portland to face charges of assault and robbery, Portland detectives said Friday.

About 70 North Providence taxpayers made appeals to the board of tax assessors for a review of their 1961 tax assessments during the last two days at the town hall in Centredale.
These were the last two days set aside by the board for hearing appeals.
Appeals were heard for two days two weeks ago.
About 75 persons appeared at that time.
Louis H. Grenier, clerk of the board, said that the appeals will be reviewed in December at the time the board is visiting new construction sites in the town for assessment purposes.
They also will visit properties on which appeals have been made.
Any adjustments which are made, Mr. Grenier said earlier this month, will appear on the balance of the tax bill since most of the town's taxpayers take the option of paying quarterly with the balance due next year.

A 62-year-old Smithfield man, Lester E. Stone of 19 Beverly Circle, was in satisfactory condition last night at Our Lady of Fatima Hospital, North Providence, with injuries suffered when a car he was driving struck a utility pole on Woonasquatucket Avenue in North Providence near Stevens Street.

The fight over the Warwick School Committee's appointment of a coordinator of audio-visual education may go to the state Supreme Court, it appeared last night.
Two members of the Democratic-endorsed majority on the school board said they probably would vote to appeal a ruling by the state Board of Education, which said yesterday that the school committee acted improperly in its appointment of the coordinator, Francis P. Nolan 3rd, the Democratic-endorsed committee chairman, could not be reached for comment.
In its ruling, the state Board of Education upheld Dr. Michael F. Walsh, state commissioner of education, who had ruled previously that the Warwick board erred when it named Maurice F. Tougas as coordinator of audio-visual education without first finding that the school superintendent's candidate was not suitable.
Supt. Clarence S. Taylor had recommended Roger I. Vermeersch for the post.
Milton and Rosella Lovett of Cranston were awarded $55,000 damages from the state in Superior Court yesterday for industrial property which they owned at 83 Atwells Ave., Providence, and which was condemned for use in construction of Interstate Route 95.
The award was made by Judge Fred B. Perkins who heard their petition without a jury by agreement of the parties.
The award, without interest, compared with a valuation of $57,500 placed on the property by the property owners' real estate expert, and a valuation of $52,500 placed on it by the state's expert.
The property included a one-story brick manufacturing building on 8,293 square feet of land.
Saul Hodosh represented the owners.
Atty. Gen. J. Joseph Nugent appeared for the state.
Santa's lieutenants in charge of the Journal-*bulletin Santa Claus Fund are looking for the usual generous response this year from Cranston residents.
Persons who find it convenient may send their contributions to the Journal-*bulletin's Cranston office at 823 Park Avenue.
All contributed will be acknowledged.
The fund's statewide quota this year is $8,250 to provide Christmas gifts for needy youngsters.
Scores of Cranston children will be remembered.
Cranston residents have been generous contributors to the fund over the years.
Public school children have adopted the fund as one of their favorite Christmas charities and their pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters aid greatly in helping Santa to reach the fund's goal.
Bernard Parrillo, 20, of 19 Fletcher Ave., Cranston, was admitted to Roger Williams Hospital shortly before 11:30 a.m. yesterday after a hunting accident in which a shotgun he was carrying discharged against his heel.
Mr. Parrillo was given first aid at Johnston Hose 1.
( Thornton ) where he had been driven by a companion.
The two had been hunting in the Simmonsville area of town and Mr. Parrillo dropped the gun which fired as it struck the ground.
Hospital officials said the injury was severe but the youth was in good condition last night.
A check for $4, 177.37 representing the last payment of a $50,000 federal grant to Rhode Island Hospital was presented to the hospital administrator, Oliver G. Pratt, yesterday by Governor Notte.
The hospital has used the money to assist in alterations on the fifth floor of the Jane Brown Hospital, part of Rhode Island Hospital.
The work added eight beds to the hospital, giving it a total capacity of 646 general beds.
Vincent Sorrentino, founder and board chairman of the Uncas Mfg. Co., has been designated a Cavaliere of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Italy.
The decoration will be presented by A. Trichieri, Italian consul general in Boston, at a ceremony at 30 p.m. on Dec. 7 at the plant, which this year is celebrating its golden anniversary.
About 500 employes of the firm will be on hand to witness bestowal of the honor upon Mr. Sorrentino.
Mr. Sorrentino will be honored on the evening of Dec. 7 at a dinner to be given by the Aurora Club at the Sheraton-*biltmore Hotel.
The Newport-based destroyer picket escort Kretchmer has arrived back at Newport after three months' patrol in North Atlantic waters marked by mercy jobs afloat and ashore.
On Sept. 6, the Kretchmer rescued the crew of a trawler they found drifting on a life raft after they had abandoned a sinking ship.
In August while stopping in Greenock, Scotland, three members of the crew on liberty rendered first aid to a girl who fell from a train.
Local authorities credited the men with saving the girl's life.
Birmingham, Ala. -- ( A*p ) -- the *j yesterday arrested on a perjury charge one of the members of the jury that failed to reach a verdict in the Freedom Rider bus burning trial four weeks ago.
U.*s. Attorney Macon Weaver said the federal complaint, charged that the juror gave false information when asked about Ku Klux Klan membership during selection of jury.
He identified the man as Lewis Martin Parker, 59, a farmer of Hartselle, Ala..
Eight men were tried together in U.*s. District Court in Anniston, Ala., on charges of interfering with interstate transportation and conspiracy growing out of a white mob's attack on a Greyhound bus carrying the first of the Freedom Riders.
The bus was burned outside Anniston.
One of the eight defendants was freed on a directed verdict of acquittal.
A mistrial was declared in the case against the other seven when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict.
The arrest of Mr. Parker marks the third charge of wrongdoing involving the jury that heard the case.
The first incident occurred before the trial got under way when Judge H. Hobart Grooms told the jury panel he had heard reports of jury-tampering efforts.
He asked members of the panel to tell him if anyone outside the court had spoken to them about the case.
Two members of the panel later told in court about receiving telephone calls at their homes from anonymous persons expressing interest in the trial.
Neither was seated on the jury.
Then, when the case went to the jury, the judge excused one of the jurors, saying the juror had told him he had been accosted by masked men at his motel the night before the trial opened.
The juror said the masked men had advised him to be lenient.
The judge replaced the juror with an alternate.
No formal charges have been filed as a result of either of the two reported incidents.
At the opening of the trial, the jury panel was questioned as a group by Mr. Weaver about Ku Klux Klan connections.
One member of the panel -- not Mr. Parker -- indicated he had been a member of the *j at one time.
He was not seated on the jury.
The perjury charge against Mr. Parker carries a maximum penalty of $2,000 fine and five years imprisonment on conviction.
New York -- ( U*p*i ) -- the New York University Board of Trustees has elected the youngest president in the 130-year history of *j, it was announced yesterday.
The new president is 37-year-old Dr. James Mc*n. Hester, currently dean of the *j Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.
He will take over his new post Jan. 1.
Dr. Hester, also one of the youngest men ever to head a major American university, succeeds Dr. Carroll V. Newsom who resigned last September to join Prentice-*hall Inc. publishing firm.
Dr. Hester, of Princeton, N.*j., is a native of Chester, Pa. he joined *j in September, 1960.
Prior to that he was associated with Long Island University in Brooklyn.
Asilomar, March 26 vast spraying programs conducted by technicians with narrow training and little wisdom are endangering crops and wildlife, Carl W. Buchheister, president of the National Audubon Society, said today.
It is like handing a loaded.45
Automatic to an 8-year-old and telling him to run out and play, he commented.
Buchheister told delegates to the West Coast Audubon Convention that aerial spraying in Louisiana failed to destroy its target, the fire ant.
But it did destroy the natural controls of a borer and released a new plague that wrecked a sugar cane crop, he said.
The conservation leader said other mistakes in spraying had caused serious damage in Ohio and Wyoming.
There have even been serious errors in the U. S. Forest Service, whose officials pride themselves in their scientific training, he added.
The news of their experiments reaches the farmers who, forgetting that birds are the most efficient natural enemies of insects and rodents, are encouraged to try to get rid of all birds that occasionally peck their grapes or their blueberries, Buchheister told the delegates.
In addition to urging greater restrictions on aerial spraying, Buchheister called for support of the Wilderness bill, creation of national seashore parks, including Point Reyes ; preservation of the wetlands where birds breed ; a pesticides co-ordination act ; stronger water pollution control programs, and Federal ratification of an international convention to halt pollution of the sea by oil.
The Reed Rogers Da Fonta Wild Life Sanctuary in Marin county on Friday officially became the property of the National Audubon Society.
Mrs. Norman Livermore, president of the Marin Conservation League, handed over the deed to the 645-acre tidelands tract south of Greenwood Beach to Carl W. Buchheister, president of the Society.
The presentation was made before several hundred persons at the annual meeting of the League at Olney Hall, College of Marin, Kentfield.
Buchheister pledged the land would be an inviolate sanctuary for all birds, animals and plants.
Seventeen years ago today, German scientist Willy Fiedler climbed into a makeshift cockpit installed in a *j rocket-bomb that was attached to the underbelly of a Heinkel bomber.
The World War 2 German bomber rolled down a runway and took off.
The only way Fiedler could get back to earth alive was to fly the pulse jet missile and land it on the airstrip.
This had never been done before.
Now a quiet-spoken, middle-aged man, Fiedler is an aeronautical engineer for Lockheed's Missiles and Space Division at Sunnyvale, where he played a key role in the development of the Navy's Polaris missile.
He sat in his office yesterday and recalled that historic flight in 1944.
The first two pilots had crashed, he said.
I had developed the machines and therefore knew them.
It was time to go up myself.
Fiedler was then technical director of Hitler's super-secret Reichenberg project, which remained unknown to the Allies until after the war.
About 200 of the special *j rocket-bombs were to be made ready for manned flight with an explosive warhead.
The target was Allied shipping -- a desperate effort to stave off the Allied invasion of Europe.
The success of the project depended upon Fiedler's flight.
Squeezed into the few cubic feet normally filled by the rocket's automatic guidance mechanism, the scientist waited while the bomber gained altitude.
At 12,000 feet, Fiedler signaled release, and started the roaring pulse-jet engine -- then streaked away from beneath the Heinkel.
To the German pilot in the bomber the rocket became a faint black speck, hurtling through the sky at the then incredible speed of 420 m.p.h..
It was probably man's first successful flight in a missile.
She flew beautifully, said Fiedler.
There was only one power control -- a valve to adjust the fuel flow.
I had exactly 20 minutes to get down to the test strip.
Using a steering system that controlled the modified rocket's tail surfaces and wings equipped with ailerons, Fiedler was to land the missile on a skid especially bolted under the fuselage.
He managed to maneuver the missile to a landing speed of 200 m.p.h. -- fast even for a modern jet plane touchdown -- and banked into the airfield.
Moments later the *j skimmed across the landing strip, edging closer and closer to a touchdown -- then in a streamer of dust it landed.
Fiedler went on to make several other test flights before German pilots took over the Reichenberg missiles.
The missiles were to be armed with an underwater bomb.
Pilots would steer them in a suicide dive into the water, striking below the waterline of individual ships.
A crack corps of 50 pilots was formed from the ranks of volunteers, but the project was halted before the end of the war, and the missiles later fell into Allied hands.
Now a family man with three children, Fiedler lives in a quiet residential area near the Lockheed plant at Sunnyvale.
His spare time is spent in soaring gliders.
It's so quiet, he said, so slow, serene -- and so challenging.
John Di Massimo has been elected president of the 1961 Columbus Day Celebration Committee, it was announced yesterday.
Other officers are Angelo J. Scampini, vice president, Joseph V. Arata, treasurer, and Fred J. Casassa, secretary.
Judge John B. Molinari was named chairman of the executive committee.
Elected to the board of directors were : Elios P. Anderlini, Attilio Beronio, Leo M. Bianco, Frederic Campagnoli, Joseph Cervetto, Armond J. De Martini, Grace Duhagon, John P. Figone, John P. Figone Jr., Stephen Mana, John Moscone, Calude Perasso, Angelo Petrini, Frank Ratto, and George R. Reilly.
Dr. Albert Schweitzer, world-famous theologian and medical missionary, has endorsed an Easter March for Disarmament which begins tomorrow in Sunnyvale.
Members of the San Francisco American Friends Service, a Quaker organization, will march to San Francisco for a rally in Union Square at 2 p.m. Saturday.
In a letter to the American Friends Service, Dr. Schweitzer wrote : leading nations of the West and of the East keep busy making newer nuclear weapons to defend themselves in the event the constantly threatening nuclear war should break out.
They cannot do otherwise than live in dread of each other since these weapons imply the possibility of such grisly surprise attack.
The only way out of this state of affairs is agreement to abolish nuclear weapons ; otherwise no peace is possible.
Governments apparently do not feel obligated to make the people adequately aware of this danger ; therefore we need guardians to demonstrate against the ghastly stupidity of nuclear weapons and jolt the people out of their complacency.
A federal grand jury called 10 witnesses yesterday in an investigation of the affairs of Ben Stein, 47, who collected big fees as a labor consultant and operator of a janitors' service.
Before he testified for 20 minutes, Stein, who lives at 3300 Lake Shore Dr., admitted to reporters that he had a wide acquaintance with crime syndicate hoodlums.
Glimco a buddy among his gangland buddies, he said, were Joseph ( Joey ) Glimco, a mob labor racketeer, and four gang gambling chiefs, Gus ( Slim ) Alex, Ralph Pierce, Joe ( Caesar ) Di*varco, and Jimmy ( Monk ) Allegretti.
Another hoodlum, Louis Arger, drew $39,000 from Stein's janitor firm, the National Maintenance company, in three years ending in 1959, Stein disclosed in an interview.
I put Arger on the payroll because he promised to get my firm the stevedore account at Navy pier, Stein said.
But Arger never was able to produce it, so I cut him off my payroll.
Connection is sought other witnesses, after appearances before the jury, which reportedly is probing into possible income tax violations, disclosed that government prosecutors were attempting to connect Stein and his company with a number of gangsters, including Glimco and Alex.
The federal lawyers, according to their witnesses, also were tracing Stein's fees as a labor consultant.
Under scrutiny, two of the witnesses said, were payments and loans to Stein's National Maintenance company at 543 Madison St..
The company supplies janitors and workmen for Mc*cormick Place and factories, liquor firms, and other businesses.
Lee a witness among the witnesses were Ed J. Lee, director of Mc*cormick Place ; Jerome Leavitt, a partner in the Union Liquor company, 3247 S. Kedzie Av., Dominic Senese, a teamster union slugger who is a buddy of Stein and a cousin of Tony Accardo, onetime gang chief ; and Frank W. Pesce, operator of a Glimco dominated deodorant firm, the Best Sanitation and Supply company, 1215 Blue Island Av..
Lee said he had told the jury that he made an agreement in April with Stein to supply and supervise janitors in Mc*cormick Place.
Stein's fee, Lee said, was 10 per cent of the janitors' pay.
Stein estimated this amount at about $1,500 or $1,600 a month.
A $12,500 payment Leavitt, as he entered the jury room, said he was prepared to answer questions about the $12,500 his liquor firm paid to Stein for labor consultant work with five unions which organized Leavitt's workers.
Leavitt identified the unions as a warehouseman's local, the teamsters union, a salesman's union, the janitors' union, and a bottling workers' union.
Government attorneys, Leavitt said, have questioned him closely about five or six loans totaling about $40,000 which the liquor company made to Stein in the last year.
All of the loans, in amounts up to $5,000 each, have been repaid by Stein, according to Leavitt.
Stein said he needed the money, Leavitt said, to meet the payroll at National Maintenance company.
The deodorant firm run by Pesce has offices in the headquarters of Glimco's discredited taxi drivers' union at 1213-15 Blue Island Av..
The radiation station of the Chicago board of health recorded a reading of 1 micro-microcurie of radiation per cubic meter of air over Chicago yesterday.
The reading, which has been watched with interest since Russia's detonation of a super bomb Monday, was 4 on Tuesday and 7 last Saturday, a level far below the danger point, according to the board of health.
The weather bureau has estimated that radioactive fallout from the test might arrive here next week.
A board of health spokesman said there is no reason to believe that an increase in the level here will occur as a result of the detonation.
Curtis Allen Huff, 41, of 1630 Lake Av., Wilmette, was arrested yesterday on a suppressed federal warrant charging him with embezzling an undetermined amount of money from the First Federal Savings and Loan association, 1 S. Dearborn St., where he formerly was employed as an attorney.
Federal prosecutors estimated that the amount may total $20,000, altho a spokesman for the association estimated its loss at approximately $10,000.
Lien payments involved Huff's attorney, Antone F. Gregorio, quoted his client as saying that part of the embezzlement represented money paid to Huff, as attorney for the loan association, in satisfaction of mechanic's liens on property on which the association held mortgages.
Huff told Gregorio that he took the money to pay the ordinary bills and expenses of suburban living.
Huff, who received a salary of $109 a week from the loan association from October of 1955 until September of this year, said that his private practice was not lucrative.
Huff lives with his wife, Sue, and their four children, 6 to 10 years old, in a $25,000 home with a $17,000 mortgage.
Charge lists 3 checks the complaint on which the warrant was issued was filed by Leo Blaber, an attorney for the association.
The shortage was discovered after Huff failed to report for work on Sept. 18.
On that date, according to Gregorio, Huff left his home and took a room in the New Lawrence hotel at 1020 Lawrence Av..
There, Gregorio said, Huff wrote a complete statement of his offense.
Later, Huff cashed three checks for $100 each at the Sherman House, using a credit card.
All bounced.
When Huff attempted to cash another $100 check there Monday, hotel officials called police.
Bonn, Oct. 24 ( U*p*i ) -- Greece and West Germany have ratified an agreement under which Germany will pay $28,700,000 to Greek victims of Nazi persecution, it was announced today.
Probably the hottest thing that has hit the Dallas investment community in years was the Morton Foods stock issue, which was sold to the public during the past week.
For many reasons, the demand to buy shares in the Dallas-headquartered company was tremendous.
It was not a case of the investment bankers having to sell the stock ; it was more one of allotting a few shares to a number of customers and explaining to others why they had no more to sell.
Investors who wanted 100 shares in many cases ended up with 25, and customers who had put in a bid to buy 400 shares found themselves with 100 and counted themselves lucky to get that many.
In fact, very few customers, anywhere in the nation, were able to get more than 100 shares.
Some Dallas investment firms got only 100 shares, for all of their customers.
A measure of how hot the stock was, can be found in what happened to it on the market as soon as trading began.
The stock was sold in the underwriting at a price of $12.50 a share.
The first over-the-counter trade Wednesday afternoon at Eppler, Guerin & Turner, the managing underwriter, was at $17 a share.
And from that the stock moved right on up until it was trading Thursday morning at around $22 a share.
But the Morton Foods issue was hot long before it was on the market.
Indeed, from the moment the reports of the coming issue first started circulating in Dallas last January, the inquiries and demand for the stock started building up.
Letters by the reams came in from investment firms all over the nation, all of them wanting to get a part of the shares that would be sold ( 185,000 to the public at $12.50, with another 5,000 reserved for Morton Foods employes at $11.50 a share ).
There was even a cable in French from a bank in Switzerland that had somehow learned about the Dallas stock offering.
We subscribe 500 shares of Morton Foods of Texas.
Cable confirmation, it said translated.
But E.*g.*t. could not let the Swiss bank have even 10 shares.
After it allotted shares to 41 underwriters and 52 selling group members from coast to coast there were not many shares for anyone.
But the result of it all was, E.*g.*t. partner Dean Guerin believes, an effective distribution of the stock to owners all over the nation.
I feel confident the stock will qualify for the national list, he said, meaning its market price would be quoted regularly in newspapers all over the country.
He was also pleased with the wide distribution because he thought it proved again his argument that Dallas investment men can do just as good a job as the big New York investment bankers claim only they can do.
But what made the Morton Foods stock issue such a hot one?
The answer is that it was a combination of circumstances.
First, the general stock market has been boiling upward for the last few months, driving stocks of all kinds up.
As a result, it is not easy to find a stock priced as the Morton issue was priced ( at roughly 10 times 1960 earnings, to yield a little over 5 per cent on the 64-cent anticipated dividend ).
Second, the potato chip industry has caught the fancy of investors lately, and until Morton Foods came along there were only two potato chip stocks -- Frito and H. W. Lay -- on the market.
Both of those have had dynamic run-ups in price on the market in recent months, both were selling at higher price-earnings and yield bases than Morton was coming to market at, and everyone who knew anything about it expected the Morton stock to have a fast run-up.
And third, the potato chip industry has taken on the flavor of a growth industry in the public mind of late.
Foods, which long had been considered recession resistant but hardly dynamic stocks, have been acting like growth stocks, going to higher price-earnings ratios.
The potato chip industry these days is growing, not only as a result of population increase and public acceptance of convenience foods, but also because of a combination of circumstances that has led to growth by merger.
The history of the U.*s. potato chip industry is that many of today's successful companies got started during the deep depression days.
Those that remain are those that were headed by strong executives, men with the abilities to last almost 30 years in the competitive survival of the fittest.
But today many of those men are reaching retirement age and suddenly realizing that they face an estate tax problem with their closely held companies and also that they have no second-echelon management in their firms.
So they go looking for mergers with other firms that have publicly quoted stock, and almost daily they pound on the doors of firms like Frito.
All those things combined to make the Morton Foods stock the hot issue that it was and is.
Now, if Morton's newest product, a corn chip known as Chip-o's, turns out to sell as well as its stock did, the stock may turn out to be worth every cent of the prices that the avid buyers bid it up to.
Dallas and North Texas is known world-wide as the manufacturing and distribution center of cotton gin machinery and supplies, valued in the millions of dollars.
More than 10 companies maintain facilities in Dallas and one large manufacturer is located to the north at Sherman.
It is no coincidence that the Texas Cotton Ginner's Association is meeting here this week for the 46th time in their 52-year history.
The exhibition of cotton ginning machinery at the State Fair grounds is valued at more than a million dollars.
It weighs in the tons, so the proximity of factory and exhibition area makes it possible for an outstanding exhibit each year.
A modern cotton gin plant costs in the neighborhood of $250,000, and it's a safe assumption that a large percentage of new gins in the U.*s. and foreign countries contain machinery made in this area.
The Murray Co. of Texas, Inc., originated in Dallas in 1896.
They've occupied a 22-acre site since the early 1900's.
More than 700 employees make gin machinery that's sold anywhere cotton is grown.
Murray makes a complete line of ginning equipment except for driers and cleaners, and this machinery is purchased from a Dallas-based firm.
The Continental Gin Co. began operations in Dallas in 1899.
The present company is a combination of several smaller ones that date back to 1834.
Headquarters is in Birmingham, Ala..
Factories are located here and in Prattville, Ala..
About 40 per cent of the manufacturing is done at the Dallas plant by more than 200 employes.
The company sells a complete line of gin machinery all over the cotton-growing world.
Hardwicke-*etter Co. of Sherman makes a full line of gin machinery and equipment.
The firm recently expanded domestic sales into the Southeastern states as a result of an agreement with Cen-*tennial Gin Co..
They export also.
The company began operation in 1900 with hardware and oil mill supplies.
In 1930, they began making cotton processing equipment.
Presently, Hardwicke-*etter employs 300-450 people, depending on the season of the year.
The Lummus Cotton Gin Co. has had a sales and service office in Dallas since 1912.
Factory operations are in Columbus, Ga..
The district office here employs about 65.
The Moss Gordin Lint Cleaner Co. and Gordin Unit System of Ginning have joint headquarters here.
The cleaner equipment firm began operations in 1953 and the unit system, which turns out a complete ginning system, began operations in 1959.
Gordin manufacturing operations are in Lubbock.
The John E. Mitchell Co. began work in Dallas in 1928.
The firm is prominent in making equipment for cleaning seed cotton, driers, and heaters, and they lay claim to being the first maker ( 1910 ) of boil extraction equipment.
The increase in mechanical harvesting of cotton makes cleaning and drying equipment a must for modern gin operation.
Mitchell employs a total of about 400 people.
They export cotton ginning machinery.
The Hinckley Gin Supply Co. is a maker of overhead equipment.
This includes driers, cleaners, burr extractors, separators and piping that's located above gin stands in a complete gin.
The firm began operations back in 1925 and sells equipment in the central cotton belt, including the Mississippi Delta.
The Cen-*tennial Gin Supply Co. has home offices and factory facilities here.
They make gin saws and deal in parts, supplies and some used gin machinery.
The Stacy Co. makes cleaning and drying equipment for sale largely in Texas.
They've been in Dallas since 1921.
Cotton Belt Gin Service, Inc. of Dallas makes gin saws and started here 14 years ago.
They distribute equipment in 11 states.
The firm also handles gin and oil mill supplies such as belting, bearings, etc..
Cotton processing equipment is a sizable segment of Dallas business economy.
New car sales in Dallas County during March showed slight signs of recovering from the doldrums which have characterized sales this year.
Registrations of new cars in Dallas County cracked the 3,000 mark in March for the first time this year.
Totaling 3,399, sales jumped 14 per cent over February's 2,963.
However, compared with March 1960 new car sales of 4,441, this March was off 23 per cent.
On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, the first quarter of 1961 total of 9,273 cars was 21 per cent behind the previous year's 3-month total of 11,744.
This year-to-year decline for Dallas County closely follows the national trend -- estimated sales of domestic cars in the U.*s. for first three months of 1961 were about 1,212,000 or 80 per cent of the total in the first quarter a year earlier.
With the March pickup, dealers are optimistic that the April-*june quarter will equal or top last year.
The March gain plus this optimism has been encouraging enough to prompt auto makers to boost production schedules for the next quarter.
On the local level, compacts continue to grab a larger share of the market at the expense of lower-priced standard models and foreign cars.
Only three standard models -- Buick, Chrysler, and Mercury -- had slight year-to-year gains in March sales in the county.
The top 3 students from 11 participating Dallas County high schools will be honored by the Dallas Sales Executives Club at a banquet at 6 p.m. Tuesday in the Sam Houston Room of the Sheraton-*dallas Hotel as the club winds up its annual Distributive Education project.
Now in its third year, the program is designed to provide a laboratory for those youngsters seeking careers in marketing and salesmanship.
Business firms provide 20 weeks of practical employment to supplement classroom instruction in these fields.
More than 500 juniors and seniors are taking part in the program and 100 firms offer jobs on an educational rather than a need basis.
Principal address will be delivered by Gerald T. Owens, national sales manager for Isodine Pharmical Corp. of New York.
The 33 honored students are : Mike Trigg, Raymond Arrington, and Ronald Kaminsky of Bryan Adams, Janice Whitney, Fil Terral, and Carl David Page of W. H. Adamson ; Bill Burke, Tommie Freeman, and Lawrence Paschall of N. R. Crozier Tech. Paulah Thompson, Gerald Kestner, and Nancy Stephenson of Hillcrest ; Arnold Hayes, Mary Ann Shay, and Lloyd Satterfield of Thomas Jefferson ; William Cluck, Deloris Carrel Carty, and Edna Earl Eaton of North Dallas ; Patricia Ann Neal, Johnny Carruthers, and David Mc*lauchlin of Rylie of Seagoville ; David Wolverton, Sharon Flanagan, and James Weaver of W. W. Samuels ; William Austin, Gary Hammond, and Ronnie Davis of South Oak Cliff ; Bill Eaton, Carolyn Milton, and Ronnie Bert Stone of Sunset ; and Charles Potter, Ronnie Moore, and Robert Bailey of Woodrow Wilson.
The Kennedy administration's new housing and urban renewal proposals, particularly their effect on the Federal Housing Administration, came under fire in Dallas last week.
The Administration's proposals, complex and sweeping as they are, all deal with fringe areas of the housing market rather than its core, stated Caron S. Stallard, first vice-president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
Santa Barbara -- the present recovery movement will gather steady momentum to lift the economy to a new historic peak by this autumn, Beryl W. Sprinkel, economist of Harris Trust & Savings Bank, Chicago, predicted at the closing session here Tuesday of Investment Bankers Assn., California group, conference.
Another speaker, William H. Draper, Jr., former Under Secretary of the Army and now with the Palo Alto venture capital firm of Draper, Gaither & Anderson, urged the U.*s. to throw down the gauntlet of battle to communism and tell Moscow bluntly we won't be pushed around any more.
He urged support for President Kennedy's requests for both defense and foreign aid appropriations.
Not flash in pan Sprinkel told conferees that the recent improvement in economic activity was not a temporary flash in the pan but the beginning of a substantial cyclical expansion that will carry the economy back to full employment levels and witness a renewal of our traditional growth pattern.
In view of the current expansion, which promises to be substantial he said the odds appear to favor rising interest rates in coming months, but there is reason to believe the change will not be as abrupt as in 1958 nor as severe as in late 1959 and 1960.
Thesis refuted Sprinkel strongly refuted the current neo-stagnationist thesis that we are facing a future of limited and slow growth, declaring that this pessimism is based on very limited and questionable evidence.
Rather than viewing the abortive recovery in 1959-60 as a reason for believing we have lost prospects for growth, he said it should be viewed as a lesson well learned which will increase the probability of substantial improvement in this recovery.
Danger cited he cautioned that the greater danger in this recovery may be excessive stimulation by government which could bring moderate inflation.
The economist does not look for a drastic switch in the budget during this recovery and believes it even more unlikely that the Federal Reserve will aggressively tighten monetary policy in the early phases of the upturn as was the case in 1958.
The unsatisfactory 1958-60 expansion, he said, was not due to inadequate growth forces inherent in our economy but rather to the adverse effect of inappropriate economic policies combined with retrenching decisions resulting from the steel strike.
Sacrifices needed Draper declared, as I see it, this country has never faced such great dangers as threaten us today.
We must justify our heritage.
We must be ready for any needed sacrifice.
He said from his experience of two years with Gen. Clay in West Berlin administration, that Russia respects our show of strength, but that presently we're not acting as we should and must.
He called the Cuban tractor plan an outright blackmail action, and noted that in war you can't buy yourself out and that's what we're trying to do.
While he declined to suggest how, he said that sooner or later we must get rid of Castro, for unless we do we're liable to face similar situations in this hemisphere.
Its the start of a direct threat to our own security and I don't believe we can permit that.
New York ( A*p ) -- stock market Tuesday staged a technical recovery, erasing all of Monday's losses in the Associated Press average and making the largest gain in about two weeks.
Analysts saw the move as a continuation of the recovery drive that got under way late Monday afternoon when the list sank to a hoped-for support level represented by around 675 in the Dow Jones industrial average.
It was a level at which some of the investors standing on the sidelines were thought likely to buy the pivotal issues represented in the averages.
Some good news although it looked like a routine technical snapback to Wall Streeters it was accompanied by some good news.
A substantial rise in new orders and sales of durable goods was reported for last month.
Treasury Secretary Douglas Dillon said the economy is expected to advance by a whopping 8% next year, paving the way for lower taxes.
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 7.19 to 687.87.
Of 1,253 issues traded, 695 advanced and 354 declined.
New highs for the year totaled nine and new lows 14.
Trading was comparatively dull throughout the day.
Volume dipped to 3.28 million shares from 3.98 million Monday.
A $25 billion advertising budget in an $800 billion economy was envisioned for the 1970s here Tuesday by Peter G. Peterson, head of one of the world's greatest camera firms, in a key address before the American Marketing Assn..
However, Peterson, president of Bell & Howell, warned 800 U.*s. marketing leaders attending a national conference at the Ambassador, that the future will belong to the industrialist of creative and unconventional wisdom.
Creations needed as we look to the $800 billion economy that is predicted for 1970 and the increase of about 40% in consumer expenditures that will be required to reach that goal, management can well be restless about how this tremendous volume and number of new products will be created and marketed, Peterson said.
With this kind of new product log-jam, the premium for brilliant product planning will obviously go up geometrically.
The executive paid tribute to research and development and technology for their great contributions in the past, but he also cautioned industry that they tend to be great equalizers because they move at a fairly even pace within an industry and fail to give it the short-term advantage which it often needs.
Nothing to fear Peterson said America has nothing to fear in world competition if it dares to be original in both marketing and product ideas.
He cited, as an example, how the American camera industry has been able to meet successfully the competition of Japan despite lower Japanese labor costs, by improving its production know-how and technology.
He also used as an example the manufacturer who introduced an all-automatic camera in Germany, with the result that it became the best selling camera in the German market.
Election of Howard L. Taylor to membership in Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, effective Tuesday, has been announced by Thomas P. Phelan, president of the exchange.
Taylor, president and voting stockholder of Taylor and Co., Beverly Hills, has been active in the securities business since 1925.
Union Oil Co. of California Tuesday offered $120 million in debentures to the public through a group of underwriters headed by Dillon, Read & Co., to raise money to retire a similar amount held by Gulf Oil Corp..
Gulf's holdings could have been converted into 2,700,877 shares of Union Oil common upon surrender of debentures plus cash, according to Union.
Under the new offering, only $60 million in debentures are convertible into 923,076 common shares.
Due in 1986 the new offering Tuesday consisted of $60 million worth of 4-7/8 debentures, due June 1, 1986, at 100%, and $60 million of 4-1/2% convertible subordinated debentures due June 1, 1991, at 100%.
The convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at $65 a share by June 1, 1966 ; $70 by 1971 ; $75 by 1976 ; $80 by 1981 ; $85 by 1986, and $90 thereafter.
New York ( A*p ) -- American Stock Exchange prices enjoyed a fairly solid rise but here also trading dwindled.
Volume was 1.23 million shares, down from Monday's 1.58 million.
Gains of 2-3/4 were posted for Teleprompter and Republic Foil.
Fairchild Camera and Kawecki Chemical gained 2-1/2 each.
Question -- I bought 50 shares of Diversified Growth Stock Fund on Oct. 23, 1959, and 50 more shares of the same mutual fund on Feb. 8, 1960.
Something has gone wrong some place.
I am getting dividends on only 50 shares.
In other words, I am getting only half the dividends I should.
Answer -- write to the fund's custodian bank -- the First National Bank of Jersey City, N.*j..
That bank handles most of the paper work for Diversified Growth Stock Fund, Fundamental Investors, Diversified Investment Fund and Television-*electronics Fund.
The bank installed a magnetic tape electronic data processing system to handle things.
But it seems that this electronic brain wasn't programmed correctly.
This resulted in a great number of errors.
And letters began to come in to this column from irate shareholders.
I visited the bank in March and wrote a story about the situation.
At that time, the people at the bank said they felt that they had the situation in hand.
They indicated that no new errors were being made and that all old errors would be corrected within 60 days.
That 60-day period is over and letters are still coming in from shareholders of these four funds, complaining about mistakes in their accounts.
Maybe it's taking longer to get things squared away than the bankers expected.
Any shareholder of any of these funds who finds a mistake in his account certainly should get in touch with the bank.

Washington ( A*p ) -- Alfred Hayes, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said Tuesday there is no present need for far-reaching reforms which would basically alter the international financial system.
Hayes said that if a way can be found to deal effectively with short-term capital movements between nations, there is no reason, in my judgment why the international financial system cannot work satisfactorily for at least the foreseeable future.
Washington ( U*p*i ) -- New York Central Railroad president Alfred E. Perlman said Tuesday his line would face the threat of bankruptcy if the Chesapeake & Ohio and Baltimore & Ohio Railroads merge.
Perlman said bankruptcy would not be an immediate effect of the merger, but could possibly be an ultimate effect.
The railroad president made the statement in an interview as the Interstate Commerce Commission opened Round 2 of its hearing into the *j & *j request to control and then merge with the *j & *j.
All these kind of things weaken us, Perlman said.
Bad condition Board Chairman Howard Simpson of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., testified the *j & *j was in its worst financial condition since the depression years and badly needed the economic lift it would get from consolidation with the Chesapeake & Ohio Railroad.
The financial situation of the Baltimore & Ohio, has become precarious -- much worse than at any time since the depression of the 1930s, he told the hearing.
*j & *j president Walter J. Tuohy was summoned back for cross-examination by New York Central attorneys before examiner John Bradford who is hearing the complex case.
The New York Central also has asked the *j to permit it to gain control of the *j & *j.
Central was rebuffed by the other two railroads in previous attempts to make it a three-way merger.
The proposed *j & *j & *j railroad would make it the hemisphere's second largest.
Washington ( A*p ) -- the government's short-term borrowing costs rose with Tuesday's weekly offering of Treasury bills.
On $1.1 billion of 90-day bills, the average yield was 2.325%.
The rate a week ago was 2.295%.
Washington, March 11 ( U*p*i ).
-- consumer uncertain about economic conditions.
This was the chief reason for a so-so sales outlook given by two-thirds of 56 builders polled by the National Housing Center.
Other reasons mentioned by one-third or more of the builders were resistance to high interest rates, cost advantage of buying over renting has narrowed, shelter market nearing saturation and prospects unable to qualify.
Increase expected the poll was taken at the Center's annual builders' intentions conference.
It disclosed that the builders : expect their own production volume, and presumably sales, to jump 30 percent in 1961.
Look for home building nationally to advance less than 10 percent this year from 1960's 1,257, 7000 non-farm housing starts.
The industry has said 1960 was a poor year.
Starts were down 20 percent from 1959.
Why the discrepancy between the builders' forecasts for themselves and for the industry?
Leaders of industry the reason, says the Housing Center, is that the builders invited to the intentions conference are generally among the more successful businessmen, and usually do somewhat better than their fellow builders.
Elburn, Ill. -- farm machinery dealer Bob Houtz tilts back in a battered chair and tells of a sharp pickup in sales : we've sold four corn pickers since Labor Day and have good prospects for 10 more.
We sold only four pickers all last year.
Gus Ehlers, competitor of Mr. Houtz in this farm community, says his business since August 1 is running 50% above a year earlier.
Before then, my sales during much of the year had lagged behind 1960 by 20%, he says.
Though the sales gains these two dealers are experiencing are above average for their business, farm equipment sales are climbing in most rural areas.
Paradoxically, the sales rise is due in large measure to Government efforts to slash farm output.
Although the Administration's program cut crop acreage to the lowest point since 1934, farmers, with the help of extra fertilizer and good weather, are getting such high yields per acre that many are being forced to buy new harvesting machines.
Fields of corn and some other crops in many cases are so dense that older equipment cannot handle them efficiently.
The higher price supports provided by the new legislation, together with rising prices for farm products, are pushing up farm income, making it possible for farmers to afford the new machinery.
Seven of the eight companies that turn out full lines of farm machinery say sales by their dealers since the start of August have shown gains averaging nearly 10% above last year.
In August our dealers sold 13% more farm machinery than a year earlier and in September retail sales were 14% higher than last year, says Mark V. Keeler, farm equipment vice president of International Harvester Co..
For the year to date, sales of the company's farm equipment dealers still lag about 5% behind 1960.
Two of three report gains among individual dealers questioned in nearly a score of states, two out of three report their sales since August 1 show sizable gains from a year earlier, with the increases ranging from 5% to 50%.
Not all sections are showing an upswing, however ; the drought-seared North Central states are the most notable exceptions to the uptrend.
The significance of the pickup in farm machinery sales extends beyond the farm equipment industry.
The demand for farm machinery is regarded as a yardstick of rural buying generally.
Farmers spend more of their income on tractors and implements than on any other group of products.
More than 20 million people live on farms and they own a fourth of the nation's trucks, buy more gasoline than any other industry and provide a major market for home appliances, chemicals and other products.
Farmers are so eager for new machinery that they're haggling less over prices than they did a year ago, dealers report.
Farmers aren't as price conscious as last year so we can get more money on a sale, says Jack Martin, who sells J. I. Case tractors and implements in Sioux City, Iowa.
This morning, we allowed a farmer $600 on the old picker he traded in on a new $2,700 model.
Last year, we probably would have given him $700 for a comparable machine.
Mr. Martin sold 21 tractors in August ; in August of 1960, he sold seven.
Dealers' stocks down with dealer stocks of new equipment averaging about 25% below a year ago, the affects of the rural recovery are being felt almost immediately by the country's farm equipment manufacturers.
For example, farm equipment shipments of International Harvester in August climbed about 5% above a year earlier, Mr. Keeler reports.
Tractor production at Massey-*ferguson, Ltd., of Toronto in July and August rose to 2,418 units from 869 in the like period a year earlier, says John Staiger, vice president.
With the lower dealer inventories and the stepped-up demand some manufacturers believe there could be shortages of some implements.
Merritt D. Hill, Ford Motor Co. vice president, says his company is starting to get calls daily from dealers demanding immediate delivery or wanting earlier shipping dates on orders for corn pickers.
Except for a few months in late 1960 and early 1961, retail farm equipment sales have trailed year-earlier levels since the latter part of 1959.
The rise in sales last winter was checked when the Government's new feed grain program was adopted ; the program resulted in a cutback of around 20% in planted acreage and, as a result, reduced the immediate need for machines.
Nearly all of the farm equipment manufacturers and dealers say the upturn in sales has resulted chiefly from the recent improvement in crop prospects.
Total farm output for this year is officially forecast at 129% of the 1947-49 average, three points higher than the July 1 estimate and exactly equal to the final figure for 1960.
The Government also is aiding farmers' income prospects.
Agriculture Department economists estimate the Government this year will hand farmers $1.4 billion in special subsidies and incentive payments, well above the record $1.1 billion of 1958 and about double the $639 million of 1960.
Price support loans may total another $1 billion this year.
With cash receipts from marketings expected to be slightly above 1960, farmers' gross income is estimated at $39.5 billion, $1.5 billion above 1960's record high.
Net income may reach $12.7 billion, up $1 billion from 1960 and the highest since 1953.
The Government reported last week that the index of prices received by farmers rose in the month ended at mid-*september for the third consecutive month, reaching 242% of the 1910-14 average compared with 237% at mid-*july.
Kennedy opposes any widespread relief from a High Court depletion ruling.
The Supreme Court decision in mid-1960 was in the case of a company making sewer pipe from clay which it mined.
The company, in figuring its taxable earnings, deducted a percentage of the revenue it received for its finished products.
Such depletion allowances, in the form of percentages of sales are authorized by tax law for specified raw materials producers using up their assets.
The High Court held that the company must apply its percentage allowance to the value of the raw materials removed from the ground, not to the revenue from finished products.
A measure passed by Congress just before adjourning softened the ruling's impact, on prior-year returns still under review, for clay-mining companies that make brick and tile products.
The measure allows such companies in those years to apply their mineral depletion allowances to 50% of the value of the finished products rather than the lower value of raw clay alone.
President Kennedy, in signing the relief measure into law, stressed he regarded it as an exception.
My approval of this bill should not be viewed as establishing a precedent for the enactment of similar legislation for other mineral industries, the President said.
Charitable deductions come in for closer scrutiny by the I.*r.*s..
The Service announced that taxpayers making such claims may be called on to furnish a statement from the recipient organization showing the date, purpose, amount and other particulars of the contribution.
Requests for substantiation, the Service indicated, can be especially expected in cases where it suspects the donor received some material benefit in return, such as tickets to a show.
In such an instance, revenuers stressed, the deduction must be reduced by the value of the benefit received.
A rule on the Federal deductibility of state taxes is contested.
A realty corporation in Louisiana owed no tax, under Federal law, on its gain from the sale of property disposed of in line with a plan of liquidation.
Louisiana, however, collected an income tax on the profits from the sale.
The corporation, in filing its final Federal income return, claimed the state tax payment as a deductible expense, as permitted under U.*s. tax law.
The Revenue Service disallowed the claim, invoking a law provision that generally bars deductions for expenses incurred in connection with what it said was tax-exempt income.
The Tax Court rejected this view.
It said the tax-freedom of the gain in this case stemmed not from the exempt status of the income but from a special rule on corporate liquidations.
The Tax Court decision and a similar earlier finding by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals challenges a year-old I.*r.*s. ruling on the subject.
The Service has not said what its next step will be.
Peace Corps volunteers are assured a tax benefit under the law creating the agency.
It provides that the $1,800 termination payment each cadet is to get, after serving a two-year hitch without pay, will be spread over both years, not taxed in its entirety at a possibly higher rate in the year received.
The owner of a public relations firm owed no income tax on payments he received from a client company and kicked back to the company's advertising manager, the Tax Court ruled.
The taxpayer testified that in order to retain the account he had to pad his invoices and pay the excess to the manager.
The Court upheld the taxpayer's contention that these kickbacks were not his income though they passed through his hands.
The Court limited its decision to the tax issue involved, commenting : it is not our province to pass judgment on the morality of the transaction.
A portable kerosene range designed for use aboard boats is sold with a special railing to keep it from moving with the motion of the vessel.
The Revenue Service said the addition of the attachment does not keep the range from coming under the Federal manufacturers' excise tax on household-type appliances.
Hiring the wife for one's company may win her tax-aided retirement income.
A spouse employed by a corporation her husband controls, for example, may be entitled to distributions under the company's pension plan as well as to her own Social Security coverage.
She would be taxed on the pensions when received, of course, but the company's contributions would be tax-free.
A frequent pitfall in this sort of arrangement, experts warn, is a tendency to pay the wife more than her job is worth and to set aside an excessive amount for her as retirement income.
In that event, they note, the Revenue Service might declare the pension plan is discriminatory and deny it tax privileges under the law.
Possible upshots : the company could be denied a deduction for its pension payments, or those payments for the wife and other employes could be ruled taxable to them in the year made.
State briefs : voters in four counties containing and bordering Denver authorized the imposition of an additional 2% sales tax within that area.
Colorado has a 2% sales tax.
Denver itself collects a 1% sales tax which is to be absorbed in the higher area tax.
The Washington state supreme court ruled that the state's occupation tax applied to sales, made at cost to an oil company, by a wholly-owned subsidiary set up to purchase certain supplies without divulging the identity of the parent.
The state's occupation tax is computed on gross sales.
The court held that the tax applied to non-profit sales because the corporations realized economic benefits by doing business as two separate entities.
Washington -- consumer spending edged down in April after rising for two consecutive months, the Government reported.
The Commerce Department said seasonally adjusted sales of retail stores dropped to slightly under $18 billion in April, down 1% from the March level of more than $18.2 billion.
April sales also were 5% below those of April last year, when volume reached a record for any month, $18.9 billion ( see chart on Page One ).
The seasonal adjustment takes into account such factors as Easter was on April 2 this year, two weeks earlier than in 1960, and pre-*easter buying was pushed into March.
Commerce Department officials were inclined to explain the April sales decline as a reaction from a surge of consumer buying in March.
Adjusted sales that month were up a relatively steep 2.5% from those of the month before, which in turn were slightly higher than the January low of $17.8 billion.
Greer Garson, world-famous star of stage, screen and television, will be honored for the high standard in tasteful sophisticated fashion with which she has created a high standard in her profession.
As a Neiman-*marcus award winner the titian-haired Miss Garson is a personification of the individual look so important to fashion this season.
She will receive the 1961 Oscar at the 24th annual Neiman-*marcus Exposition, Tuesday and Wednesday in the Grand Ballroom of the Sheraton-*dallas Hotel.
The only woman recipient, Miss Garson will receive the award with Ferdinando Sarmi, creator of chic, beautiful women's fashions ; Harry Rolnick, president of the Byer-*rolnick Hat Corporation and designer of men's hats ; Sydney Wragge, creator of sophisticated casuals for women and Roger Vivier, designer of Christian Dior shoes Paris, France, whose squared toes and lowered heels have revolutionized the shoe industry.
The silver and ebony plaques will be presented at noon luncheons by Stanley Marcus, president of Neiman-*marcus, Beneficiary of the proceeds from the two showings will be the Dallas Society for Crippled Children Cerebral Palsy Treatment Center.
The attractive Greer Garson, who loves beautiful clothes and selects them as carefully as she does her professional roles, prefers timeless classical designs.
Occasionally she deserts the simple and elegant for a fun piece simply because it's unlike me.
In private life, Miss Garson is Mrs. E. E. Fogelson and on the go most of the time commuting from Dallas, where they maintain an apartment, to their California home in Los Angeles' suburban Bel-*air to their ranch in Pecos, New Mexico.
Therefore, her wardrobe is largely mobile, to be packed at a moment's notice and to shake out without a wrinkle.
Her creations in fashion are from many designers because she doesn't want a complete wardrobe from any one designer any more than she wants all of her pictures by one painter.
A favorite is Norman Norell, however.
She likes his classic chemise.
Her favorite cocktail dress is a Norell, a black and white organdy and silk jersey.
Irene suits rate high because they are designed for her long-bodied silhouette.
She also likes the femininity and charm of designs by Ceil Chapman and Helen Rose.
Balenciaga is her favorite European designer.
I bought my first dress from him when I was still a struggling young actress, she reminisces.
I like his clothes for their drama and simplicity and appreciate the great impact he has on fashion.
Black and white is her favorite color combination along with lively glowing pinks, reds, blues and greens.
Of Scotch-*irish-*scandinavian descent, Greer Garson was born in County Down, Ireland.
Her mother was a Greer and her father's family came from the Orkney Isles.
Reared in England, she studied to be a teacher, earned several scholarships and was graduated with honors from the University of London.
She took postgraduate work at the University of Grenoble in France and then returned to London to work on market research with an advertising firm.
Her acting began with the Birmingham Repertory Company and she soon became the toast of the West End.
Among stage performances was a starring role in Golden Arrow directed by Noel Coward.
It was during Old Music at the St. James Theater that Hollywood's Louis B. Mayer spotted her.
After signing a motion-picture contract, she came to America and had goodbye, Mr. Chips as her first assignment after a year's wait.
Other triumphs include Random Harvest, Madame Curie, Pride and Prejudice, The Forsythe Saga and Mrs. Miniver ( which won her the Academy Award in 1943 ).
Honors that have come to Greer Garson are countless.
Just this April she was nominated for the seventh time for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello.
She gave a fine portrayal of Auntie Mame on Broadway in 1958 and has appeared in live television from Captain Brassbound's Conversion to Camille.
She is in Madame Tussard's Waxworks in London, a princess of the Kiowa tribe and an honorary colonel in many states.
She is adept at skeet shooting, trout fishing, Afro-*cuban and Oriental dancing and Southwestern archaeology.
She now serves on the board of directors of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Theater Center and on the board of trustees of the Dallas Museum of Fine Arts.
She is state chairman for the New Mexico Tuberculosis and Cancer Associations.
Both Miss Garson and her oilman-rancher husband are active supporters of Boys Clubs of America and patrons of the vivid art and opera colony that flourishes in New Mexico.
Back in college, today's handsome Gander was the only male member of a Texas Tech class on food.
The pretty coeds must have ogled him all day long -- but he dutifully kept his eye on the gravy.
Last October he gave a public speech in Washington, D.*c. entitled Are Women Here To Stay?
So you can see that Gerald G. Ramsey, director of *j food services, is not the ordinary type of craven, women-trodden chef.
He is apt to rear back and claim his rights.
Ramsey, as *j food wrangler, buys enough groceries to serve 32,000 meals a week.
Tell that to the little wife when she moans at the woman's burden ] he also dishes up 3,000 snacks.
And he operates three cafeterias in the Student Center, along with Mc*elvaney Dining Hall and the athlete's tables.
Ramsey, 6-3, 195 and ruggedly slim, says, I can't remember when I didn't pester my mother to teach me to cook.
He was in charge of the Hockaday School meals from 1946 to 1950, before he moved to *j.
And you'll notice that in both places, there are acres of charming young ladies who with little effort spice up any chow line.
What does he feed his *j football mastodons at the training table?
Mostly meat and potatoes -- they have to have that go-go-go without getting too fat, says Ramsey.
So he hides the mayonnaise.
And to keep athletes' stomachs from getting jumpy under physical duress, he bans all highly flavored condiments.
What do the pretty *j girls like on their plates?
Pretty much hamburger, hotdogs, steak and, at night, maybe pizza, says the handsome food expert.
Unfortunately, there is still little demand for broccoli and cauliflower.
Ramsey has stoked up Harry Truman, Henry Cabot Lodge, the King of Morocco, Clement Atlee and other shiny characters.
Once four Tibetan monks, in their saffron robes, filed through the cafeteria line.
They aren't supposed to look at women, you know, Ramsey recalled.
What with all those pretty girls around, they had a hard time.
Chicken Cadillac use one 6-ounce chicken breast for each guest.
Salt and pepper each breast.
Dip in melted butter and roll in flour.
Place side by side in a 2-inch deep baking pan.
Bake slowly about one hour at 250-275 F. until lightly brown.
Add enough warmed cream, seasoned to taste with onion juice, to about half cover the chicken breasts.
Bake slowly at least one-half hour longer.
While this is baking, saute mushrooms, fresh or canned, in butter.
Sprinkle over top of chicken breasts.
Serve each breast on a thin slice of slow-baked ham and sprinkle with Thompson seedless grapes.
( leave off the ham and you call it Chicken Pontiac, says Ramsey.
) contemporary furniture that is neither Danish nor straight-line modern but has sculptured pattern, many design facets, warmth, dignity and an effect of utter comfort and livability.
That is the goal of two new collections being introduced in Dallas this month.
Though there has been some avant garde indication that contemporary furniture might go back to the boxy look of the '20's and '40's, two manufacturers chose to take the approach of the sophisticated, but warm look in contemporary.
These two, Heritage and Drexel, chose too not to produce the exactly matching design for every piece, but a collection of correlated designs, each of which could stand alone.
The Heritage collection, to be shown by Sanger-*harris and Anderson's Studio, has perhaps more different types of woods and decorations than any one manufacturer ever assembled together at one time.
Called Perennian, to indicate its lasting, good today and tomorrow quality, the collection truly avoids the monotony of identical pieces.
Walnut, wormy chestnut, pecan, three varieties of burl, hand-woven Philippine cane, ceramic tiles, marble are used to emphasize the feeling of texture and of permanence, the furniture to fit into rooms with tiled floors, brick or paneled walls, windows that bring in the outdoors.
It is a collection with a custom-design look, offering simplicity with warmth, variety and vitality.
The Drexel collection, called Composite, to be shown by Titche's offers a realistic approach to decorating, a mature modern that is a variation of many designs.
Rounded posts give a soft, sculptured look, paneled doors have decorative burl panels or cane insets plus softening arches, table tops are inlaid in Macassar ebony or acacia.
A high-legged buffet provides easy-to-reach serving, a cocktail table has small snack tables tucked under each end, recessed arched panels decorate a 60-inch long chest.
An interesting approach to the bedroom is presented, with a young, basic, functional group of chests, dressers and corner units and a canted headboard.
The other bedroom has heavier styling, door-fronted dressers with acacia panels, a poster bed or a bed with arched acacia panels and matching mirror.
Colorful, bright Eastman Chromspun fabrics, with the magenta, pink and white tones predominating as well as golden shades are used with Composite.
The fabrics have Scotchgard finish to resist soil and wrinkles.
Design elements closely rooted to traditional forms but wearing a definite contemporary label keynote Drexel's fall 1961 group, Composite.
The spider-leg pedestal table has a base finished in an ebony, to set off the lustrous brown of the walnut top.
See-through design of the chairs combines both the nostalgic ladder back and an Oriental shoji flavor.
To bring warmth to the dining area, golden orange tones are used in the fabrics.
Dignity and comfort, in a contemporary manner, reflecting the best aspects of today's design, with substance and maturity, keynote the Perennian collection from Heritage.
Center panel, hand-screened wood, actually is a back of one of the tall bookcases.
Mellow bronzy-green-gold fabrics and the gleam of copper and hand-crafted ceramic accessories reiterate the mood as does the Alexander Smith carpet in all wool loop pile.
The Vagabonds are on the road again.
Members are on their way to Saledo, not by stage coach, but in air-conditioned cars.
This coming weekend they have reserved the entire Stagecoach Inn and adjoining country club, Saledo, for festivities.
Invitations have been extended to some Austin dignitaries including Gov. and Mrs. Price Daniel.
Stagecoach Days is the theme for the weekend on the Old Chisholm Trail.
The get-together Friday night will be a banquet at the country club patio and pool, and an orchestra will play for dancing.
Guests will wear costumes typical of the Chisholm Trail Days.
Ginghams and calico will be popular dress for the women.
The men will be in western attire, including Stetsons and colored vests.
Decorating the ballroom will be the yellow rose of Texas, in tall bushes ; bluebonnets and stagecoach silhouettes.
There will be a large drawing of a sunbonnet girl with eyes that flash at the guests.
Mr. and Mrs. Phil G. Abell are chairmen for the Saledo trip.
Committee members aiding them in planning the entertainment are *j and *j Roy Mc*kee, George Mc*elyee, Jack Fanning, W. H. Roquemore and Joe Darrow.
The travel club is comprised of 75 fun-loving couples who have as their motto Go Somewhere, Anywhere, Everywhere.
Their activities will be climaxed in the spring of 1962 when they go to Europe.
In the past, the men and women have chartered planes to Las Vegas and Jamaica, buses to Mineral Wells and Kerrville and private railway coaches to Shreveport and Galveston.
Four parties are given a year.
Two of these are in or near Dallas and the others away from the vicinity.
Serving on the club's board are *j R. P. Anderson, president ; A. F. Schmalzried, secretary ; W. H. Roquemore, treasurer, and the following chairmen : *j Mc*kee, publicity ; Lawrence B. Jones, yearbook, and Sam Laughlin, scrapbook.
A cookie with caramel filling and chocolate frosting won $25,000 for a Minneapolis housewife in the 13th annual Pillsbury Bake-*off Tuesday.
Mrs. Alice H. Reese, wife of an engineer and mother of a 23-year-old son, was awarded the top prize at a luncheon in the Beverly Hilton Hotel.
Mrs. Reese entered 10 past bake-offs before she got into the finals.
Second grand prize of $5,000 went to Mrs. Clara L. Oliver for her Hawaiian coffee ring, a rich yeast bread with coconut filling and vanilla glaze.
Mother of five Mrs. Oliver is mother of five children and wife of a machinist.
She lives in Wellsville, Mo..
Mrs. Reese baked her cookies for only the third time in the Bake-off finals.
And the third time was the charm.
She dreamed up the cookie recipe, tried it, liked it and entered it in the contest.
The second baking was for photographing when told she was a finalist.
The third time was on the floor of the Beverly Hilton ballroom and for the critical eyes and tongues of judges.
Mr. and Mrs. Joseph R. Bolker will give a dinner on Friday at their home in Beverly Hills to honor Mrs. Norman Chandler, chairman of the Music Center Building Fund Committee, and Mr. Chandler.
Mr. Bolker heads a group within the building and development industry to raise funds in support of this cultural center for the performing arts.
A feature of the party will be a presentation by Welton Becket, center architect, of color slides and renderings of the three-building complex.
Foliage will glow at formal fall party fall foliage and flowers will decorate Los Angeles Country Club for the annual formal party Saturday evening.
More than 200 are expected at the autumn event which is matched in the spring.
Among those with reservations are Messrs. and Mmes. William A. Thompson, Van Cott Niven, A. B. Cox, David Bricker, Samuel Perry and Robert D. Stetson.
Others are Drs. and Mmes. Alfred Robbins, and J. Lafe Ludwig and Gen. and Mrs. Leroy Watson.
Guests from across U.*s. honor Dr. Swim when Dr. W. A. Swim celebrated his 75th birthday at the Wilshire Country Club, guests came by chartered plane from all over the country.
A flight originating in Florida picked up guests on the East Coast and Midwest and a plane left from Seattle taking on passengers at West Coast points.
Cocktails and a buffet supper were served to more than 100 persons who had known Dr. Swim when he practiced in Los Angeles.
He started practice in 1917, and served on the State Board of Medical Examiners.
Giving up the violin opened a whole new career for Ilona Schmidl-*seeberg, a tiny Hungarian who Fritz Kreisler had predicted would have a promising career on the concert stage.
A heart attack when she was barely 20 put an end to the 10-hour daily practicing.
She put the violin away and took out some linen, needles and yarn to while away the long, idle days in Budapest.
Now her modern tapestries have been exhibited on two continents and, at 26, she feels she is on the threshold of a whole new life in Los Angeles.
Her days as an art student at the University of Budapest came to a sudden end during the Hungarian uprisings in 1957 and she and her husband Stephen fled to Vienna.
There they continued their studies at the university, she in art, he in architecture.
And there she had her first showing of tapestry work.
There's a lot of talk about the problem of education in America today.
What most people don't seem to realize, if they aren't tied up with the thing as I am, is that 90% of the problem is transportation.
I never dreamed of the logistical difficulties involved until, at long last, both of my boys got squeezed into high school.
It seems like only last year that we watched them set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in their yellow raincoats to finger-paint at the grammar school.
Getting to and from school was no problem.
They either walked or were driven.
Now they go to a high school that is two miles away.
One might think the problem would be similar.
They could walk, ride on a bus or be driven.
It's much more complex than that.
Generally, they go to school with a girl named Gloriana, who lives down the block, and has a car.
This is a way of getting to school, but, I understand, it entails a certain loss of social status.
A young man doesn't like to be driven up in front of a school in a car driven by a girl who isn't even in a higher class than he is, and is also a girl.
Why don't you walk to school then?
I suggested.
My father walked, through two miles of snow, in Illinois.
Did you?
I was asked.
No, I said, I didn't happen to grow up in Illinois.
I explained, however, that I had my share of hardship in making my daily pilgrimage to the feet of wisdom.
I had to ride a streetcar two miles.
Sometimes the streetcar was late.
Sometimes there weren't even any seats.
I had to stand up, with the ladies.
Sometimes I got on the wrong car and didn't get to school at all, but wound up at the ocean, or some other dismal place, and had to spend the day there.
I've tried to compromise by letting them take the little car now and then.
When they do that my wife has to drive me to work in the big car.
She has to have at least one car herself.
I feel a certain loss of status when I am driven up in front of work in a car driven by my wife, who is only a woman.
Even that isn't satisfactory.
If they have to take any car, they'd rather take the big one.
They say that when they take a car, Gloriana doesn't take her car, but rides with them.
But when Gloriana rides with them they also have to take the two girls who usually ride with her, so the little car isn't big enough.
The logic of that is impeccable, of course, except that I feel like a fool being driven up to work in a little car, by my wife, when everybody knows I have a big car and am capable of driving myself.
The solution, naturally, is the bus.
However, it's a half-mile walk down a steep hill from our house to the bus, and it's too hard on my legs.
My wife could drive us down the hill and we could all walk from there.
But that's hardly realistic.
Nobody walks anymore but crackpots and Harry Truman, and he's already got an education.
Advance publicity on the Los Angeles Blue Book does not mention names dropped as did the notices for the New York Social Register which made news last week.
Published annually by William Hord Richardson, the 1962 edition, subtitled Society Register of Southern California, is scheduled to arrive with Monday morning's postman.
Publisher Richardson has updated the Blue Book but it still remains the compact reference book used by so many for those ever-changing telephone numbers, addresses, other residences, club affiliations and marriages.
Stars for marriage stars throughout the volume denote dates of marriages during the past year.
Last two to be added before the book went to press were the marriages of Meredith Jane Cooper, daughter of the Grant B. Coopers, to Robert Knox Worrell, and of Mary Alice Ghormley to Willard Pen Tudor.
Others are Carla Ruth Craig to Dan Mc*farland Chandler Jr. ; Joanne Curry, daughter of the Ellsworth Currys, to James Hartley Gregg, and Valerie Smith to James Mc*alister Duque.
Also noted are the marriages of Elizabeth Browning, daughter of the George L. Brownings, to Austin C. Smith Jr. ; Cynthia Flower, daughter of the Ludlow Flowers Jr., to Todd Huntington, son of the David Huntingtons.
Pasadena listings listed as newly wed in the Pasadena section of the new book are Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Moody Haskins 3.
She is the former Judy Chapman, daughter of John S. Chapman of this city.
The young couple live in Pasadena.
Another marriage of note is that of Jane Mc*alester and William Louis Pfau.
Changes in address are noted.
For instance, the Edwin Pauleys Jr., formerly of Chantilly Rd., are now at home on North Arden Dr. in Beverly Hills.
Mr. and Mrs. Robert Moulton now live on Wilshire and the Franklin Moultons on S. Windsor Blvd..
The Richard Beesemyers, formerly of Connecticut, have returned to Southern California and are now residing on South Arden Blvd..
But the Raoul Esnards have exchanged their residence in Southern California for Mexico City.
More new addresses Judge and Mrs. Julian Hazard are now at Laguna Beach, while the Frank Wangemans have moved from Beverly Hills to New York, where he is general manager of the Waldorf-*astoria Hotel.
And Lawrence Chase, son of the Ransom Chases, is listed at his new address in Oxford, Eng..
Others listed at new addresses are the Richard T. Olerichs, the Joseph Aderholds Jr., the Henri De La Chapelles, the John Berteros and Dr. and Mrs. Egerton Crispin, the John Armisteads, the Allen Chases, the Howard Lockies, the Thomas Lockies, and Anthony Longinotti.
Newcomers of social note from other parts of the country are the Ray Carbones, formerly of Panama ; the Geddes Mac*gregors, formerly of Scotland, and Mr. and Mrs. Werner H. Althaus, formerly of Switzerland.
Here's an idea for a child's room that is easy to execute and is completely charming, using puppets for lamp bases.
Most children love the animated puppet faces and their flexible bodies, and they prefer to see them as though the puppets were in action, rather than put away in boxes.
Displayed as lamps, the puppets delight the children and are decorative accent.
To create such a lamp, order a wired pedestal from any lamp shop.
Measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket, allowing three to four inches above the puppet's head.
Make sure that the metal tube through which the wire passes is in the shape of an inverted *j, the foot of the *j about three inches long, so that the puppet can hang directly under the light.
Pulling strings using the strings that manipulate the puppet, suspend him from the light fixture by tying the strings to the lamp base.
In this way, you can arrange his legs and arms in any desired position, with feet, or one foot, barely resting on the pedestal.
If the puppets are of uniform size, you can change them in accord with your child's whims.
Although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppets could be changed without disharmony, it is far more fun to create shades in the gay spirit of a child's playtime.
Those illustrated are reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round.
The scalloped edge is particularly appealing.
Today's trend toward furniture designs from America's past is teaching home-owners and decorators a renewed respect for the shrewd cabinetmakers of our Colonial era.
A generation ago there were plenty of people who appreciated antiques and fine reproductions.
In the background lurked the feeling, however, that these pieces, beautiful as they were, lacked the utilitarian touch.
So junior's bedroom was usually tricked out with heavy, nondescript pieces that supposedly could take the hard knocks, while the fine secretary was relegated to the parlor where it was for show only.
This isn't true of the many homemakers of the 1960's, according to decorator consultant, Leland Alden.
Housewives are finding literally hundreds of ways of getting the maximum use out of traditional designs, says Mr. Alden and they are doing it largely because Colonial craftsmen had an innate sense of the practical.
Solid investment there are a number of reasons why the Eighteenth Century designer had to develop down to earth designs -- or go out of business.
Hotel Escape's Bonanza room has a real bonanza in its new attraction, the versatile Kings 4 Plus Two.
This is the strongest act to hit the area in a long while -- a well integrated, fast moving outfit specializing in skits, vocals, comedy and instrumentals all of it distinctly displaying the pro touch.
Show spotlights the Kings -- George Worth, Bill Kay, Frank Ciciulla and Gene Wilson, flanked by Dave Grossman and Ron Stevens.
The Plus Two remain at a fixed position with drums and guitar but the quartet covers the stage with a batch of instruments ranging from tuba to tambourine, and the beat is solid.
In the comedy division, the Kings simply augment talent and imagination with a few props.
Net result is some crazy-wonderful nonsense, part of which can be classed as pure slapstick.
Kings 4 have rated as a popular act in Vegas and Western nightclubs.

We like Fike Al Fike, an ex-schoolteacher from Colorado, is currently pursuing the three *j -- rhythm, reminiscence and repartee -- in a return class session at the Trade Winds Hotel.
Al has added some sidemen to the act which makes for a smoother operation but it's substantially the same format heard last spring.
Newcomers are Ernie Kemm on piano, Wes Robbins, bass and trumpet, and Jack Kelly on drums.
It's a solid show but, except for some interim keyboarding by Ernie, it's Al's all the way.
Maestro's biggest stock in trade is his personality, and ability to establish a warm rapport with his audience.
He skips around from jazz, to blues to boogie -- accompanying himself on piano and frequently pulling the customers in on the act.
This is a bouncy show which may get a little too frantic at times, but is nevertheless worth your appraisal.

Is there anything a frustrated individual can do about Communism's growing threat on our doorstep and around the world?
More than 300 teenagers last Sunday proved there is and as many more are expected to prove it again for Jim Kern and his wife Lynn from 4 to 8 p.m. Sunday at First Presbyterian Church.
At that time the second half of the Christian Youth Crusade against Communism will be staged.
A young real estate salesman, Kern first got seriously interested in the problems posed by Communism when in the Navy Air Force.
He was particularly struck by a course on Communist brainwashing.
Kern began reading a lot about the history and philosophy of Communism, but never felt there was anything he, as an individual, could do about it.
When he attended the Christian Anti-*communist Crusade school here about six months ago, Jim became convinced that an individual can do something constructive in the ideological battle and set out to do it.
The best approach, he figured, was to try to influence young people like the high schoolers he and his wife serve as advisors at First Presbyterian Church.
And he wanted to be careful that the kids not only learn about Communist but also about what he feels is the only antidote -- a Biblically strong Christianity.
So the Christian Youth Crusade against Communisn developed and more than 300 top teenagers and 65 adult advisers from Presbyterian churches of the area sat enthralled at the four-hour program.
This Sunday those attending the second session will hear a lecture by Kern on the world situation ; a review of the philosophy of Communist leaders by Ted Slack, another real estate agent who became interested as a philosophy major at the University of Miami ; and talks on how their Christian faith can guide them in learning about and fighting Communism during high school and college days, by Ted Place, director of Greater Miami Youth for Christ, and Jon Braun, director of Campus Crusade for Christ.
The second half of the film Communism on the Map and the movie Operation Abolition also will be shown.
Response to the program has been so encouraging, Kern said, that a city-wide youth school at Dade County Auditorium may be set up soon.
And to encourage other churches to try their own programs, Kern said this Sunday's sessions -- including the free dinner -- will be open to anyone who makes reservations.
The need for and the way to achieve a Christian home will be stressed in special services marking National Christian Family Week in Miami area churches next week.
Of particular meaning to the Charles Mac*whorter family, 3181 *j 24th Ter., will be the Family Dedication Service planned for 10:50 a.m. Sunday at First Christian Church.
It will be the second time the assistant manager of a Coral Gables restaurant and his wife have taken part in the twice-a-year ceremonies for families with new babies.
The first one, two years ago, changed the routine of their home life.
When you stand up in public and take vows to strive to set an example before your children and to teach them the fundamentals of the Christian faith, you strive a little harder to uphold those vows, explains the slender vice president of the young couples Sunday school class.
Until that first dedication service, he and Lois felt their children were too young to take part in any religious life at home.
They have five daughters -- Coral Lee, 5, Glenda Rae, 4, Pamela, 3, Karen, 2, and Shari, five months.
But after that service, they decided to try to let the girls say grace at the table, have bedtime prayers, and Bible stories.
To their surprise, the children all were eager and quite able to take part.
Even the two-year-old feels miffed if the family has a prayer-time without her.
Dade's chief probation officer, Jack Blanton, will lead a discussion on The Changes in the American Family at 7:30 p.m. Sunday at Christ Lutheran Church.

New officers of the church will be ordained and installed at the 7:30 p.m. service.
A father and son dinner sponsored by the Men's Club will be held at 6:15 p.m. Monday and the annual church picnic at 4 p.m. next Saturday.
The week will end with the Rev. Mr. Henderson preaching on The Marriage Altar at 7:30 p.m. Sunday, May 14.

Enrique Jorda, conductor and musical director of the San Francisco Symphony, will fulfill two more guest conducting engagements in Europe before returning home to open the symphony's Golden Anniversary season, it was announced.
The guest assignments are scheduled for November 14 and 18, with the Orchestra Sinfonica Siciliana in Palermo and the Orchestra of Radio Cologne.
The season in San Francisco will open with a special Gala Concert on November 22.
During his five-month visit abroad, Jorda recently conducted the Orchestre Philharmonique De Bordeau in France, and the Santa Cecilia Orchestra in Rome.
In announcing Jorda's return, the orchestra also announced that the sale of single tickets for the 50th anniversary season will start at the Sherman Clay box office on Wednesday.
Guest performers and conductors during the coming season will include many renowned artists who began their careers playing with the orchestra, including violinists Yehudi Menuhin, Isaac Stern, Ruggiero Ricci and David Abel ; pianists Leon Fleisher, Ruth Slenczynka and Stephen Bishop and conductor Earl Bernard Murray.
The Leningrad Kirov Ballet, which opened a series of performances Friday night at the Opera House, is, I think, the finest classical ballet company I have ever seen, and the production of the Petipa-*tschaikowsky Sleeping Beauty with which it began the series is incomparably the finest I have ever had the pleasure of witnessing.
This work is no favorite of mine.
I am prepared to demonstrate at anytime that it represents the spirit of Imperial Russia in its most vulgar, infantile, and reactionary aspect ; that its persistent use by ballet companies of the Soviet regime indicates that that old spirit is just as stultifying alive today as it ever was ; that its presentation in this country is part of a capitalist plot to boobify the American people ; that its choreography is undistinguished and its score a shapeless assemblage of self-plagiarisms.
All of this is true and all of it is totally meaningless in the face of the Kirov's utterly captivating presentation.
Precise the reasons for this enchantment are numerous, but most of them end in ova, eva, or aya.
In other words, no merely male creature can resist that corps de ballet.
It seems to have been chosen exclusively from the winners of beauty contests -- Miss Omsk, Miss Pinsk, Miss Stalingr oops, skip it.
These qualities alone, however, would not account for their success, and it took me a while to discover the crowning virtue that completes this company's collective personality.
It is a kind of friendliness and frankness of address toward the audience which we have been led to believe was peculiar to the American ballet.
Oh-the-pain-of-it, that convention of Russian ballet whereby the girls convey the idea that they are all the daughters of impoverished Grand Dukes driven to the stage out of filial piety, is totally absent from the Kirov.
This is all the more remarkable because the Kirov is to ballet what Senator Goldwater is to American politics.
But, obviously, at least some things have changed for the better in Russia so far as the ballet is concerned.
Irina Kolpakova, the Princess Aurora of Friday's performance, would be a change for the better anywhere, at any time, no matter who had had the role before.
She is the most beautiful thing you ever laid eyes on, and her dancing has a feminine suavity, lightness, sparkle, and refinement which are simply incomparable.
Hit Alla Sizova, who seems to have made a special hit in the East, was delightful as the lady Bluebird and her partner, Yuri Soloviev, was wonderfully virile, acrobatic, and poetic all at the same time, in a tradition not unlike that of Nijinsky.
Vladilen Semenov, a fine danseur noble ; Konstantin Shatilov, a great character dancer ; and Inna Zubkovskaya, an excellent Lilac Fairy, were other outstanding members of the cast, but every member of the cast was magnificent.
The production, designed by Simon Virsaladze, was completely traditional but traditional in the right way.
It was done with great taste, was big and spacious, sumptuous as the dreams of any peasant in its courtly costumes, but sumptuous in a muted, pastel-like style, with rich, quiet harmonies of color between the costumes themselves and between the costumes and the scenery.
Evegeni Dubovskoi conducted an exceptionally large orchestra, one containing excellent soloists -- the violin solos by the concertmaster, Guy Lumia, were especially fine -- but one in which the core of traveling players and the body of men added locally had not had time to achieve much unity.
Mail orders are now being received for the series of concerts to be given this season under the auspices of the San Francisco Chamber Music Society.
The season will open at the new Hall of Flowers in Golden Gate Park on November 20 at 8:30 p.m. with a concert by the Mills Chamber Players.
Sustaining members may sign up at $25 for the ten-concert season ; annual members may attend for $16.
Participating members may attend five of the concerts for $9 ( not all ten concerts as was erroneously announced earlier in The Chronicle ).
Mail orders for the season and orders for single tickets at $2, may be addressed to the society, 1044 Chestnut Street, San Francisco 9.
San Francisco firemen busied themselves last week with their annual voluntary task of fixing up toys for distribution to needy children.
Fire Fighters Local 798, which is sponsoring the toy program for the 12th straight year, issued a call for San Franciscans to turn in discarded toys, which will be repaired by off-duty firemen.
Toys will not be collected at firehouses this year.
They will be accepted at all branches of the Bay View Federal Savings and Loan Association, at a collection center in the center of the Stonestown mall, and at the Junior Museum, 16th Street and Roosevelt Way.
From the collection centers, toys will be taken to a warehouse at 198 Second street, where they will be repaired and made ready for distribution.
Any needy family living in San Francisco can obtain toys by writing to Christmas Toys, 676 Howard street, San Francisco 5, and listing the parent's name and address and the age and sex of each child in the family between the ages of 1 and 12.
Requests must be mailed in by December 5.

For a good many seasons I've been looking at the naughty stuff on television, so the other night I thought I ought to see how immorality is doing on the other side of the fence in movies.
After all, this year's movies are next year's television shows.
So I went to see La Dolce Vita.
It has been billed as a towering monument to immorality.
All the sins of ancient Rome are said to be collected into this three-hour film.
If that's all the Romans did, it's a surprise to me that Rome fell.
After television, La Dolce Vita seems as harmless as a Gray Line tour of North Beach at night.
I cannot imagine a single scene that isn't done in a far naughtier manner on *j every week.
I believe T*v watchers will be bored.
La Dolce Vita has none of the senseless brutality or sadism of the average T*v Western.
Week in, week out, there is more sex to be seen in The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet.
There is more decadence on 77 Sunset Strip.
There are more obvious nymphomaniacs on any private-eye series.
In another respect, television viewers will feel right at home because most of the actors are unknowns.
With the exception of Lex Barker and Anita Ekberg, the credits are as unfamiliar as you'll find on the Robert Herridge Theater.
Most of the emphasis has been placed on a wild party at a seaside villa.
Producer Fellini should have looked at some of the old silent films where they really had parties ] the Dolce Vita get-together boasted a strip tease ( carried as far as a black slip ) ; a lady drunk on her hands and knees who carries the hero around on her back while he throws pillow feathers in her face ; a frigid beauty, and three silly fairies.
Put them all together and they spell out the only four-letter word I can think of : dull.
Apparently Fellini caught the crowd when its parties had begun to pall.
What a swinging group they must have been when they first started entertaining ] as a moral shocker it is a dud.
But this doesn't detract from its merit as an interesting, if not great, film.
The Chronicle's Paine Knickerbocker summed it up neatly : this is a long picture and a controversial one, but basically it is a moral, enthralling and heartbreaking description of humans who have become unlinked from life as perhaps Rome has from her traditional political, cultural and religious glories.
And when they sell it to television in a couple of years, it can be shown without editing.

And you think you have language problems.
The week went along briskly enough.
I bought a new little foreign bomb.
It is a British bomb.
Very austere yet racy.
It is very chic to drive foreign cars.
With a foreign car you must wear a cap -- it has a leather band in the back.
You must also wear a car coat.
The wardrobe for a foreign bomb is a little expensive.
But we couldn't really get along without it.
Where do you put the lighter fluid, ha, ha?
Asked the gas station man.
The present crop of small cars is enriching American humor.
Gas station people are very debonair about small cars.
When I drove a car with tail fins, I had plenty status at the wind-and-water oases.
My car gulped 20 gallons without even wiping its mouth.
This excellent foreign bomb takes only six.
When I had my big job with the double headlights and yards of chrome, the gas people were happy to see me.
Tires O*k?
Check the oil and water, sir?
They polished the windshield.
They had a loving touch.
The man stuck the nozzle in the gas tank.
What kind of car is it?
He asked gloomily.
It is a British Austin, the smallest they make.
Get much mileage?
About 35.
The gas station man sighed unhappily.
What I always say is what if somebody clobbers you in a little car like that?
Crunch, that's all she wrote.
I will die rich.
That will be $1.80, said the gas station man.
The windshield looks pretty clean.
Ah, the fair-weather friends of yesteryear ] when I wheeled about, finned fore and aft, I was the darling of the doormen.
Dollar bills skidded off my hands and they tipped their caps politely.
With a small bomb, I tuck it between Cadillacs.
( the last doorman that saw me do that should calm himself.
High blood pressure can get the best of any of us.

The gift is being presented by heirs and descendants of the Rutherford family of New Jersey, whose famous estate, Tranquility, was located near the Duncan Phyfe workshop at Andover, N. J..
Authenticated pieces of Duncan Phyfe furniture are uncommon, although millions of American homes today display pieces patterned after the style trends he set 150 years ago.
This acquisition is a matched, perfect set -- consisting of two sofas six feet long, plus six sidechairs and two armchairs.
The *j has undertaken the redecoration of the White House library as a project in connection with the work being done by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy's Fine Arts Advisory Committee to secure antiques for the presidential home.
It is the *j intention to create in the library a miniature museum of Americana before completed refurbishing is unveiled early this fall.
The room will also feature another rarity many antiquarians would consider more important than the Duncan Phyfe furniture.
The *j has found a mantlepiece attributed to Samuel Mc*intyre of Salem, Mass., an architect and woodcarver who competed for the designing of the Capitol here in 1792.
The mantel was found in a recently demolished Salem house and is being fitted over the White House library fireplace.
It will be painted to match the paneling in the room.
The *j committee's chairman in charge of the redecoration, Mrs. Henry Francis Lenygon, was in town yesterday to consult with White House staff members on the project.
Mrs. Lenygon's committee associates, announced formally yesterday by the *j in New York, include Mrs. Allen Lehman Mc*cluskey and Stephen J. Jussel, both wellknown Manhattan decorators.
Regional representatives appointed to serve from each section of the country include Frank E. Barnes of Boston.
President Kennedy couldn't stay away from his desk for the 75-minute young people's concert played on the White House lawn yesterday by the 85-piece Transylvania Symphony Orchestra from Brevard, N. C..
But he left the doors to his office open so he could hear the music.
At 4 p.m. the President left the White House to welcome the young musicians, students from the ages of 12 to 18 who spend six weeks at the Brevard Music Center summer camp, and to greet the 325 crippled, cardiac and blind children from the District area who were special guests at the concert.
It was the first in the series of Concerts for Young People by Young People to be sponsored by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy at the White House.
She was not present yesterday, however, to enjoy the music or watch the faces of the delighted audience.
She is vacationing at the Kennedy summer home in Hyannis Port, Mass., and in his welcoming remarks, the President said he was representing her.
As he approached the open bandstand, erected facing the South entrance to the Executive Mansion, the band struck up the Star Spangled Banner and followed it with Hail To The Chief.
I think they played Hail To The Chief better than the Marine Corps Band, and we are grateful to them, President Kennedy remarked after mounting the bandstand and shaking hands with conductor James Christian Pfohl.
After paying tribute to the conductor and his white-clad youthful students, President Kennedy said, as an American I have the greatest possible pride in the work that is being done in dozens of schools stretching across the United States -- schools where devoted teachers are studying with interested young men and women and opening up the whole wide horizon of serious music.
He added I think that sometimes in this country we are not aware as we should be of the extraordinary work that is being done in this field.
Displaying his knowledge of music, the New England-born President remarked that probably the best chamber music in the world is played in Vermont, by young Americans -- and here in this school where they have produced extraordinary musicians and teachers, and their work is being duplicated all across the United States.
This is a great national cultural asset, and therefore it is a great source of satisfaction to me, representing as I do today my wife, to welcome all of you here today at the White House.
As he left the bandstand to return to his office, the slender, sun-tanned Chief Executive paused along the way to shake hands with the members of the audience in wheel chairs forming the first row under the field tent set up for the guests.
He expressed surprise to learn that pretty, blonde Patricia Holbrook, 16, of Mount Rainier, had attended the Joseph P. Kennedy School for the Handicapped in Boston.
The nuns there do a wonderful work, the President commented.
Patricia now attends the C. Melvin Sharpe Health School in the District.
Each of the children invited to the concert wore a name tag marked with a red, white and blue ribbon.
They enjoyed lemonade and cookies served before and during the concert by teenage sons and daughters of members of the White House staff.
Many of the music-loving members of the President's staff gathered around the tent listening and watching the rapt attention given by the young seated audience.
And it turned out to be more of a family affair than expected.
Henry Hall Wilson, a student at the music camp 25 years ago and now on the President's staff as liaison representative with the House of Representatives, turned guest conductor for a Sousa march, the Stars and Stripes Forever.
Transylvania Symphony Conductor Pfohl said yesterday that Mrs. Kennedy's Social Secretary, Letitia Baldrige, told about plans for White House youth concerts before the National Symphony Orchestra League in Philadelphia last spring.
He said he contacted a friend, Henry Hall Wilson, on the President's staff and asked whether his orchestra could play in the series.
A flow of correspondence between Pfohl and Miss Baldrige resulted in an invitation to the 85-student North Carolina group to play the first concert.
One of the most interested students on the tour which the Brevard group took at the National Gallery yesterday following their concert at the White House, was Letitia Baldrige, social secretary to First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy.
I was an art major in college, Miss Baldrige explained.
I've been here so many times I couldn't count them.
She turned out to be a fan, too, of Margaret Bouton, the Gallery's associate curator of education.
Miss Bouton headed up one of the four groups that went on simultaneous tours after the Gallery had closed at 5 p.m..
The Brevard group of 85 arrived at the Gallery at 6 p.m., remaining for about 45 minutes.
The Brevard visitors had very little to say at the beginning of the tour but warmed up later.
They decided that they thought Rembrandt's self-portrait made him look sad ; they noticed Roman buildings in the background of Raphael's Alba Madonna and texture in a Monet painting of Rheims Cathedral.
Everybody had heard of Van Gogh, the French impressionist.
Gallery Director John Walker greeted the group, standing on one of the benches in the downstairs lobby to speak to them.
He pointed out to the young musicians that the National Gallery is the only museum in the country to have a full-time music director, Richard Bales.
I'm sure you've heard of him and his record, The Confederacy.
Along with the gallery aide who explained the various paintings and sculptures to each group, went one of the Gallery's blue-uniformed guards.
In 45 minutes, the Gallery leaders had given the students a quick rundown on art from the Renaissance to the late 19th Century.
A few of them said they preferred contemporary art.
Among the other artists, whose paintings were discussed were Boucher, Courbet, Fra Angelico.
The thing that impressed one of the visitors the most was the Gallery's rotunda fountain because it's on the second floor.
That imposing, somewhat austere, and seemingly remote collonaded building with the sphynxes perched on its threshold at 1733 16th St. nw. took on bustling life yesterday.
More than 250 Scottish Rite Masons and guests gathered in their House of the Temple to pay tribute to their most prominent leader, Albert Pike, who headed the Scottish Rite from 1859 to 1891.
They came together in the huge, high-ceilinged Council Chamber to hear the late leader eulogized.
C. Wheeler Barnes of Denver, head of the Scottish Rite in Colorado, praised Pike as a historian, author, poet, journalist, lawyer, jurist, soldier and musician, who devoted most of his mature years to the strengthening of the Masonic Order.
The ceremony ended with the laying of a wreath at the crypt of Pike in the House of the Temple.
A reception and tea followed.
About 1500 delegates are expected to register today for the biennial session of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite for the Southern Jurisdiction of the United States.
The opening session of the 5-day session will begin at 10 a.m. today.
There will be a pilgrimage to Mount Vernon at 2:30 p.m..
A wreath will be placed at the tomb of George Washington, one of this Nation's first Masons -- a past master of Washington-*alexandria Lodge 22 in Alexandria.
The marriage of John and Mary Black had clearly reached the breaking point after eight years.
John had a job in a small firm where the work was dull and monotonous.
He would come home in the evening tired and discouraged -- in no frame of mind to play with their three children, or spend much time chatting with his wife.
Hurt by his lack of interest and attention, Mary complained often that he didn't help around the house, and that he didn't really care about the family.
She accused him of ignoring her.
He in turn told her she demanded too much.
They were both discouraged, disgusted and miserable.
Mary decided she had had enough.
Without any definite plan in mind, she went to a judge to see what could be done.
The judge listened quietly as the young woman poured out her frustrations -- then discussing with her the possibility of seeking aid from Family Service before going to a lawyer.
Family Service, sharing in *j, has five agencies in the Washington area.
They offer to the people of this community case work service and counseling on a wide variety of family problems.
Because neither of them really wanted their marriage to break up, Mr. and Mrs. Black agreed to a series of interviews at Family Service of Northern Virginia, the agency nearest them.
For nearly a year, they have been receiving counseling, separately and together, in an effort to understand and overcome the antagonisms which had given rise to the possibility of divorce.
The interviews have led each of them to a new appreciation of the problems confronting the other.
They are now working together toward solving their difficulties.
John received a promotion in his firm.
He gives credit for the promotion to his new outlook on life.
Mary is cheery and gay when her husband comes home in the evenings, and the children's bed-time is frequently preceeded by a session of happy, family rough-housing.
To outsiders, the Blacks seem to be an ordinary, happy family, and they are -- but with a difference.
They know the value of being just that -- an ordinary, happy family.
Family Service has helped hundreds of families in this area.
Perhaps to some their work does not seem particularly vital.
But to the families it serves, their help cannot be measured.
Family Service could not open its doors to a single family without the financial support of the United Givers Fund.
Anticipated heavy traffic along the Skyline Drive failed to materialize yesterday, park rangers said, and those who made the trip got a leisurely view of the fall colors through skies swept clear of haze.
For crucial encounter one of the initial questions put to President Kennedy at his first news conference last January was about his attitude toward a meeting with Premier Khrushchev.
Mr. Kennedy replied : I'm hopeful that from more traditional exchanges we can perhaps find greater common ground.
The President knew that a confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev sooner or later probably was inevitable and even desirable.
But he was convinced that the realities of power -- military, economic and ideological -- were the decisive factors in the struggle with the Communists and that these could not be talked away at a heads of government meeting.
He wanted to buy time to strengthen the U. S. and its allies and to define and begin to implement his foreign policy.
Last Friday the White House announced : President Kennedy will meet with Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev in Vienna June 3 and 4.
The announcement came after a period of sharp deterioration in East-*west relations.
The heightened tension, in fact, had been a major factor in the President's change of view about the urgency of a meeting with the Soviet leader.
He was not going to Vienna to negotiate -- the simultaneous announcements in Washington and Moscow last week stressed that no formal negotiations were planned.
But Mr. Kennedy had become convinced that a personal confrontation with Mr. Khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe.
That objective set the high stakes and drama of the Vienna meeting.
Despite efforts by Washington last week to play down the significance of the meeting, it clearly was going to be one of the crucial encounters of the cold war.
Road to Vienna the U. S. and Soviet heads of Government have met three times since Sir Winston Churchill in 1953 introduced a new word into international diplomacy with his call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the summit of the nations.
The first time was in 1955 when a full-dress Big Four summit meeting produced the spirit of Geneva.
The spirit served chiefly to lull the West while Moscow made inroads into the Middle East.
In 1959 President Eisenhower and Premier Khrushchev held an informal session in the U. S..
That meeting produced the spirit of Camp David -- a spirit, it later turned out, that masked a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a Berlin settlement.
On the third occasion -- another Big Four summit session at Paris a year ago -- there was no problem of an illusory spirit.
Premier Khrushchev wrecked the conference at its initial session with a bitter denunciation of the U. S. for the *j incident.
The episode tended to confirm the U. S. belief that propaganda, the hope of one-sided concessions, and the chance to split the Allies, rather than genuine negotiation, were the Soviet leader's real aims in summitry.
Pre-inaugural position thus when Premier Khrushchev intimated even before inauguration that he hoped for an early meeting with the new President, Mr. Kennedy was confronted with a delicate problem.
Shortly before his nomination he had set forth his basic view about the problem of negotiations with the Soviet leader in these words : as long as Mr. Khrushchev is convinced that the balance of world power is shifting his way, no amount of either smiles or toughness, neither Camp David talks nor kitchen debates, can compel him to enter fruitful negotiations.
The President had set for himself the task, which he believed vital, of awakening the U. S. and its allies to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance.
He did not want the effort weakened by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary.
He wanted time, too, to review the United States' global commitments and to test both the policies he had inherited and new ones he was formulating.
Above all, he did not want to appear to be running hat in hand to Premier Khrushchev's doorstep.
Attitude flexible at the same time the President took pains not to rule out an eventual meeting with the Soviet leader.
Ideally, he knew, it should be preceded by concrete progress at lower levels.
But Mr. Kennedy saw value even in an informal meeting, provided that undue hopes were not raised in connection with it.
It would give him an opportunity to take the measure of his chief adversary in the cold war, to try to probe Mr. Khrushchev's intentions and to make clear his own views.
Moreover, an eventual meeting was desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the U. S. was not inflexible and was sparing no effort to ease international tensions.
Both elements -- the caution about a meeting, the willingness eventually to hold one -- were reflected in a letter from the President which Ambassador Llewellyn E. Thompson brought back to Russia late in February.
The letter, dated Feb. 22, was delivered to Premier Khrushchev in Novosibirsk, Siberia, on March 9.
It dealt mainly with a broad range of East-*west issues.
But it also briefly suggested the possibility of a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate were favorable and schedules permitted.
Developments over the next two months, however, caused the President to reconsider the question of the timing.
There were intense discussions in the inner councils of the White House about the advisability of an early meeting, not because the international climate was improving, but precisely because it was deteriorating alarmingly.
Deadlock on tests the President was especially concerned about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiations at Geneva.
The deadlock has been caused by the Russians' new demand for a three-man ( East, West and neutral ) directorate, and thus a veto, over the control machinery.
In the U. S., strong pressures have been building up for a resumption of tests on grounds that the Russians may be secretly testing.
Mr. Kennedy was less troubled by that possibility than by the belief that a Geneva breakdown, or even continued stalemate, would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapons to other countries as well as a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament.
There was reason to believe that Premier Khrushchev was also concerned about a possible spread of nuclear weapons, particularly to Communist China.
The question arose as to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the Soviet leader had not become urgent.
Moreover, Moscow appeared determined to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organs of all international bodies, including the U. N. Secretariat and the International Control Commission for Laos.
Mr. Kennedy was convinced that insistence on the demand would make international agreements, or even negotiations, impossible.
Developments in Cuba and Laos also suggested the advisability of an early summit meeting.
Initially the White House reaction was that the bitter exchanges with Moscow over Cuba and the conflict in Laos had dampened prospects for a meeting.
At the same time, there was increased reason for a quick meeting lest the Soviet leader, as a result of those episodes, come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the West's ability and determination to resist Communist pressure.
In Cuba, the U. S. had blundered badly and created the impression of impotency against Communist penetration even on its own doorstep.
In Laos, the picture was almost equally bad.
U. S. willingness to accept a neutral Laos may have led Premier Khrushchev to believe that other areas could be neutralized on Soviet terms.
Beyond that, Allied disagreement about military intervention in Laos -- despite warnings that they might do so -- allowed Moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic moves that greatly strengthened the pro-*communist forces.
As a result, the West is in a poor bargaining position at the current Geneva negotiations on Laos, and South Vietnam and other nations in Southeast Asia are under increased pressure.
In the light of those events, there appeared to be a real danger that Premier Khrushchev might overreach himself.
Ambassador Thompson reported from Moscow that the Soviet leader's mood was cocky and aggressive.
He has indicated that he plans new moves on Berlin before the year is out.
The President and his advisers felt that the time might have come to warn Premier Khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in areas such as Berlin, Iran or Latin America from which there would be no turning back.
It was in the midst of such White House deliberations that Premier Khrushchev on May 4 made new inquiries through the U. S. Embassy in Moscow about a meeting with the President in the near future.
Mr. Kennedy told Moscow he would give his answer by May 20 after consultation with the Allies.
The response from London, Paris and Bonn was favorable.
Firm arrangements for the meeting in Vienna were worked out in a final exchange between Moscow and Washington last week.
Apparently at the insistence of the U. S., the simultaneous announcements issued in Washington and Moscow last Friday emphasized the informal nature of the meeting.
The Washington announcement said : the President and Chairman Khrushchev understand that this meeting is not for the purpose of negotiating or reaching agreement on the major international problems that involve the interest of many other countries.
The meeting will, however, afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between them and a general exchange of views on the major issues which affect the relationships between the two countries.
The outlook the Vienna meeting will bring together a seasoned, 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who, in Mr. Kennedy's own words, is shrewd, tough, vigorous, well-informed and confident, and a 44-year-old President ( his birthday is May 29 ) with a demonstrated capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy.
The announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produced strong reactions in the U. S. of both approval and disapproval.
The approval did not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreements at Vienna.
The inclination was to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiations.
But those who were in favor of the meeting felt that a frank exchange between the two men and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary.
Mr. Khrushchev is known to rely heavily on his instincts about his adversaries and to be a shrewd judge of men.
The feeling was that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the President and that plain talk by Mr. Kennedy would give him pause.
Apart from the personal equation, another reason advanced in favor of the meeting was that too often in the past the U.*s. appeared to have been dragged reluctantly to the summit.
Premier Khrushchev has made propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end got his summit meeting anyway.
This time the initiative came, in part at least, from Washington.
Other allies consulted there was also the fact that by the time he meets Mr. Khrushchev, the President will have completed conversations with all the other principal Allied leaders.
Thus he will be in a position to disabuse the Soviet leader of any notions he may have about grave Allied disunity.
Finally, there was a wide area of agreement on the value of the President's making a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord.
There is no single issue that has aroused stronger feelings throughout the world.
If tests are to be resumed, the argument went, it is vital that the U. S. make plain that the onus belongs to the Soviet Union.
Disapproval of the meeting was based largely on the belief that the timing could hardly be worse.
After Cuba and Laos, it was argued, Mr. Khrushchev will interpret the President's consent to the meeting as further evidence of Western weakness -- perhaps even panic -- and is certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believes he holds.
Moreover, the President is meeting the Soviet leader at a time when the Administration has still not decided on the scope of America's firm foreign policy commitments.
The question was raised, for example, as to what attitude the President would take if Mr. Khrushchev proposes a broad neutral belt extending from Southeast Asia to the Middle East.
There are, so my biologist friends tell me, mechanisms of adaptation and defense that are just too complete and too satisfactory.
Mollusks are a case in point.
The shell, which served the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme, tended to cancel out the possibility of future development.
Though this may or may not be good biology, it does aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of American Catholic higher education.
There can be no doubt that the American Catholic accomplishment in the field of higher education is most impressive : our European brethren never cease to marvel at the number and the size of our colleges and universities.
The deeper wonder is how this miracle was accomplished in decades, rather than in centuries and by immigrant minorities at that.
By way of explanation we ourselves are prone to imagine that this achievement stems from the same American Catholic zeal and generosity which brought the parochial school system into existence.
There is, however, one curious discrepancy in this broad and flattering picture.
Viewing the American Catholic educational achievement in retrospect, we may indeed see it as a unified whole extending from grade school to university.
But the simple truth is that higher education has never really been an official American Catholic project ; certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system has been a matter of official policy.
Official encouragement is one thing, but the down-to-earth test is the allocation of diocesan and parochial funds.
American Catholics have responded generously to bishops' and pastors' appeals for the support necessary to create parochial schools but they have not contributed in a similar fashion to the establishment of institutions of higher learning.
They have not done so for the simple reason that such appeals have hardly ever been made.
Diocesan authorities generally have not regarded this as their direct responsibility.
All of this may be understandable enough : it is, however, in fact difficult to see how diocesan authorities could have acted otherwise.
Yet for better or for worse, the truth of the matter is that most American Catholic colleges do not owe their existence to general Catholic support but rather to the initiative, resourcefulness and sacrifices of individual religious communities.
Community esprit de corps has been the protective shell which has made the achievement possible.
To understand the past history -- and the future potential -- of American Catholic higher education, it is necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community.
It is something more than the arithmetical sum of individual totals of piety and detachment.
A religious community with a vital sense of mission achieves a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom found elsewhere.
The fact that the group orientation and group identification are founded on supernatural principles and nourished by the well-springs of devotion simply give them a deeper and more satisfying dimension.
The net result is a uniquely satisfying sense of comradeship, the kind of comradeship which sparks enthusiasm and blunts the cutting edge of sacrifice and hardship.
American Catholic colleges and universities are, in a very real sense, the product of private enterprise -- the private enterprise of religious communities.
Had it not been for such private enterprise, diocesan authorities might of course have been goaded into establishing institutions subsidized by diocesan funds and parish collections and staffed by religious as paid employees.
There is however no point in speculating about such a possibility : the fact of the matter is that our institutions of higher learning owe their existence to a spirit not unlike that which produces the family business.
This family-community spirit is the real explanation of the marvel of our achievement.
It is this spirit which explains some of the anomalies of American Catholic higher education, in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some areas.
I think for example of three women's colleges with pitifully small enrollments, clustered within a few miles of a major Catholic university, which is also co-educational.
This is not an isolated example ; this aspect of the total picture has been commented upon often enough.
It would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot.
Apart, however, from the question of wasteful duplication, there is another aspect of the family business spirit in American Catholic higher education which deserves closer scrutiny.
For while the past needs of the Church in this country may have been adequately met by collegiate institutions, which in temper and tone closely resembled junior colleges and finishing schools, it would seem that today's need is for the college which more closely resembles the university in its pursuit of excellence.
At the earlier pre-academic excellence stage of Catholic education, the operation could be conducted on an intra-mural community basis.
But with today's demand for professional qualifications and specialized training, the need for outsiders becomes more pressing.
The problem is not merely that more outside teachers are needed but that a different brand is called for.
Commenting on the earlier stage, the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors ( in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making ) noted that the term teacher-employee ( as opposed to, e.g., maintenance employee ) was a not inapt description.
Today however, the outsider is likely to have professional qualifications of the highest order ( otherwise the college would not be interested in hiring him ) and to be acclimatized to the democratic processes of the secular or state university.
And while no one expects total democracy on the academic scene, the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship drawn on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement.
In the above mentioned report of the Notre Dame Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, the basic outlook of the new breed of lay faculty emerges very clearly in the very statement of the problem as the members see it : even with the best of intentions he ( the President of the university ) is loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which, considered ( as it must be by him ) in individual terms, is inhomogeneous, mortal and of extremely varying temperament, interests and capabilities.
It is natural that he should turn for his major support to a select and dedicated few from the organization which actually owns the university and whose goals are, in their opinion, identified with its highest good and ( to use that oft-repeated phrase ) the attainment of excellence.
The pattern here pictured is clearly not peculiar to Notre Dame : it is simply that the paradox involved in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually owns it, becomes more obvious where there is a larger and more distinguished outside faculty.
It is particularly interesting that those who framed the report should refer to the organization which actually owns the university : this seems to show an awareness of the fact that there is more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension.
But in any case, one does not have to read very closely between the lines to realize that the situation is not regarded as a particularly happy one.
Outside faculty members want to be considered partners in the academic enterprise and not merely paid employees of a family business.
There are two reasons why failure to come to grips with this demand could be fatal to the future of the Catholic university.
In the first place there is the obvious problem of recruiting high caliber personnel.
Word spreads rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession, much given to attending meetings and conferences.
Expressions of even low-key dissatisfaction by a Catholic college faculty member has the effect of confirming the already existing stereotype.
In the academic world there is seldom anything so dramatic as a strike or a boycott : all that happens is that the better qualified teacher declines to gamble two or three years of his life on the chance that conditions at the Catholic institution will be as good as those elsewhere.
To appreciate the nature of the gamble, it should be realized that while college teaching is almost a public symbol of security, that security does not come as quickly or as automatically as it does in an elementary school system or in the Civil Service.
Much has been made of the fact that major Catholic institutions now guarantee firm tenure.
This is a significant advance but its import should not be exaggerated.
When a man invests a block of his years at a university without gaining the coveted promotion, not only is he faced with the problem of starting over but there is also a certain depreciation in the market value of his services.
A man does not make that kind of gamble if he suspects that one or more of the limited number of tenure positions is being reserved for members of the family.
Just as it is possible to exaggerate the drawing power of the new tenure practices, it is also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salaries paid by major Catholic institutions.
Adequate compensation is indispensable.
Yet adequate compensation -- and particularly merely adequate compensation is no substitute for those intangibles which cause a man to sacrifice part of his earning potential by taking up college teaching in the first place.
Broadly speaking the total Catholic atmosphere is such an intangible but the larger demand is for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university.
Religious who derive their own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community are prone to underestimate both the layman's reservoir of idealism and his need for this identification.
There is no need here to spell out the conditions of creative teaching except to point out that, at the college level, the sense of community and of community responsibility is even more necessary than it is at other levels.
The college teacher needs the stimulus of communication with other faculty members but he also needs to feel that such communication, even informal debates over the luncheon table, are a contribution to the total good of the institution.
But this in turn means that decisions are not merely imposed from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation.
The second reason for being concerned with the dichotomy between faculty members who are part of the in-group that owns and operates the institution and those who are merely paid employees, is, therefore, the baneful effect on the caliber of the teaching itself.
This is a problem that goes considerably beyond questions of salary and tenure.
Yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control, there are nevertheless certain suggestions which seem to be in order.
The first is a negative warning : there is no point in the creation of faculty committees and advisory boards with high-sounding titles but no real authority.
In the case of academic personnel the feeling of participation can hardly be faked.
Competent teachers are well versed in the technique of leading students to pre-set conclusions without destroying the students' illusion that they are making their own decisions.
Those who have served as faculty advisers are too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanisms of student government to be taken in by busy-work and ersatz decision making.
In any case it is by no means clear that formally structured organs of participation are what is called for at all.
In the Notre Dame report, reference was made to the fact that faculty members were reduced to luncheon-table communication.
In itself there is nothing wrong with this form of participation : the only difficulty on the Catholic campus is that those faculty members who are in a position to implement policy, i.e., members of the religious community which owns and administers the institution, have their own eating arrangements.
Sen. John L. Mc*clellan of Arkansas and Rep. David Martin of Nebraska are again beating the drums to place the unions under the anti-monopoly laws.
Once more the fallacious equation is advanced to argue that since business is restricted under the anti-monopoly laws, there must be a corresponding restriction against labor unions : the law must treat everybody equally.
Or, in the words of Anatole France, the law in its majestic equality must forbid the rich, as well as the poor, from begging in the streets and sleeping under bridges.
The public atmosphere that has been generated which makes acceptance of this law a possibility stems from the disrepute into which the labor movement has fallen as a result of Mr. Mc*clellan's hearings into corruption in labor-management relations and, later, into the jurisdictional squabbles that plagued industrial relations at the missile sites.
The Senator was shocked by stoppages over allegedly trivial disputes that delayed our missile program.
In addition, disclosures that missile workers were earning sums far in excess of what is paid for equivalent work elsewhere provoked his indignation on behalf of the American taxpayer who was footing the bill.
It is now disclosed that the taxpayer not only pays for high wages, but he pays the employers' strike expenses when the latter undertakes to fight a strike.
Business Week ( Aug. 9, 1961 ) reports that the United Aircraft Company, against which the International Association of Machinists had undertaken a strike, decided to keep its plants operating.
The company incurred some $10 million of expenses attributable to four factors : advertising to attract new employees, hiring and training them, extra overtime, and defective work performed by the new workers.
The company has billed the United States Government for $7,500,000 of these expenses under the Defense Department regulation allowing costs of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor's business.
Rep. Frank Kowalski of Connecticut has brought this problem to the attention of the Armed Services Committee.
The committee remains unresponsive.
Neither has Congressman Martin nor Senator Mc*clellan been heard from on the matter ; they are preoccupied with ending labor abuses by extending the anti-monopoly laws to the unions.
The recent publicity attending the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturers has evoked a new respect for the anti-trust laws that is justified neither by their rationale nor by the results they have obtained.
The anti-trust laws inform a business that it must compete, but along completely undefined lines ; it must play a game in which there never is a winner.
The fact is that any business that wants to operate successfully cannot follow the law.
Hypocrisy thus becomes the answer to a foolish public policy.
Let us look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which General Electric, Westinghouse and a number of other manufacturers were recently convicted of engaging in a conspiracy to rig prices and allocate the market.
The industry is so structured that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charges are allocated -- whether marginal or average pricing is applied.
The problem becomes even more complex where an enterprise is engaged in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment.
Accounting procedures can be varied to provide a rationale for almost any price.
Naturally, enterprises of the size of General Electric are in a position to structure their prices in such a way that the relatively small competitors can be forced to the wall in a very short time.
Should these giants really flex their competitive muscles, they would become the only survivors in the industry.
Uncle Sam would then accuse them of creating a monopoly by unfair competition.
But if they show self-restraint, they don't get the orders.
Under the circumstances, the only protection for the relatively small manufacturers is to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giants for which the latter were convicted.
Engaging in such a conspiracy was an act of mercy by the giants.
The paradox implicit in the whole affair is shown by the demand of the government, after the conviction, that General Electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce prices so low as to compete seriously with its fellows.
In other words, the anti-trust laws, designed to reduce prices to the consumer on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.
And which theory would govern the enforcers of the law on Sunday?
The question might be asked : don't the managements of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturers know these facts?
Why did they engage in a flood of mea culpas, throw a few scapegoats to the dogs and promise to be good boys thereafter, expressing their complete confidence in the laws?
The past usefulness of the anti-trust laws to management was explained by Thurman Arnold, in The Folklore of Capitalism, back in 1937.
He wrote : ( P. 211 ) the anti-trust laws were the answer of a society which unconsciously felt the need of great organizations, and at the same time had to deny them a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure.
( P. 214 ) anti-trust laws became the greatest protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship.
( P. 215 ) when corporate abuses were attacked, it was done on the theory that criminal penalties would be invoked rather than control.
In this manner, every scheme for direct control broke to pieces on the great protective rock of the anti-trust laws.
( Pp. 228-229 ) in any event, it is obvious that the anti-trust laws did not prevent the formation of some of the greatest financial empires the world has ever known, held together by some of the most fantastic ideas, all based on the fundamental notion that a corporation is an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government.
This escape from control has led to management's evaluating the risk of occasional irrational prosecution as worth while.
A plea of nolo contendere, followed by a nominal fine, after all is a small price to pay for this untrammeled license.
( the penalties handed out in the electrical case, which included jail sentences, were unprecedented in anti-trust prosecutions, perhaps because the conspirators had displayed unusual ineptness in their pricing activities.
) if a substitute mechanism is needed for the control of a fictitious impersonal market, quite obviously some method must be devised for representing the public interest.
A secret conspiracy of manufacturers is hardly such a vehicle.
However, one can argue that no such control is necessary as long as one pretends that the anti-trust laws are effective and rational.
Quite clearly the anti-trust laws are neither effective nor rational -- and yet the argument goes that they should be extended to the labor union.
Those who favor placing trade unions under anti-trust laws imply that they are advocating a brand new reform.
Before 1933, individuals who opposed trade unions and collective bargaining said so in plain English.
The acceptance of collective bargaining as a national policy in 1934, implicit in the writing of Section 7*a of the National Industrial Recovery Act, has made it impolitic to oppose collective bargaining in principle.
The Wagner Act, the Taft-*hartley Act and the Landrum-*griffin Act all endorse the principle of collective bargaining.
The basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system is the removal of wages from competition.
If a union cannot perform this function, then collective bargaining is being palmed off by organizers as a gigantic fraud.
The tortured reasoning that unions use to deny their ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor is one of the things that create a legal profession.
The problem must be faced squarely.
If laborers are merely commodities competing against each other in a market place like so many bags of wheat and corn ( unsupported, by the way, by any agricultural subsidy ), then they may be pardoned for reacting with complete antagonism to a system that imposes such status upon them.
Human labor was exactly that -- a commodity -- in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century America.
As early as 1776, Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth Of Nations : we have no acts of Parliament against combining to lower the price of work ; but many against combining to raise it.
Eighteenth-century England, upon whose customs our common law was built, had outlawed unions as monopolies and conspiracies.
In 1825, the Boston house carpenters' strike for a ten-hour day was denounced by the organized employers, who declared : it is considered that all combinations by any classes of citizens intended to effect the value of labor tend to convert all its branches into monopolies.
There were no pious hypocrisies then about being for collective bargaining, but against labor monopoly.
The courts shared the opinion of the employers.
In people vs. Fisher, Justice Savage of the New York Supreme Court declared : without any officious and improper interference on the subject, the price of labor or the wages of mechanics will be regulated by the demand for the manufactured article and the value of that which is paid for it ; but the right does not exist to raise the wages of the mechanic by any forced and artificial means.
Compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how Congressman Martin, according to the Daily Labor Report of Sept. 19, 1961, defends the necessity of enacting anti-trust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fixing of wages, production or prices and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and his employees to contract on wages, hours and conditions of employment.
Senator Mc*clellan is proposing the application of anti-trust measures to unions in transportation.
His bill, allegedly aimed at Hoffa, would amend the Sherman, Clayton and Norris-*la*guardia acts to authorize the issuance of federal injunctions in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union -- even a sister local in the same international.
Paradoxically, the same week in which Senator Mc*clellan was attempting to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation, the Civil Aeronautics Board was assuring the airlines that if they met in concert to eliminate many costly features of air travel, the action would not be deemed a violation of the anti-trust act.
Indeed, it is in the field of transportation that Congress has most frequently granted employers exemption from the anti-trust laws ; for example, the organization of steamship conferences to set freight rates and the encouragement of railroads to seek mergers.
At the very moment that every attempt is being made to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation, a drive is on to abolish collective bargaining under the guise of extending the anti-monopoly laws to unions who want no more than to continue to set wages in the same way that ship operators set freight rates.
The passage of the Sherman Act was aimed at giant monopolies.
It was most effective against trade unions.
In the famous Danbury Hatters case, a suit was brought against the union by the Loewe Company for monopolistic practices, e.g., trying to persuade consumers not to purchase the product of the struck manufacturer.
The suit against the union was successful and many workers lost their homes to pay off the judgment.
In 1914, the Clayton Act attempted to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by stating that human labor was not to be considered a commodity.
The law could not suspend economics.
Labor remained a commodity -- but presumably a privileged one granted immunization from the anti-trust laws.
The courts, by interpretation, emasculated the act.
In 1922, the United Mine Workers struck the Coronado Coal Company.
The company sued under the anti-trust laws, alleging that the union's activity interfered with the movement of interstate commerce.
( what other purpose could a striking union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the struck enterprise?
) the court first ruled that the strike constituted only an indirect interference with commerce.
The nation the three-front war at a closed-door session on Capitol Hill last week, Secretary of State Christian Herter made his final report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on U.*s. affairs abroad.
Afterward, Tennessee's Democratic Senator Albert Gore summed it up for newsmen.
What Herter presented, said Gore, was not a very encouraging review.
That was something of an understatement in a week when the underlying conflict between the West and Communism erupted on three fronts.
While Communists were undermining United Nations efforts to rescue the Congo from chaos, two other Communist offensives stirred the Eisenhower Administration into emergency conferences and serious decisions.
1 Cuba.
Hours after a parade of his new Soviet tanks and artillery, Dictator Fidel Castro suddenly confronted the U.*s. with a blunt and drastic demand : within 48 hours, the U.*s. had to reduce its embassy and consulate staffs in Cuba to a total of eleven persons ( the embassy staff alone totaled 87 U.*s. citizens, plus 120 Cuban employees ).
President Eisenhower held an 8:30 a.m. meeting with top military and foreign-policy advisers, decided to break off diplomatic relations immediately.
There is a limit to what the United States in self-respect can endure, said the President.
That limit has now been reached.
Through Secretary Herter, Ike offered President-elect Kennedy an opportunity to associate his new Administration with the breakoff decision.
Kennedy, through Secretary-designate of State Dean Rusk, declined.
He thus kept his hands free for any action after Jan. 20, although reaction to the break was generally favorable in the U.*s. and Latin America ( see the hemisphere ).
2 Laos.
After a White House huddle between the President and top lieutenants, the Defense Department reacted sharply to a cry from the pro-*western government of Laos that several battalions of Communist troops had invaded Laos from North Viet Nam.
In view of the present situation in Laos, said the Pentagon's announcement, we are taking normal precautionary actions to increase the readiness of our forces in the Pacific.
Cutting short a holiday at Hong Kong, the aircraft carriers Lexington and Bennington steamed off into the South China Sea, accompanied by a swarm of destroyers, plus troopships loaded with marines.
On the U.*s.'s island base of Okinawa, Task Force 116, made up of Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force units, got braced to move southward on signal.
But by week's end the Laotian cry of invasion was read as an exaggeration ( see foreign news ), and the U.*s. was agreeing with its cautious British and French allies that a neutralist -- rather than a pro-*western -- government might be best for Laos.
French & Indians.
There was a moral of sorts in the Laotian situation that said much about all other cold-war fronts.
Political, economic and military experts were all agreed that chaotic, mountainous little Laos was the last place in the world to fight a war -- and they were probably right.
It would be like fighting the French and Indian War all over again, said one military man.
But why was Laos the new Southeast Asian battleground?
At Geneva in 1954, to get the war in Indo-*china settled, the British and French gave in to Russian and Communist Chinese demands and agreed to the setting up of a Communist state, North Viet Nam -- which then, predictably, became a base for Communist operations against neighboring South Viet Nam and Laos.
The late Secretary of State John Foster Dulles considered the 1954 Geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement, saw that resolution would be needed to keep it from becoming a calamity for the West.
He began the diplomatic discussions that resulted in the establishment of *j.
The important thing from now on, he said, is not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern Viet Nam from leading to the extension of Communism throughout Southeast Asia.
Russian tanks and artillery parading through the streets of Havana, Russian intrigue in the Congo, and Russian arms drops in Laos ( using the same Ilyushin transports that were used to carry Communist agents to the Congo ) made it plain once more that the cold war was all of a piece in space and time.
Soviet Premier Khrushchev sent New Year's hopes for peace to President-elect Kennedy, and got a cool acknowledgment in reply.
Considering the state of the whole world, the cold war's three exposed fronts did not seem terribly ominous ; but, in Senator Gore's words, it was not a very encouraging situation that would confront John F. Kennedy on Inauguration Day.
The Congress turmoil in the House as the 87th Congress began its sessions last week, liberal Democrats were ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gates controlled by the House Rules Committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor.
The liberal pressure bloc ( which coyly masquerades under the name Democratic Study Group ) had fought the committee before, and had always lost.
This time, they were much better prepared and organized, and the political climate was favorable.
They had the unspoken support of President-elect Kennedy, whose own legislative program was menaced by the Rules Committee bottleneck.
And counting noses, they seemed to have the votes to work their will.
Deadly deadlock.
There were two possible methods of breaching the conservative barriers around the Rules Committee : 1 ) to pack it with additional liberals and break the conservative-liberal deadlock, or 2 ) to remove one of the conservatives -- namely Mississippi's 14-term William Meyers Colmer ( pronounced Calmer ).
Caucusing, the liberals decided to go after Colmer, which actually was the more drastic course, since seniority in the House is next to godliness.
A dour, gangling man with a choppy gait, Colmer looks younger than his 70 years, has gradually swung from a moderate, internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative.
He is generally and initially suspicious of any federal project, unless it happens to benefit his Gulf Coast constituents.
He is, of course, a segregationist, but he says he has never made an anti-*negro speech.
For 20 years he has enjoyed his power on the Rules Committee.
There his vote, along with those of Chairman Howard Smith, the courtly Virginia judge, and the four Republican members, could and often did produce a 6-6 deadlock that blocked far-out, Democratic-sponsored welfare legislation ( a tactic often acceptable to the Rayburn-*johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrassing votes ).
Equal treatment.
There was sufficient pretext to demand Colmer's ouster : he had given his lukewarm support to the anti-*kennedy electors in Mississippi.
Reprisals are not unheard of in such situations, but the recent tendency has been for the Congress to forgive its prodigal sons.
In 1949 the Dixiecrats escaped unscathed after their 1948 rebellion against Harry Truman, and in 1957, after Congressman Adam Clayton Powell campaigned for Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, his fellow Democrats did not touch his committee assignments, although they did strip him temporarily of his patronage.
( in the heat of the anti-*colmer drive last week, Judge Smith threatened reprisal against Powell.
Said he : we will see whether whites and Negroes are treated the same around here.
) but Speaker Sam Rayburn, after huddling in Palm Beach with President-elect Kennedy, decided that this year something had to be done about the Rules Committee -- and that he was the only man who could do anything effective.
In a tense, closed-door session with Judge Smith, Rayburn attempted to work out a compromise : to add three new members to the Rules Committee ( two Democrats, including one Southerner, and one Republican ).
Smith flatly rejected the offer, and Mister Sam thereupon decided to join the rebels.
The next morning he summoned a group of top Democrats to his private office and broke the news : he would lead the fight to oust Colmer, whom he is said to regard as an inferior man.
News of Rayburn's commitment soon leaked out.
When Missouri's Clarence Cannon got the word, he turned purple.
Unconscionable ] he shouted, and rushed off to the Speaker's Room to object : a dangerous precedent ] Cannon, a powerful, conservative man, brought welcome support to the Smith-*colmer forces : as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he holds over each member the dreadful threat of excluding this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel projects.
Sitting quietly on an equally big pork barrel was another Judge Smith ally, Georgia's Carl Vinson, chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
Threat of war.
As the battle raged in the cloakrooms and caucuses, it became clear that Judge Smith could lose.
His highest count of supporters numbered 72 -- and he needed nearly twice that number to control the 260-member Democratic caucus.
The liberals, smelling blood, were faced with the necessity of winning three big votes -- in the Democratic Committee on Committees, in the full party caucus, and on the floor of the House -- before they could oust Colmer.
( one big question : if Colmer was to be purged, what should the House do about the other three senior Mississippians who supported the maverick electors?
) in all three arenas, they seemed certain of victory -- especially with Sam Rayburn applying his whiplash.
But in the prospect of winning the battle loomed the specter of losing a costlier war.
If the Southerners were sufficiently aroused, they could very well cut the Kennedy legislative program to ribbons from their vantage point of committee chairmanships, leaving Sam Rayburn leading a truncated, unworkable party.
With that possibility in mind, Arkansas' Wilbur Mills deliberately delayed calling a meeting of the Committee on Committees, and coolheaded Democrats sought to bring Rayburn and Smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise.
Here are two old men, mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone, said a House Democratic leader.
One wants a little more power, and the other doesn't want to give up any.
Battle in the senate the Senate launched the 87th Congress with its own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle, but in contrast with the House's guerrilla war it seemed as pro forma as a Capitol guide's speech.
Question at issue : how big a vote should be necessary to restrict Senate debate -- and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibusters?
A wide-ranging, bipartisan force -- from Minnesota's Democratic Hubert Humphrey to Massachusetts' Republican Leverett Saltonstall -- was drawn up against a solid phalanx of Southern Democrats, who have traditionally used the filibuster to stop civil rights bills.
New Mexico's Clint Anderson offered a resolution to change the Senate's notorious Rule 22 to allow three-fifths of the Senators present and voting to cut off debate, instead of the current hard-to-get two-thirds.
Fair Dealer Humphrey upped the ante, asked cloture power for a mere majority of Senators.
Georgia's Dick Russell objected politely, and the battle was joined.
Privately, the liberals admitted that the Humphrey amendment had no chance of passage.
Privately, they also admitted that their hopes for Clint Anderson's three-fifths modification depended on none other than Republican Richard Nixon.
In 1957 Nixon delivered a significant opinion that a majority of Senators had the power to adopt new rules at the beginning of each new Congress, and that any rules laid down by previous Congresses were not binding.
Armed with the Nixon opinion, the Senate liberals rounded up their slim majority and prepared to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week.
Hopefully, the perennial battle of Rule 22 then would be fought to a settlement once and for all.
Republicans last act since Election Day, Vice President Richard Nixon had virtually retired -- by his own wish -- from public view.
But with the convening of the new Congress, he was the public man again, presiding over the Senate until John Kennedy's Inauguration.
One day last week, Nixon faced a painful constitutional chore that required him to officiate at a joint session of Congress to hear the official tally of the Electoral College vote, and then to make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeated him in the tight 1960 presidential election.
Nixon fulfilled his assignment with grace, then went beyond the required sufficient declaration.
This is the first time in 100 years that a candidate for the presidency announced the result of an election in which he was defeated, he said.
The Masters golf tournament proved last Monday what it can do to the strongest men and the staunchest nerves.
Gary Player, the small, trim South African, was the eventual winner, but in all his 25 years he never spent a more harrowing afternoon as he waited for the victory to drop in his lap.
Arnold Palmer, the defending champion, lost his title on the 72nd hole after a few minutes of misfortune that left even his fellow pros gaping in disbelief.
Just when you think you have it licked, this golf course can get up and bite you, Player had said one afternoon midway through the tournament.
And that is just what happened on the last few holes.
The Augusta National Golf Club Course got up and bit both Player and Palmer.
Player was the first to feel its teeth.
After playing a splendid first nine holes in 34 -- two strokes under par -- on this fifth and final day of the tournament ( Sunday's fourth round had been washed out by a violent rainstorm when it was only half completed ), Player's game rapidly fell to pieces.
He bogeyed the 10th.
After a journey through woods and stream he double-bogeyed the 13th.
He bogeyed the 15th by missing a short putt and finally scrambled through the last three holes without further mishap for a 2-over-par 74 and a 72-hole total of 280.
As he signed his scorecard and walked off the course, Player was almost in tears.
He could read on the nearby scoreboard that Palmer, by then playing the 15th hole, was leading him by a stroke.
Palmer had started the round four strokes behind Player, and at one point in the afternoon had trailed by as many as six strokes.
Now all he had to do was finish in even par to collect the trophy and the biggest single paycheck in golf.
When Palmer hit a good straight drive up the fairway on the 72nd hole, he seemed to have the championship won.
But the seven-iron shot he used to approach the green strayed into a bunker and lodged in a slight depression.
In trying to hit it out with a sand wedge Palmer bounced the ball over the green, past spectators and down the slope toward a *j tower.
Afterwards, Palmer told Charlie Coe, his last-round partner, that he simply played the hole too fast.
He did seem hasty on his second and third shots, but then there was an agonizing wait of several minutes while Coe graciously putted out, giving Palmer a chance to recover his composure, which he had quite visibly lost.
When the shaken Palmer finally did hit his fourth shot, he overshot the hole by 15 feet.
Palmer was now putting merely for a tie, and Player, who was sitting beside his wife and watching it all on television in Tournament Chairman Clifford Roberts' clubhouse apartment, stared in amazement when Palmer missed the putt.
Palmer's 281 for the four rounds at Augusta was a comfortable four strokes ahead of the next closest pro, but it was barely good enough for a second-place tie with Coe.
The lean and leathery Oklahoma amateur, who has been playing topnotch tournament golf for many years, refused to let the Masters jitters overtake him and closed the tournament with his second straight 69.
End at seven until late last Saturday afternoon Palmer had played seven consecutive rounds of golf at the Masters -- four last year and three this -- without ever being out of first place.
As evening approached and Palmer finished his Saturday round with a disappointing one-over-par 73, this remarkable record was still intact, thanks to his Thursday and Friday rounds of 68 and 69.
His three-round total of 210 was three strokes better than the next best score, a 213 by Bill Collins, the tall and deliberate Baltimorean who had been playing very well all winter long.
But Palmer knew, as did everybody else at Augusta, that his streak was about to be broken.
Half an hour after he finished his round, Player holed out at the 18th green with a 69 and a three-round total of 206, four strokes ahead of Palmer.
More than a streak had ended.
Long after the erratic climate and the washed-out final round on Sunday have become meteorological footnotes, the 1961 Masters will be remembered as the scene of the mano a mano between Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.
Unlike most such sports rivalries, it appeared to have developed almost spontaneously, although this was not exactly the case.
When the winter tour began at Los Angeles last January there was no one in sight to challenge Palmer's towering prestige.
As if to confirm his stature, he quickly won three of the first eight tournaments.
Player won only one.
But as the tour reached Pensacola a month ago, Player was leading Palmer in official winnings by a few hundred dollars, and the rest of the field was somewhere off in nowhere.
On the final round at Pensacola, the luck of the draw paired Palmer and Player in the same threesome and, although it was far from obvious at the time, the gallery was treated to the first chapter of what promises to be one of the most exciting duels in sport for a long time to come.
On that final Sunday at Pensacola neither Palmer nor Player was leading the tournament and, as it turned out, neither won it.
But whichever of these two finished ahead of the other would be the undisputed financial leader of the tour.
Player immediately proved he was not in the least awed by the dramatic proximity of Palmer.
He outplayed Palmer all around the course and finished with a tremendous 65 to Palmer's 71.
Thereafter, until the Masters, Player gradually increased his lead over Palmer in winnings and added one more tournament victory at Miami.
When they reached Augusta last week, together they had won five of the 13 tournaments to date.
Instant rivalry on Thursday, the first day of the Masters, the contest between Palmer and Player developed instantly.
It was a dismal, drizzly day but a good one on which to score over the Augusta National course.
The usually skiddy greens were moist and soft, so the golfers were able to strike their approach shots boldly at the flag-stick and putt firmly toward the hole without too much worry about the consequences.
Palmer's 4-under-par 68 got him off to an early lead, which he shared with Bob Rosburg.
But Player was only one stroke back, with a 69.
Even so, it was still not clear to many in the enormous horde of spectators -- unquestionably the largest golf crowd ever -- that this tournament was to be, essentially, a match between Palmer and Player.
A lot of people were still thinking about Jack Nicklaus, the spectacular young amateur, who had a 70 ; or Ken Venturi, who had a somewhat shaky 72 but was bound to do better ; or Rosburg, whose accurate short game and supersensitive putter can overcome so many of Augusta's treacheries ; or even old Byron Nelson, whose excellent 71 made one wonder if he had solved the geriatric aspects of golf.
( on Thursday nobody except Charlie Coe was thinking of Charlie Coe.
) on Friday, a day as cloudless and lovely as Thursday had been gray and ugly, the plot of the tournament came clearly into focus.
Rosburg had started early in the day, and by the time Palmer and Player were on the course -- separated, as they were destined to be for the rest of the weekend, by about half an hour -- they could see on the numerous scoreboards spotted around the course that Rosburg, who ended with a 73, was not having a good day.
As Player began his second round in a twosome with amateur Bill Hyndman, his share of the gallery was not conspicuously large for a contender.
Player began with a birdie on the first hole, added five straight pars and then another birdie at the 9th.
On the back nine he began to acquire the tidal wave of a gallery that stayed with him the rest of the tournament.
He birdied the 13th, the 15th and the 18th -- five birdies, one bogey and 12 pars for a 68.
Starting half an hour behind Player in company with British Open Champion Kel Nagle, Palmer birdied the 2nd, the 9th, the 13th and the 16th -- four birdies, one bogey and 13 pars for a 69.
The roar of Palmer's gallery as he sank a thrilling putt would roll out across the parklike landscape of Augusta, only to be answered moments later by the roar of Player's gallery for a similar triumph.
At one point late in the day, when Palmer was lining up a 25-foot putt on the 16th, a thunderous cheer from the direction of the 18th green unmistakably announced that Player had birdied the final hole.
Without so much as a grimace or a gesture to show that he had noticed ( although he later admitted that he had ) Palmer proceeded to sink his 25-footer, and his gallery sent its explosive vocalization rolling back along the intervening fairways in reply.
The boldness of champions anyone who now doubted that a personal duel was under way had only to watch how these exceptionally gifted golfers were playing this most difficult golf course.
It is almost axiomatic that golfers who dominate the game of golf for any period of time attack their shots with a vehemence bordering on violence.
The bad luck that can so often mar a well-played round of golf is simply overpowered and obliterated by the contemptuous boldness of these champions.
Bob Jones played that way.
Byron Nelson did, Hogan did.
And last week at the Masters Palmer and Player did.
As the third round of the tournament began on Saturday and the duel was resumed in earnest, it was Player's superior aggressiveness that carried him into the lead.
This day Palmer had started first.
As Player stepped on the first tee he knew that Palmer had birdied the first two holes and already was 2 under par for the day.
Player immediately proceeded to follow suit.
In fact, he went on to birdie the 6th and 8th as well, to go 4 under par for the first eight holes.
But Player's real test came on the ninth hole, a downhill dogleg to the left measuring 420 yards.
He hit a poor tee shot, pulling it off into the pine woods separating the 9th and first fairways.
Having hit one of the trees, the ball came to rest not more than 160 yards out.
Player then had the choice of punching the ball safely out of the woods to the 9th fairway and settling for a bogey 5, or gambling.
The latter involved hitting a full four-wood out to the first fairway and toward the clubhouse, hoping to slice it back to the deeply bunkered 9th green.
I was hitting the ball well, Player said later, and I felt strong.
When you're playing like that you'd better attack.
Player attacked with his four-wood and hit a shot that few who saw it will ever forget.
It struck the 9th green on the fly and stopped just off the edge.
From there he chipped back and sank his putt for a par 4.
Palmer, meanwhile, had been having his troubles.
They started on the 4th hole, a 220-yard par-3.
On this day the wind had switched 180-degrees from the northwest to the southeast, and nearly every shot on the course was different from the previous few days.
At the 4th tee Palmer chose to hit a one-iron when a three-wood was the proper club, so he put the ball in a bunker in front of the green.
His bogey 4 on this hole and subsequent bogeys at 5 and 7 along with a birdie at 8 brought him back to even par.
Starting the second nine, Palmer was already four strokes behind Player and knew it.
When Mickey Charles Mantle, the New York Yankees' man of muscle, drives a home run 450 feet into the bleachers, his feat touches upon the sublime.
When Roger Eugene Maris, Mantle's muscular teammate, powers four home runs in a double-header, his performance merits awe.
But when tiny, 145-pound Albert Gregory Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels, who once caught three straight fly balls in center field because, as a teammate explained, the other team thought no one was out there, hits seven home runs in four months ( three more than his total in 1958, 1959, and 1960 ), his achievement borders on the ridiculous.
This is Baseball 1961.
This is the year home runs ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous.
It is the year when ( 1 ) amiable Jim Gentile of the Baltimore Orioles ambled to the plate in consecutive innings with the bases loaded and, in unprecedented style, delivered consecutive grand-slam home runs ; ( 2 ) Willie Mays of the San Francisco Giants borrowed a teammate's bat and became the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home runs in a game ; ( 3 ) the Milwaukee Braves tied a major-league record with fourteen home runs in three games and lost two of them ; and ( 4 ) catcher Johnny Blanchard of the New York Yankees matched a record with home runs in four successive times at bat, two of them as a pinch-hitter.
Pitchers grumble about lively balls and lively bats, the shrinking strike zone, and the fact that the knock-down pitch is now illegal.
Experts point to the thinning of pitching talent in the American League caused by expansion.
Whatever the reasons, not in 30 years has a single season produced such thunderous assaults upon the bureau of baseball records, home-run division.
Of all the records in peril, one stands apart, dramatic in its making, dramatic in its endurance, and now, doubly dramatic in its jeopardy.
This, of course, is baseball's most remarkable mark : the 60 home runs hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure, the incredible athlete, George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth of the Yankees.
Since 1927, fewer than a dozen men have made serious runs at Babe Ruth's record and each, in turn, has been thwarted.
What ultimately frustrated every challenger was Ruth's amazing September surge.
In the final month of the 1927 season, he hit seventeen home runs, a closing spurt never matched.
Double threat : always, in the abortive attacks upon Ruth's record, one man alone -- a Jimmy Foxx ( 58 in 1932 ) or a Hank Greenberg ( 58 in 1938 ) or a Hack Wilson ( 56 in 1930 ) -- made the bid.
But now, for the first time since Lou Gehrig ( with 47 home runs ) spurred Ruth on in 1927, two men playing for the same team have zeroed in on 60.
Their names are Mantle and Maris, their team is the Yankees, and their threat is real.
After 108 games in 1927, Ruth had 35 home runs.
After 108 games in 1961, Mickey Mantle has 43, Roger Maris 41.
Extend Mantle's and Maris's present paces over the full 1961 schedule of 162 games, and, mathematically, each will hit more than 60 home runs.
This is the great edge the two Yankees have going for them.
To better Ruth's mark, neither needs a spectacular September flourish.
All Mantle needs is eight more home runs in August and ten in September, and he will establish a new record.
In Ruth's day -- and until this year -- the schedule was 154 games.
Baseball commissioner Ford Frick has ruled that Ruth's record will remain official unless it is broken in 154 games.
) even on the basis of 154 games, this is the ideal situation, insists Hank Greenberg, now vice-president of the Chicago White Sox.
It has to be easier with two of them.
How can you walk Maris to get to Mantle?
Roommates : neither Mantle nor Maris, understandably, will predict 60 home runs for himself.
Although both concede they would like to hit 60, they stick primarily to the baseball player's standard quote : the important thing is to win the pennant.
But one thing is for certain : there is no dissension between Mantle, the American League's Most Valuable Player in 1956 and 1957, and Maris, the *j in 1960.
Each enjoys seeing the other hit home runs ( I hope Roger hits 80, Mantle says ), and each enjoys even more seeing himself hit home runs ( and I hope I hit 81 ).
The sluggers get along so well in fact, that with their families at home for the summer ( Mantle's in Dallas, Maris's in Kansas City ), they are rooming together.
Mantle, Maris, and Bob Cerv, a utility outfielder, share an apartment in Jamaica, Long Island, not far from New York International Airport.
The three pay $251 a month for four rooms ( kitchen, dining room, living room, and bedroom ), with air-conditioning and new modern furniture.
Mantle and Cerv use the twin beds in the bedroom ; Maris sleeps on a green studio couch in the living room.
They divide up the household chores : Cerv does most of the cooking ( breakfast and sandwich snacks, with dinner out ), Mantle supplies the transportation ( a white 1961 Oldsmobile convertible ), and Maris drives the 25-minute course from the apartment house to Yankee Stadium.
Mantle, Maris, and Cerv probably share one major-league record already : among them, they have fifteen children -- eight for Cerv, four for Mantle, and three for Maris.
As roommates, teammates, and home-run mates, Mantle, 29, who broke in with the Yankees ten years ago, and Maris, 26, who came to the Yankees from Kansas City two years ago, have strikingly similar backgrounds.
Both were scholastic stars in football, basketball, and baseball ( Mantle in Commerce, Okla., Maris in Fargo, N.*d. ) ; as halfbacks, both came close to playing football at the University of Oklahoma ( sometimes in the minors, Maris recalls, I wished I had gone to Oklahoma ).
To an extent, the two even look alike.
Both have blue eyes and short blond hair.
Both are 6 feet tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pounds, but Mantle, incredibly muscular ( he has a 17-1/2-inch neck ), looks bigger.
With their huge backs and overdeveloped shoulders, both must have their clothes made to order.
Maris purchases $100 suits from Simpson's in New York.
Mantle, more concerned with dress, buys his suits four at a time at Neiman-*marcus in Dallas and pays as much as $250 each.
Light reading : neither Mantle nor Maris need fear being classified an intellectual, but lately Mantle has shown unusual devotion to an intellectual opus, Henry Miller's Tropic of Cancer.
Mantle so appreciated delicate Miller's literary style that he broadened teammates' minds by reading sensitive passages aloud during road trips.
Mantle is not normally given to public speaking -- or, for that matter, to private speaking.
What do you and Mickey talk about at home?
A reporter asked Maris recently.
To tell you the truth, Maris said, Mickey don't talk much.
This is no surprising trait for a ballplayer.
What is surprising and pleasant is that Mantle and Maris, under constant pressure from writers and photographers, are trying to be cooperative.
Of the two, Mantle is by nature the less outgoing, Maris the more outspoken.
But last week, when a reporter was standing near Mantle's locker, Mickey walked up and volunteered an anecdote.
See that kid?
He said, pointing to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy.
That's ( Yogi ) Berra's.
I'll never forget one time I struck out three times, dropped a fly ball, and we lost the game.
I came back, sitting by my locker, feeling real low, and the kid walks over to me, looks up, and says : you stunk.
Maris, in talking to reporters, tries to answer all questions candidly and fully, but on rare occasions, he shuns newsmen.
When I've made a dumb play, he says, I don't want to talk to anyone.
I'm angry.
By his own confession, Maris is an angry young man.
Benched at Tulsa in 1955, he told manager Dutch Meyer : I can't play for you.
Send me where I can play.
( Meyer sent him to Reading, Pa..
) benched at Indianapolis in 1956, he told manager Kerby Farrell : I'm not learning anything on the bench.
Play me.
( Farrell did -- and Maris led the team to victory in the Little World Series.
) that's the way I am, he says.
I tell people what I think.
If you're a good ballplayer, you've got to get mad.
Give me a team of nine angry men and I'll give you a team of nine gentlemen and we'll beat you nine out of ten times.
Idols' idols : one good indication of the two men's personalities is the way they reacted to meeting their own heroes.
Maris's was Ted Williams.
When I was a kid, Maris told a sportswriter last week, I used to follow Williams every day in the box score, just to see whether he got a hit or not.
When you came up to the majors, did you seek out Williams for advice?
Are you kidding?
Said Maris.
You're afraid to talk to a guy you idolize.
Mantle's hero was Joe Di*maggio.
When Mickey went to the Yankees, says Mark Freeman, an ex-*yankee pitcher who sells mutual funds in Denver, Di*maggio still was playing and every day Mickey would go by his locker, just aching for some word of encouragement from this great man, this hero of his.
But Di*maggio never said a word.
It crushed Mickey.
He told me he vowed right then that if he ever got to be a star, this never would be said of him.
Mantle has kept the vow.
Among all the Yankees, he is the veteran most friendly to rookies.
Neither Mantle nor Maris is totally devoted to baseball above all else.
If laying ties on a railroad track, which he once did for $1 an hour, paid more than playing right field for the Yankees, Maris would lay ties on a railroad track.
If working in a zinc mine, which he once did for 87-1/2 cents an hour, paid more than playing center field for the Yankees, Mantle would work in a zinc mine.
But since railroading and mining are not the highest paid arts, Mantle and Maris concentrate on baseball.
They try to play baseball the best they can.
Each is a complete ballplayer.
Mantle, beyond any question, can do more things well.
( one of the reasons they get along fine, says a sportswriter who is friendly with the two men, is that both realize Mantle is head-and-shoulders above Maris.
) hitting, Mantle has an immediate advantage because he bats both left-handed and right-handed, Maris only left-handed.
They both possess near classic stances, dug in firmly, arms high, set for fierce swings.
Mantle is considerably better hitting for average (.332
, fourth in the league, to.280
For Maris so far this year ).
Both are good bunters : Maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor leagues ; Mantle is a master at dragging a bunt toward first base.
Both have brilliant speed : Mantle was timed from home plate ( batting left-handed ) to first base in 3.1 seconds, faster than any other major leaguer ; Maris ran the 100-yard dash in ten seconds in high school and once won a race against Luis Aparicio, the swift, base-stealing shortstop of the White Sox.
Both are good, daring fielders : Mantle covers more ground ; Maris's throwing arm is stronger.
Yet with all their skills, the appeal of Mantle and Maris in 1961 comes down to one basic : the home run.
With this ultimate weapon, the two Yankees may have saved baseball from its dullest season.
( American League expansion created, inevitably, weaker teams.
Only two teams in each league ( the Yankees and Detroit, the Dodgers and Cincinnati ) are battling for first place.
Appropriately, the emphasis on the home run, at a peak this year, came into being at baseball's lowest moment.
In 1920, as the startling news that the 1919 White Sox had conspired to lose the World Series leaked out, fans grew disillusioned and disinterested in baseball.
Something was needed to revive interest ; the something was the home run.
Into Washington on President-elect John F. Kennedy's Convair, the Caroline, winged Actor-*crooner Frank Sinatra and his close Hollywood pal, Cinemactor Peter Lawford, Jack Kennedy's brother-in-law.
Also included in the entourage : a dog in a black sweater, Frankie and Peter had an urgent mission : to stage a mammoth Inauguration Eve entertainment gala in the capital's National Guard Armory.
Frankie was fairly glutted with ideas, as he had hinted upon his arrival : it's really tremendous when you think Ella Fitzgerald is coming from Australia.
I could talk to you for three hours and still not be able to give you all of our plans ] as the plans were laid, some several thousand fat cats were to be ensconced in the armory's $100 seats and in 68 ringside boxes priced at $10,000 each.
The biggest single act would doubtless be staged by Frankie himself : his Inaugural wardrobe had been designed by Hollywood Couturier Don Loper, who regularly makes up ladies' ensembles.
Soon after Loper leaked the news that Frankie had ordered two of everything just in case he spills anything, Frankie got so mad at the chic designer that he vowed he would not wear a stitch of Loper clothing.
A year after he was catapulted over nine officers senior to him and made commandant of the Marine Corps, General David M. Shoup delivered a peppery annual report in the form of a happy, warless New Year greeting to his Pentagon staff.
Said Leatherneck Shoup : a year ago I took the grips of the plow in my hands.
After pushing an accumulation of vines and weeds from the moldboard, I lifted the lines from the dust and found hitched to that plow the finest team I ever held a rein on.
Little geeing and hawing have been necessary.
But Shoup also gave the Corps a tilling in spots.
Speaking of pride, he deplored the noncommissioned officer whose uniform looks like it belonged to someone who retired in 1940 ; the officer with the yellow socks or the bay window.
A few of these people are still around.
Old and new briefly crossed paths in the U.*s. Senate, then went their respective ways.
At a reception for new members of Congress, Oregon Democrat Maurine Neuberger, taking the Senate seat held by her husband Richard until his death last March, got a brotherly buss from Democratic Elder Statesman Adlai Stevenson, U.*s. Ambassador-designate to the U.*n..
Meanwhile, after 24 years in the Senate, Rhode Island's durable Democrat Theodore Francis Greene -- having walked, swum and cerebrated himself to the hearty age of 93 -- left that august body ( voluntarily, because he could surely have been re-elected had he chosen to run again last November ), as the oldest man ever to serve in the Senate.
The most famous undergraduate of South Philadelphia High School is a current bobby-sox idol, Dreamboat Cacophonist Fabian ( real name : Fabian Forte ), 17, and last week it developed that he will remain an undergraduate for a while.
The principal of the school announced that -- despite the help of private tutors in Hollywood and Philadelphia -- Fabian is a 10-o'clock scholar in English and mathematics.
Lacking his needed credits in those subjects, Fabian will not graduate with his old classmates next week.
South Philadelphia High's principal added that the current delay was caused by the pressure of a movie that the toneless lad was making.
To Decathlon Man Rafer Johnson ( Time cover, Aug. 29 ), whose gold medal in last summer's Olympic Games was won as much on gumption as talent, went the A.*a.*u.'s James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy as the outstanding U.*s. amateur athlete of 1960.
As the world's top sportsman -- pro or amateur -- Sports Illustrated tapped golf's confident Arnold Palmer ( Time cover, May 2 ), who staged two cliffhanging rallies to win both the Masters and U.*s. Open crowns, went on to win a record $80,738 for the year.
Tooling through Sydney on his way to race in the New Zealand Grand Prix, Britain's balding Ace Driver Stirling Moss, 31, all but smothered himself in his own exhaust of self-crimination.
I'm a slob, he announced.
My taste is gaudy.
I'm useless for anything but racing cars.
I'm ruddy lazy, and I'm getting on in years.
It gets so frustrating, but then again I don't know what I could do if I gave up racing.
Has Moss no stirling virtues?
I appreciate beauty.
One of Nikita Khrushchev's most enthusiastic eulogizers, the U.*s.*s.*r.'s daily Izvestia, enterprisingly interviewed Red-prone Comedian Charlie Chaplin at his Swiss villa, where he has been in self-exile since 1952.
Chaplin, 71, who met K. when the Soviet boss visited England in 1956, confided that he hopes to visit Russia some time this summer because I have marveled at your grandiose experiment and I believe in your future.
Then Charlie spooned out some quick impressions of the Nikita he had glimpsed : I was captivated by his humor, frankness and good nature and by his kind, strong and somewhat sly face.
G. David Thompson is one of those names known to the stewards of transatlantic jetliners and to doormen in Europe's best hotels, but he is somewhat of an enigma to most people in his own home town of Pittsburgh.
There the name vaguely connotes new-rich wealth, a reputation for eccentricity, and an ardor for collecting art.
Last week, in the German city of Dusseldorf, G. David Thompson was making headlines that could well give Pittsburgh pause.
On display were 343 first-class paintings and sculptures from his fabled collection -- and every single one of them was up for sale.
Like Philadelphia's late Dr. Albert C. Barnes who kept his own great collection closed to the general public ( Time, Jan. 2 ), Thompson, at 61, is something of a legend in his own lifetime.
He made his fortune during World War 2 when he took over a number of dying steel plants and kept them alive until the boom.
Even before he hit big money, he had begun buying modern paintings.
He gave the impression of never having read a word about art, but there was no doubt that he had an eye for the best.
He was able to smell a bargain -- and a masterpiece -- a continent away, and the Museum of Modern Art's Alfred Barr said of him : I have never mentioned a new artist that Thompson didn't know about.
He might barge into a gallery, start haggling over prices without so much as a word of greeting.
He could be lavishly generous with friends, cab drivers and bellboys, but with dealers he was tough.
He bought up Cezannes, Braques, Matisses, Legers, a splendid Picasso series, more than 70 Giacometti sculptures.
He gathered one of the biggest collections of Paul Klees in the world.
All these he hung in his burglarproof home called Stone's Throw, outside Pittsburgh, and only people he liked and trusted ever got to see them.
Two years ago Thompson offered his collection to the city.
But he insisted that it be housed in a special museum.
Pittsburgh turned him down, just as Pittsburgh society had been snubbing him for years.
He went then to a 40-year-old Basel art dealer named Ernst Beyeler, with whom he had long been trading pictures.
Last year Beyeler arranged to sell $1,500,000 worth of Klees to the state of North Rhine-*westphalia, which will house them in a museum that is yet to be built.
Last week most of the other prizes, once offered to Pittsburgh, went on the block.
At the opening of the Dusseldorf show, Thompson himself scarcely glanced at the treasures that he was seeing together for the last time.
In fact he seemed delighted to get rid of them.
Some observers speculated that this might be his revenge on his home town.
Thompson himself said : I want to enjoy once more the pleasure of bare walls waiting for new pictures.
Break in Georgia the University of Georgia has long claimed that it does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race or color.
But in all its 175 years, not a single Negro student has entered its classrooms.
Last week Federal District Judge William A. Bootle ordered the university to admit immediately a qualified Negro boy and girl.
Their entry will crack the total segregation of all public education, from kindergarten through graduate school, in Georgia -- and in Alabama, Mississippi and South Carolina as well.
For 18 months, Hamilton Holmes, 19, and Charlayne Hunter, 18, had tried to get into the university.
They graduated together from Atlanta's Turner High School, where Valedictorian Holmes was first in the class and Charlayne third.
The university rejected them on a variety of pretexts, but was careful never to mention the color of their skins.
Holmes went to Atlanta's Morehouse ( Negro ) College, where he is a B student and star halfback.
Charlayne studied journalism at Detroit's Wayne State University.
Last fall, after they took their hopes for entering Georgia to court, Judge Bootle ordered them to apply again.
Charlayne was tentatively admitted for next fall, after state investigators questioned her white roommate at Wayne State.
But Holmes was rejected again on the basis of his record and interview.
The evidence in court was testimony about the interview, which for Holmes lasted an hour, although at least one white student at Georgia got through this ritual by a simple phone conversation.
Holmes was asked if he had ever visited a house of prostitution, or a beatnik parlor or teahouse.
No, said he, but officials still called him evasive.
They also said he lied in saying that he had never been arrested.
Their reason : Holmes once paid a $20 speeding fine, had his license suspended.
Negro lawyers dug into the records of 300 white students, found that many were hardly interviewed at all -- and few had academic records as good as Hamilton Holmes.
The real reason for his rejection, they argued, is the fact that Georgia law automatically cuts off funds for any desegregated school.
Judge Bootle's decision : the two plaintiffs are qualified for admission to said university and would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color.
The state will appeal -- but few think it will actually try to close the university.
Surprised and pleased, students Holmes and Hunter may enter the University of Georgia this week.
Catch for Chicago when the University of Chicago's Chancellor Lawrence A. Kimpton submitted his resignation last March, a mighty talent hunt gripped the Midway.
Out went letters to 60,000 old grads, asking for suggestions.
Such academic statesmen as James B. Conant were consulted.
Two committees pondered 375 possible Kimpton successors, including Adlai Stevenson, Richard Nixon, and Harvard's Dean Mc*george Bundy.
The debate led to a decision that Chicago needed neither a big name nor an experienced academic administrator, but rather, as Trustee Chairman Glen A. Lloyd put it, a top scholar in his own right -- a bright light to lure other top scholars to Chicago.
Last week Chicago happily found its top scholar in Caltech's acting dean of the faculty : dynamic Geneticist George Wells Beadle, 57, who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in medicine and physiology for discovering how genes affect heredity by controlling cell chemistry ( Time, Cover, July 14, 1958 ).
It fell to Chancellor Kimpton, now a Standard Oil ( Indiana ) executive, to spend his nine-year reign tidying up Chicago after the 21-year typhoon of Idealist Robert Maynard Hutchins.
He threw out some of Hutchins' more wildly experimental courses, raised sagging undergraduate enrollment to 2,100, nearly doubled endowment to $139.3 million.
But though Kimpton put Chicago in what he felt was working order, some old grads feel that it still needs the kind of lively teachers who filled it in the heady Hutchins era.
At Caltech, Geneticist Beadle has stuck close to his research as head of the school's famous biology division since 1946.
But he has shown a sixth-sense ability to spot, recruit and excite able researchers, and has developed unexpected talents in fund raising and speech-making.
Beadle is even that rare scientist who takes an interest in money matters ; he avidly reads the Wall Street Journal, and took delight in driving a $250 model *j Ford for 22 years, then selling it for $300.
A philosopher may point out that the troubles of the Congo began with the old Adam and consequently will never end.
But a historian might put his finger on a specific man and date, and hold out the hope that the troubles will sometime pass away.
The man was King Leopold 2 of the Belgians, who in 1885 concluded that he had better grab a colony while the grabbing was still good.
By force, he took under his protection, or stole, 900,000 square miles of wilderness in Central Africa.
This is an area nearly as large as Western Europe ; and it was filled then as now by quarreling tribes with no political or historical unity.
Its boundaries had nothing to do with geography or ethnic groupings ; they were determined by the points at which Leopold's explorers and gunmen got tired of walking.
The population of the Congo is 13.5 million, divided into at least seven major culture clusters and innumerable tribes speaking 400 separate dialects.
The religions of the people include Christianity, Mohammedanism, paganism, ancestor worship and animism.
The climate ranges from the steamily equatorial to the temperate.
The hospitals contain patients trampled by elephants or run over by sports cars.
To make one nation out of these disparities would be a problem large enough in any case ; it has been made far more difficult by what the Belgians have done, or failed to do, in the Congo since 1885.
At first the Belgian royal family administered the Congo as its own private property.
But by 1908 its record of brutality had touched the national conscience.
The Belgian government itself took over administration, commencing a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism.
One definition of paternalism is the principle or practice, on the part of a government, of managing the affairs of a country in the manner of a father dealing with his children.
The honor of the Belgians in this matter is not to be questioned -- only their judgment.
Ordinarily a father permits his children to grow up in due time -- but when the colony received independence in 1960 the Congolese child, if one imagines him to have been born in 1908, was 52 and had until then been treated as an infant.
The Belgians were interested primarily in the economic development of the Congo, which is rich in copper, tin, cobalt, manganese, zinc, and uranium, and cotton and palm oil.
The colony was administered from Brussels, with neither the Congolese nor the resident Belgians having any vote.
The beneficiaries of this administration were a number of huge cartels in which both individuals and the Belgian government itself held stock.
In Inside Africa, John Gunther describes one of these, the Societe Generale, as the kind of colossus that might be envisaged if, let us say, the House of Morgan, Anaconda Copper, the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, the Pennsylvania Railroad, and various companies producing agricultural products were lumped together, with the United States government as a heavy partner.
Had they been truly ruthless, the Belgians might have exploited the Congolese without compassion.
But they were not.
They provided a social security system which covered all their African employes ; their program of mass medical care was doubtless the best on the continent ; they put much effort into public housing.
They also instituted a ration system under which all employers in the Congo were required to furnish their employes with clothing and adequate food.
But instead of delivering the ration -- either in actual commodities or in cash -- at intervals of perhaps two weeks or a month, the Belgians felt obliged to dole it out more often.
Would not the children, if they received all their food on the first day of the month, eat it up immediately, and later go hungry?
The Belgians also placed great emphasis on education.
During the 1950s there were as many as 25,000 schools in the Congo.
But almost all the schools were primary.
The average Congolese can do little more than puzzle out the meaning of la chatte and le chien and write his name.
Some schools were technical -- the Belgians needed carpenters and mechanics to help exploit the land, and trained many.
But they did not believe in widespread secondary education, much less in college.
It was their conviction that the people should be brought up together, a grade at a time, until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history, economics and political science.
Indeed, the Belgians discouraged higher education, fearing the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest.
When the Congo received its independence in 1960 there were, among its 13.5 million people, exactly 14 university graduates.
Why did the Belgians grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it?
In one large oversimplification, it might be said that the Belgians felt, far too late, the gale of nationalism sweeping Africa.
They lacked time to prepare the Congo, as the British and French had prepared their colonies.
The Congolese were clamoring for their independence, even though most were unsure what it meant ; and in Brussels, street crowds shouted, pas une goutte de sang ] ( not one drop of blood ] ).
The Belgians would not fight for the privilege of being the detested pedagogue ; rather than teach where teaching was not wanted, they would wash their hands of the mess.
It is hard to blame them for this.
Yet there were other motivations and actions which the Belgians took after independence for which history may not find them guiltless.
As the time for independence approached there were in the Congo no fewer than 120 political parties, or approximately eight for each university graduate.
There were four principal ones.
First, there were those Congolese ( among them Joseph Kasavubu ) who favored splitting the country into small independent states, Balkanizing it.
Second, there were those ( Moise Tshombe ) who favored near-*balkanization, a loose federalism having a central government of limited authority, with much power residing in the states.
Third, there were those ( notably Patrice Lumumba ) who favored a unified Congo with a very strong central government.
And fourth, there were moderates who were in no hurry who were in no hurry for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew for independence and wished to wait until the Congo grew up.
However shifting.
, the positions of all parties and leaders were constantly shifting.
A a final factor which contributed greatly to the fragmentation of the Congo, immediately after independence, was the provincial structure the Belgians for convenience in administration that had been established by the Belgians for convenience in administration.
They had divided the Congo into six.
They had divided the Congo into six provinces -- Leopoldville, Kasai, Kivu, Katanga, Equator and Eastern -- unfortunately with with little regard for ethnic groupings.
Thus some provinces contained tribes which detested each other, and to them independence meant an opportunity for war.
The Belgian Congo was granted its independence with what seemed a workable Western-style form of government : there were to be a president and a premier, and a bicameral legislature elected by universal suffrage in the provinces.
Well-wishers around the world hoped that the Congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nations.
If internal frictions arose, they could be handled by the 25,000-man Congolese army, the Force still officered by Publique, which had been trained and was white Belgians.
The president, Joseph Kasavubu, seemed an able administrator and the premier, Patrice Lumumba, a reasonable man.
Twenty-four hours after independence the wild tribesmen commenced fighting each other.
Presently the well-armed members of the Force Publique many of them drawn from savage and even cannibalistic tribes, erupted in mutiny, rioting, raping and looting.
Terror engulfed the thousands of Belgian civilians who had remained in the country.
The Belgian government decided to act, and on July 10 dispatched paratroops to the Congo.
On July 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of Katanga, Moise Tshombe, announced that his province had seceded from the country.
Confusion became chaos ; each succeeding day brought new acts of violence.
Lumumba and Kasavubu blamed it all on the military intervention by the Belgians, and appealed to the United Nations to send troops to oust them.
On July 14 the Security Council -- with France and Great Britain abstaining -- voted the resolution which drew the U.*n. into the Congo.
Vague in wording, it called for withdrawal of Belgian troops and authorized the Secretary-*general to take the necessary steps to provide the ( Congolese ) Government with such military assistance as may be necessary, until, through the efforts of the Congolese Government with the technical assistance of the United Nations, the national security forces may be able, in the opinion of the Government, to meet fully their tasks.
Secretary-*general Hammarskjold decided that it would be preferable if the U.*n. troops sent into the Congo were to come from African, or at least nonwhite, nations -- certainly not from the U.*s., Russia, Great Britain or France.
He quickly called on Ghana, Tunisia, Morocco, Guinea and Mali, which dispatched troops within hours.
Ultimately the U.*n. army in the Congo reached a top strength of 19,000, including about 5,000 from India and a few soldiers from Eire and Sweden, who were the only whites.
It took the U.*n. three months to bring a modest form of order to the Congo.
The Belgians were reluctant to withdraw their troops and often obstructed U.*n. efforts.
The wildly erratic nature of Patrice Lumumba caused constant problems -- he frequently announced that he wanted the U.*n. to get out of the Congo along with the Belgians, and appealed to Russia for help.
( however, there is little evidence that the late Lumumba was a Communist.
Before appealing to the U.*n. or to Russia, he first appealed to the U.*s. for military help, and was rejected.
) Lumumba further complicated the U.*n.'s mission by initiating small wars with the secessionist province of Katanga and with South Kasai which, under Albert Kalonji, wanted to secede as well.
Meanwhile Russia took every opportunity to meddle in the Congo, sending Lumumba equipment for his wars, dispatching technicians and even threatening, on occasion, to intervene openly.
But by the end of the three-month period, in October 1960, something approaching calm settled on the Congo.
President Kasavubu became exasperated with Lumumba and fired him.
Lumumba fired Kasavubu.
Control of the government -- such control as there was and such government as there was -- passed into the hands of Joseph Mobutu, chief of staff of the Congolese army.
Mobutu promptly flung out the Russians, who have not since played any significant part on the local scene, although they have redoubled their obstructionist efforts at U.*n. headquarters in New York.
The Belgians -- at least officially -- departed from the Congo as well, withdrawing all of their uniformed troops.
But they left behind them large numbers of officers, variously called volunteers or mercenaries, who now staff the army of Moise Tshombe in Katanga, the seceded province which, according to Tshombe, holds 65% of the mineral wealth of the entire country.
From October 1960 to February 1961, the U.*n. forces in the Congo took little action.
There was no directive for it -- the Security Council's resolution had not mentioned political matters, and in any case the United Nations by the terms of its charter may not interfere in the political affairs of any nation, whether to unify it, federalize it or Balkanize it.
During the five-month lull, civil war smoldered and flickered throughout the Congo.
In February the murder of Patrice Lumumba, who had been kidnaped into Katanga and executed on order of Tshombe, again stirred the U.*n. to action.
On Feb. 21 the council passed another resolution urging the taking of all appropriate measures to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the Congo, including the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort.
Although the resolution might have been far more specific, it was considerably tougher than the earlier one.
It also urged that the U.*n. eject, and prevent the return of, all Belgian and other foreign military and political advisers ; ordered an investigation of Lumumba's death ; urged the reconvention of the Congolese Parliament and the reorganization of the army.
The presidency : talking and listening though President John F. Kennedy was primarily concerned with the crucial problems of Berlin and disarmament adviser Mc*cloy's unexpected report from Khrushchev, his new enthusiasm and reliance on personal diplomacy involved him in other key problems of U.*s. foreign policy last week.
High up on the President's priority list was the thorny question of Bizerte.
On this issue, the President received a detailed report from his U.*n. Ambassador Adlai Stevenson, who had just returned from Paris, and Mr. Kennedy asked Stevenson to search for a face-saving way -- for both Paris and Tunis -- out of the imbroglio.
Ideally, the President would like the French to agree on a status quo ante on Bizerte, and accept a new timetable for withdrawing their forces from the Mediterranean base.
To continue their important conversations about the Tunisian issue and the whole range of other problems, Mr. Kennedy invited Stevenson to Cape Cod for the weekend.
The President also discussed the Bizerte deadlock with the No. 2 man in the Tunisian Government, Defense Minister Bahi Ladgham, who flew to Washington last week to seek U.*s. support.
The conversation apparently convinced Mr. Kennedy that the positions of France and Tunisia were not irreconcilable.
Through Ladgham, Mr. Kennedy sent a message along those lines to Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba ; and one U.*s. official said : the key question now is which side picks up the phone first.
On the Latin American front, the President held talks with Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon before sending him to Uruguay and the Inter-*american Economic and Social Council ( which the President himself had originally hoped to attend ).
Main purpose of the meeting : to discuss President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress.
And that was not all.
In conferences with Nationalist China's dapper, diminutive Vice President Chen Cheng, Mr. Kennedy assured Chiang Kai-shek's emissary that the U.*s. is as firmly opposed as ever to the admission of Red China to the United Nations.
Chen was equally adamant in his opposition to the admission of Outer Mongolia ; however the President, who would like to woo the former Chinese province away from both Peking and Moscow, would promise Chen nothing more than an abstention by the U.*s. if Outer Mongolia's admission comes to a vote.
The President also conferred with emissaries from Guatemala and Nepal who are seeking more foreign aid.
To Africa, he sent his most trusted adviser, his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy, on a good-will mission to the Ivory Coast.
All week long the President clearly was playing a larger personal role in foreign affairs ; in effect, he was practicing what he preached in his Berlin message two weeks ago when he declared : we shall always be prepared to discuss international problems with any and all nations that are willing to talk, and listen, with reason.
Crime : skyjacked from International Airport in Los Angeles to International Airport in Houston, as the great four-jet Boeing 707 flies, is a routine five hours and 25 minutes, including stopovers at Phoenix, El Paso, and San Antonio.
When Continental Airlines night-coach Flight 54 took off at 11:30 one night last week, there was no reason to think it would take any longer.
The plane put down on schedule at 1:35 a.m. in Phoenix.
Thirty-one minutes later, when it took off for El Paso, hardly anyone of the crew of six or the 65 other passengers paid any attention to the man and teen-age boy who had come aboard.
At 3:57 a.m., with the plane about twenty minutes out of El Paso, passenger Robert Berry, a San Antonio advertising man, glanced up and saw the man and boy, accompanied by a stewardess, walking up the aisle toward the cockpit.
The man was bent over with his hand on his stomach, Berry said.
I figured he was sick.
John Salvador, a farmer from Palm Desert, Calif., was sitting up front and could see through the door as the trio entered the cockpit.
The kid had a.45
Automatic, like they issue in the Army, he said.
The other fellow had a.38
.
Salvador saw the youth hold his.45
Against the head of stewardess Lois Carnegey ; the man put his.38
At the head of Capt. Byron D. Rickards.
To Rickards, a 52-year-old veteran 30 years in the air, it was an old story : his plane was being hijacked in mid-flight again much as it had happened in 1930, when Peruvian rebels made him land a Ford tri-motor at Arequipa.
But last week's pirates, like the Cuban-*american who recently hijacked an Eastern Airlines Electra ( Newsweek, Aug. 7 ), wanted to go to Havana.
Stalling : tell your company there are four of us here with guns, the elder man told Rickards.
The pilot radioed El Paso International Airport with just that message.
But, he told the skyjackers, the 707 didn't carry enough fuel to reach Havana ; they would have to refuel at El Paso.
Most passengers didn't know what had happened until they got on the ground.
Jerry Mc*cauley of Sacramento, Calif., one of some twenty Air Force recruits on board, awoke from a nap in confusion.
The old man came from the front of the plane and said he wanted four volunteers to go to Cuba, Mc*cauley said, and like a nut I raised my hand.
I thought he was the Air Force recruiter.
What the man wanted was four persons to volunteer as hostages, along with the crew.
They chose four : Jack Casey, who works for Continental Airlines in Houston ; Fred Mullen from Mercer Island, Wash. ; Pfc. Truman Cleveland of St. Augustine.
Fla., and Leonard Gilman, a former college boxer and veteran of the U.*s. Immigration Service Border Patrol.
Everybody else was allowed to file off the plane after it touched down at El Paso at 4:18 a.m..
They found a large welcoming group -- El Paso policemen, Border Patrol, sheriff's deputies, and *j men, who surged around the plane with rifles and submachine guns.
Other *j men, talking with the pilot from the tower, conspired with him to delay the proposed flight to Havana.
The ground crew, which ordinarily fuels a 707 in twenty minutes, took fully three hours.
Still more time was consumed while the pilot, at the radioed suggestion of Continental president Robert Six, tried to persuade the armed pair to swap the Boeing jet for a propeller-driven Douglas *j.
Actually, the officers on the ground had no intention of letting the hijackers get away with any kind of an airplane ; they had orders to that effect straight from President Kennedy, who thought at first, as did most others, that it was four followers of Cuba's Fidel Castro who had taken over the 707.
Mr. Kennedy had been informed early in the day of the attempt to steal the plane, kept in touch throughout by telephone.
At one time, while still under the impression that he was dealing with a Cuban plot, the President talked about invoking a total embargo on trade with Cuba.
As the morning wore on and a blazing West Texas sun wiped the shadows off the Franklin Mountains, police got close enough to the plane to pry into the baggage compartment.
From the luggage, they learned that the two air pirates, far from being Cubans, were native Americans, subsequently identified as Leon Bearden, 50-year-old ex-convict from Coolidge, Ariz., and his son, Cody, 16, a high-school junior.
Tension the heat and strain began to tell on the Beardens.
The father, by accident or perhaps to show, as he said, we mean business, took the.45
And fired a slug between the legs of Second Officer Norman Simmons.
At 7:30 a.m., more than three hours after landing, the Beardens gave an ultimatum : take off or see the hostages killed.
The tower cleared the plane for take-off at 8 a.m., and Captain Rickards began taxiing toward the runway.
Several police cars, loaded with armed officers, raced alongside, blazing away at the tires of the big jet.
The slugs flattened ten tires and silenced one of the inboard engines ; the plane slowed to a halt.
Ambulances, baggage trucks, and cars surrounded it.
The day wore on.
At 12:50 p.m. a ramp was rolled up to the plane.
A few minutes later, *j agent Francis Crosby, talking fast, eased up the ramp to the plane, unarmed.
While Crosby distracted the Beardens, stewardesses Carnegey and Toni Besset dropped out of a rear door.
So did hostages Casey, Cleveland, and Mullen.
That left only the four crew members, Crosby, and Border Patrolman Gilman, all unarmed, with the Beardens.
The elder Bearden had one pistol in his hand, the other in a hip pocket.
Gilman started talking to him until he saw his chance.
He caught officer Simmons' eye, nodded toward young Bearden, and -- I swung my right as hard as I could.
Simmons and Crosby jumped the boy and it was all over.
Frog-marched off the airplane at 1:48 p.m., the Beardens were held in bail of $100,000 each on charges of kidnapping and transporting a stolen plane across state lines.
( Bearden reportedly hoped to peddle the plane to Castro, and live high in Cuba.
) back home in Coolidge, Ariz., his 36-year-old wife, Mary, said : I thought they were going to Phoenix to look for jobs.
Congress : more muscle taking precedence over all other legislation on Capitol Hill last week was the military strength of the nation.
The Senate put other business aside as it moved with unaccustomed speed and unanimity to pass -- 85 to 0 -- the largest peacetime defense budget in U.*s. history.
With the money all but in hand, however, the Administration indicated that, instead of the 225,000 more men in uniform that President Kennedy had requested, the armed forces would be increased by only 160,000.
The hold-back, as Pentagon mutterers labeled it, apparently was a temporary expedient intended to insure that the army services are built up gradually and, thus, the new funds spent prudently.
In all, the Senate signed a check for $46.7 billion, which not only included the extra $3.5 billion requested the week before by President Kennedy, but tacked on $754 million more than the President had asked for.
( the Senate, on its own, decided to provide additional *j and other long-range bombers for the Strategic Air Command.
) The House, which had passed its smaller appropriation before the President's urgent call for more, was expected to go along with the increased defense budget in short order.
In other areas, Congressional action last week included : the Senate ( by voice vote ) and the House ( by 224-170 ) passed and sent to the White House the compromise farm bill which the President is expected to sign, not too unhappily.
The Senate also voted $5.2 billion to finance the government's health, welfare, and labor activities.
Debate on the all-important foreign-aid bill, with its controversial long-range proposals, had just begun on the Senate floor at the weekend.
White House legislative aides were still confident the bill would pass intact.
Food : stew a la Mulligatawny most members of the U.*s. Senate, because they are human, like to eat as high on the hog as they can.
But, because they are politicians, they like to talk as poor-mouth as the lowliest voter.
As a result, ever since 1851 when the Senate restaurant opened in the new wing of the Capitol Building, the senators have never ceased to grumble about the food -- even while they opposed every move that might improve it.
Over the years, enlivened chiefly by disputes about the relative merits of Maine and Idaho potatoes, the menu has pursued its drab all-*american course.
Individual senators, with an eye to the voters back home, occasionally introduced smelts from Michigan, soft-shell crabs from Maryland, oysters from Washington, grapefruit from Florida.
But plain old bean soup, served daily since the turn of the century ( at the insistence of the late Sen. Fred Dubois of Idaho ), made clear to the citizenry that the Senate's stomach was in the right place.
In a daring stroke, the Senate ventured forth last week into the world of haute cuisine and hired a $10,000-per-year French-born maitre d'hotel.
Holders of toll-road bonds are finding improvements in monthly reports on operation of the turnpikes.
Long-term trend of traffic on these roads seems clearly upward.
Higher toll rates also are helping boost revenues.
Result is a better prospect for a full payoff by bonds that once were regarded as highly speculative.
Things are looking up these days for many of the State turnpikes on which investors depend for income from their toll-road bonds.
Traffic on nearly all the turnpikes has been growing.
That added traffic means rising streams of dimes and quarters at toll gates.
As a result of the new outlook for turnpikes, investors who bought toll-road bonds when these securities ranked as outright speculations are now finding new hope for their investments.
Another result is that buyers are tending to bid up the prices of these tax-exempt bonds.
Other tax-exempt bonds of State and local governments hit a price peak on February 21, according to Standard & Poor's average.
On balance, prices of those bonds have slipped a bit since then.
However, in the same three-month period, toll-road bonds, as a group, have bucked this trend.
On these bonds, price rises since February 21 easily outnumber price declines.
Tax-free returns.
Investors, however, still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bonds.
You find the evidence of that in the chart on this page.
Many of the toll-road bonds still are selling at prices that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent, or very close to that.
And this is true in the case of some turnpikes on which revenues have risen close to, or beyond, the point at which the roads start to pay all operating costs plus annual interest on the bonds.
That 4 per cent yield is well below the return to be had on good corporation bonds.
It's not much more, in fact, than the return that is offered on U. S. Treasury bonds.
For investors whose income is taxed at high rates, though, a tax-free yield of 4 per cent is high.
It is the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $16,000 of income to be taxed, or for a married couple with more than $32,000 of taxed income.
Swelling traffic.
A new report on the earnings records of toll roads in the most recent 12-month period -- ending in February or March -- shows what is happening.
The report is based on a survey by Blyth & Company, investment bankers.
Nearly all the turnpikes show gains in net revenues during the period.
And there is the bright note : the gains were achieved in the face of temporary traffic lags late in 1960 and early in 1961 as a result of business recession.
Many of the roads also were hit by an unusually severe winter.
Indication : the long-term trend of turnpike traffic is upward.
Look, for example, at the Ohio Turnpike.
Traffic on that road slumped sharply in January and February, as compared with those same months in 1960.
Then March brought an 18 per cent rise in net revenues -- after operating costs.
As a result, the road's net revenues in the 12 months ending March 31 were 186 per cent of the annual interest payments on the turnpike bonds.
That was up from 173 per cent in the preceding 12 months.
That same pattern of earnings shows up on the Massachusetts Turnpike.
Operating revenues were off in the first three months of 1961, but up for the 12 months ending in March.
Costs were held down, despite a bitter winter.
For the year, the road earned 133 per cent of its interest costs, against 121 per cent in the preceding period.
The road's engineers look for further improvement when the turnpike is extended into Boston.
Slow successes.
Some turnpikes have not been in full operation long enough to prove what they can do.
The 187-mile Illinois State Toll Highway, for example, was not opened over its entire length until December, 1958.
In the 12 months ended in February, 1960, the highway earned enough to cover 64 per cent of its interest load -- with the remainder paid out of initial reserves.
In the 12 months ended in February, 1961, this highway earned 93 per cent of its interest.
That improvement is continuing.
In the first two months of 1961, earnings of the Illinois highway available for interest payments were up 55 per cent from early 1960.
Success, for many turnpikes, has come hard.
Traffic frequently has failed to measure up to engineers' rosy estimates.
In these cases, the turnpike managements have had to turn to toll-rate increases, or to costly improvements such as extensions or better connections with other highways.
Many rate increases already have been put into effect.
Higher tolls are planned for July 1, 1961, on the Richmond-*petersburg, Va., Turnpike, and proposals for increased tolls on the Texas Turnpike are under study.
Easier access.
Progress is being made, too, in improving motorists' access to many turnpikes.
The Kansas Turnpike offers an illustration.
Net earnings of that road rose from 62 per cent of interest requirements in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 months ended Feb. 28, 1961.
Further improvements in earnings of the Kansas Turnpike are expected late in 1961, with the opening of a new bypass at Wichita, and still later when the turnpike gets downtown connections in both Kansas City, Kans., and Kansas City, Mo..
Meanwhile, there appears to be enough money in the road's reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more years.
For some roads, troubles.
Investors studying the toll-road bonds for opportunities find that not all roads are nearing their goals.
Traffic and revenues on the Chicago Skyway have been a great disappointment to planners and investors alike.
If nothing is done, the prospect is that that road will be in default of interest in 1962.
West Virginia toll bonds have defaulted in interest for months, and, despite recent improvement in revenues, holders of the bonds are faced with more of the same.
These, however, are exceptions.
The typical picture at this time is one of steady improvement.
It's going to take time for investors to learn how many of the toll-road bonds will pay out in full.
Already, however, several of the turnpikes are earning enough to cover interest requirements by comfortable margins.
Many others are attracting the traffic needed to push revenues up to the break-even point.
A top American official, after a look at Europe's factories, thinks the U.*s. is in a very serious situation competitively.
Commerce Secretary Luther Hodges, accompanied by a member of our staff, on May 10 toured plants of two of Italy's biggest companies -- Fiat, the auto producer, and Olivetti, maker of typewriters and calculating machines.
Our staff man cabled from Turin as follows -- follow Secretary Hodges through the Fiat plant, and you learn this : one, modern equipment -- much of it supplied under the Marshall Plan -- enables Fiat to turn out 2,100 cars a day.
About half of these are exported.
Two, wage costs are a fraction of the U.*s. costs.
A skilled worker on the assembly line, for example, earns $37 a week.
Three, labor troubles are infrequent.
Fiat officials say they have had no strikes for more than six years.
Said Secretary Hodges : it's a tough combination for the U.*s. to face.
Olivetti had a special interest for Hodges.
Olivetti took over Underwood, the U.*s. typewriter maker, in late 1959.
Within a year, without reducing wages, Underwood's production costs were cut one third, prices were slashed.
The result has been that exports of Underwood products have doubled.
The Olivetti plant near Turin has modern layout, modern machinery.
The firm is design-conscious, sales-conscious, advertising-conscious.
Hodges is trying to get more foreign business to go to the U.*s..
The inflow of foreign capital would help the U.*s. balance of payments.
Hodges predicted : I think we will see more foreign firms coming to the U.*s..
There are many places where we can use their vigor and new ideas.
Foreign competition has become so severe in certain textiles that Washington is exploring new ways of handling competitive imports.
The recently unveiled Kennedy moves to control the international textile market can be significant for American businessmen in many lines.
Important aspects of the Kennedy textile plans are these : an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting countries will be called shortly by President Kennedy.
Chief aims of the proposed conference are worth noting.
The U.*s. will try to get agreement among the industrialized countries to take more textile imports from the less-developed countries over the years.
Point is that developing countries often build up a textile industry first, need encouragement to get on their feet.
If they have trouble exporting, international bill for their support will grow larger than it otherwise would.
Idea is to let these countries earn their way as much as possible.
At the same time, another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage countries to control textile exports -- especially dumping of specific products -- to high-wage textile-producing countries.
Japan, since 1957, has been voluntarily curbing exports of textiles to the U.*s..
Hong Kong, India and Pakistan have been limiting exports of certain types of textiles to Britain for several years under the Lancashire Pact.
None of these countries is happy with these arrangements.
The Japanese want to increase exports to the U.*s. while they have been curbing shipments, they have watched Hong Kong step in and capture an expanding share of the big U.*s. market.
Hong Kong interests loudly protest limiting their exports to Britain, while Spanish and Portuguese textiles pour into British market unrestrictedly.
The Indians and Pakistanis are chafing under similar restrictions on the British market for similar reasons.
The Kennedy hope is that, at the conference or through bilateral talks, the low-wage textile-producing countries in Asia and Europe will see that dumping practices cause friction all around and may result in import quotas.
Gradual, controlled expansion of the world's textile trade is what President Kennedy wants.
This may point the way toward international stabilization agreements in other products.
It's an important clue to Washington thinking.
Note, too, that the Kennedy textile plan looks toward modernization or shrinkage of the U.*s. textile industry.
Get competitive or get out.
In veiled terms, that's what the Kennedy Administration is saying to the American textile industry.
The Government will help in transferring companies and workers into new lines, where modernization doesn't seem feasible.
Special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allowed.
Government research will look into new products and methods.
Import quotas aren't ruled out where the national interest is involved.
But the Kennedy Administration doesn't favor import quotas.
Rather, they are impressed with the British Government's success in forcing -- and helping -- the British textile industry to shrink and to change over to other products.
What's happening in textiles can be handwriting on the wall for other lines having difficulty competing with imports from low-wage countries.
Among the highest-paid workers in the world are U.*s. coal miners.
Yet U.*s. coal is cheap enough to make foreign steelmakers' mouths water.
Steel Company of Wales, a British steelmaker, wants to bring in Virginia coal, cut down on its takings of Welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively -- especially in foreign markets.
Virginia coal, delivered by ship in Wales, will be about $2.80 a ton cheaper than Welsh coal delivered by rail from nearby mines.
U.*s. coal is cheap, despite high wages, because of widespread mechanization of mines, wide coal seams, attactive rates on ocean freight.
Many of the coal seams in the nationalized British mines are twisting, narrow and very deep.
Productivity of U.*s. miners is twice that of the British.
Welsh coal miners, Communist-led, are up in arms at the suggestion that the steel company bring in American coal.
They threaten to strike.
The British Government will have to decide whether to let U.*s. coal in.
The British coal industry is unprofitable, has large coal stocks it can't sell.
Every library borrower, or at least those whose taste goes beyond the five-cent fiction rentals, knows what it is to hear the librarian say apologetically, I'm sorry, but we don't have that book.
There wouldn't be much demand for it, I'm afraid.
Behind this reply, and its many variations, is the ever-present budget problem all libraries must face, from the largest to the smallest.
What to buy out of the year's grist of nearly 15,000 book titles?
What to buy for adult and child readers, for lovers of fiction and nonfiction, for a clientele whose wants are incredibly diversified, when your budget is pitifully small?
Most library budgets are hopelessly inadequate.
A startlingly high percentage do not exceed $500 annually, which includes the librarian's salary, and not even the New York Public has enough money to meet its needs -- this in the world's richest city.
The plight of a small community library is proportionately worse.
Confronted with this situation, most libraries either endure the severe limitations of their budgets and do what they can with what they have, or else depend on the bounty of patrons and local governments to supplement their annual funds.
In some parts of the country, however, a co-operative movement has begun to grow, under the wing of state governments, whereby, with the financial help of the state, libraries share their book resources on a county-wide or regional basis.
New York State has what is probably the most advanced of these co-operative systems, so well developed that it has become a model for others to follow.
Because it is so large a state, with marked contrasts in population density, the organization of the New York co-operative offers a cross-section of how the plan works.
At one extreme are the systems of upper New York State, where libraries in two or more counties combine to serve a large, sparsely populated area.
At the other are organizations like the newly formed Nassau Library System, in a high-density area, with ample resources and a rapidly growing territory to serve.
Both these types, and those in between, are in existence by reason of a legislative interest in libraries that began at Albany as early as 1950, with the creation by the legislature of county library systems financed by county governments with matching funds from the state.
It was a step in the right direction, but it took an additional act passed in 1958 to establish fully the thriving systems of today.
Under this law annual grants are given to systems in substantial amounts.
An earlier difficulty was overcome by making it clear that individual libraries in any area might join or not, as they saw fit.
Some library boards are wary of the plan.
A large, well-stocked library, surrounded in a county by smaller ones, may feel that the demands on its resources are likely to be too great.
A small library may cherish its independence and established ways, and resist joining in a cooperative movement that sometimes seems radical to older members of the board.
Within a system, however, the autonomy of each member library is preserved.
The local community maintains responsibility for the financial support of its own library program, facilities, and services, but wider resources and additional services become available through membership in a system.
All services are given without cost to members.
So obvious are these advantages that nearly 95 per cent of the population of New York State now has access to a system, and enthusiastic librarians foresee the day, not too distant, when all the libraries in the state will belong to a co-op.
To set up a co-operative library system, the law requires a central book collection of 100,000 nonfiction volumes as the nucleus, and the system is organized around it.
The collection may be in an existing library, or it may be built up in a central collection.
Each system develops differently, according to the area it serves, but the universal goal is to pool the resources of a given area for maximum efficiency.
The basic state grant is thirty cents for each person served, and there is a further book incentive grant that provides an extra twenty cents up to fifty cents per capita, if a library spends a certain number of dollars.
In Nassau County, for example, the heavily settled Long Island suburb of New York City, the system is credited by the state with serving one million persons, a figure that has doubled since 1950.
This system, by virtue of its variety and size, offers an inclusive view of the plan in operation.
The Nassau system recognizes that its major task it to broaden reference service, what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge, and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area.
The need is for reference works of a more specialized nature than individual libraries, adequate to satisfy everyday needs, could afford.
Nassau is currently building a central collection of reference materials in its Hempstead headquarters, which will reach its goal of 100,000 volumes by 1965.
The major part of this collection is in the central headquarters building, and the remainder is divided among five libraries in the system designated as subject centers.
Basic reference tools are the backbone of the collection, but there is also specialization in science and technology, an indicated weakness in local libraries.
On microfilm, headquarters also has a file of the New York Times from its founding in 1851 to the present day, as well as bound volumes of important periodicals.
The entire headquarters collection is available to the patrons of all members on interlibrary loans.
Headquarters gets about 100 requests every day.
It is connected by teletype with the State Library in Albany, which will supply any book to a system that the system itself cannot provide.
The books are carried around by truck in canvas bags from headquarters to the other libraries.
Each subject center library was chosen because of its demonstrated strength in a particular area, which headquarters could then build upon.
East Meadow has philosophy, psychology, and religion ; Freeport houses social science, pure science, and language ; history, biography, and education are centered in Hempstead ; Levittown has applied science, business, and literature ; while Hewlett-*woodmere is the repository of art, music, and foreign languages.
The reference coordinator at headquarters also serves as a consultant, and is available to work with the local librarian in helping to strengthen local reference service.
This kind of cooperation is not wholly new, of course.
Public libraries in Nassau County have been lending books to each other by mail for a quarter-century, but the system enables this process to operate on an organized and far more comprehensive basis.
Local libraries find, too, that the new plan saves tax dollars because books can be bought through the system, and since the system buys in bulk it is able to obtain larger discounts than would be available to an individual library.
The system passes on these savings to its members.
Further money is saved through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail as the result of central billing.
Books are not the only resource of the system.
Schools and community groups turn to the headquarters film library for documentary, art, and experimental films to show at libraries that sponsor local programs, and to organizations in member communities.
The most recent film catalogue, available at each library, lists 110 titles presently in the collection, any of which may be borrowed without charge.
This catalogue lists separately films suitable for children, young adults, or adults, although some classics cut across age groups, such as Nanook Of The North, The Emperor's Nightingale, and The Red Balloon.
Workshops are conducted by the system's audio-visual consultant for the staffs of member libraries, teaching them the effective use of film as a library service.
The system well understands that one of its primary responsibilities is to bring children and books together ; consequently an experienced children's librarian at headquarters conducts a guidance program designed to promote well-planned library activities, cooperating with the children's librarians in member libraries by means of individual conferences, workshops, and frequent visits.
Headquarters has also set up a central juvenile book-review and book-selection center, to provide better methods of purchasing and selection.
Sample copies of new books are on display at headquarters, where librarians may evaluate them by themselves or in workshop groups.
Story hours, pre-school programs, activities with community agencies, and lists of recommended reading are all in the province of the children's consultant.
Headquarters of the Nassau system is an increasingly busy place these days, threatening to expand beyond its boundaries.
In addition to the interlibrary loan service and the children's program, headquarters has a public relations director who seeks to get wider grassroots support for quality library service in the county ; it prepares cooperative displays ( posters, booklists, brochures, and other promotional material ) for use in member libraries ; it maintains a central exhibit collection to share displays already created and used ; and it publishes Sum And Substance, a monthly newsletter, which reports the system's activities to the staffs and trustees of member libraries.
The system itself is governed by a board of trustees, geographically representing its membership.
In Nassau, as in other systems, the long-range objective is to bring the maximum service of libraries to bear on the schools, and on adult education in general.
Librarians, a patient breed of men and women who have borne much with dedication, can begin to see results today.
Library use is multiplying daily, and the bulk of the newcomers are those maligned Americans, the teen-agers.
To them especially the librarians, with the help of co-ops, hope they will never have to say, I'm sorry, we don't have that book.
Today, more than ever before, the survival of our free society depends upon the citizen who is both informed and concerned.
The great advances made in recent years in Communist strength and in our own capacity to destroy require an educated citizenry in the Western world.
The need for lifetime reading is apparent.
Education must not be limited to our youth but must be a continuing process through our entire lives, for it is only through knowledge that we, as a nation, can cope with the dangers that threaten our society.
The desire and ability to read are important aspects of our cultural life.
We cannot consider ourselves educated if we do not read ; if we are not discriminating in our reading ; if we do not know how to use what we do read.
We must not permit our society to become a slave to the scientific age, as might well happen without the cultural and spiritual restraint that comes from the development of the human mind through wisdom absorbed from the written word.
A fundamental source of knowledge in the world today is the book found in our libraries.
Although progress has been made in America's system of libraries it still falls short of what is required if we are to maintain the standards that are needed for an informed America.
The problem grows in intensity each year as man's knowledge, and his capacity to translate such knowledge to the written word, continue to expand.
The inadequacy of our library system will become critical unless we act vigorously to correct this condition.
There are, for example, approximately 25,000,000 people in this country with no public library service and about 50,000,000 with inadequate service.
In college libraries, 57 per cent of the total number of books are owned by 124 of 1,509 institutions surveyed last year by the U.*s. Office of Education.
And over 66 per cent of the elementary schools with 150 or more pupils do not have any library at all.
In every aspect of service -- to the public, to children in schools, to colleges and universities -- the library of today is failing to render vitally needed services.
Only public understanding and support can provide that service.
This is one of the main reasons for National Library Week, April 16-22, and for its theme : for a richer, fuller life, read ] assembly session brought much good the General Assembly, which adjourns today, has performed in an atmosphere of crisis and struggle from the day it convened.
It was faced immediately with a showdown on the schools, an issue which was met squarely in conjunction with the governor with a decision not to risk abandoning public education.
There followed the historic appropriations and budget fight, in which the General Assembly decided to tackle executive powers.
The final decision went to the executive but a way has been opened for strengthening budgeting procedures and to provide legislators information they need.
Long-range planning of programs and ways to finance them have become musts if the state in the next few years is to avoid crisis-to-crisis government.
This session, for instance, may have insured a financial crisis two years from now.
In all the turmoil, some good legislation was passed.
Some other good bills were lost in the shuffle and await future action.
Certainly all can applaud passage of an auto title law, the school bills, the increase in teacher pensions, the ban on drag racing, acceptance by the state of responsibility for maintenance of state roads in municipalities at the same rate as outside city limits, repeal of the college age limit law and the road maintenance bond issue.
No action has been taken, however, on such major problems as ending the fee system, penal reform, modification of the county unit system and in outright banning of fireworks sales.
Only a token start was made in attacking the tax reappraisal question and its companion issue of attracting industry to the state.
The legislature expended most of its time on the schools and appropriations questions.
Fortunately it spared us from the usual spate of silly resolutions which in the past have made Georgia look like anything but the empire state of the South.
We congratulate the entire membership on its record of good legislation.
In the interim between now and next year, we trust the House and Senate will put their minds to studying Georgia's very real economic, fiscal and social problems and come up with answers without all the political heroics.
League regularly stands on the side of right the League of Women Voters, 40 now and admitting it proudly, is inviting financial contributions in the windup of its fund drive.
It's a good use of money.
These women whose organization grew out of the old suffrage movement are dedicated to Thomas Jefferson's dictum that one must cherish the people's spirit but keep alive their attention.
If once they become inattentive to the public affairs, Jefferson said, you and I, and Congress and assemblies, judges and governors, shall all become wolves.
Newspapermen and politicians especially are aware of the penetrating attention and expert analysis the league gives to public affairs.
The league workers search out the pros and cons of the most complex issues and make them available to the public.
The harder the choice, the more willing the league is to wade in.
And the league takes a stand, with great regularity, on the side of right.
Look to Coosa Valley for industrial progress cities and counties interested in industrial development would do well in the months ahead to keep their eyes peeled toward the 13 northwest Georgia counties that are members of the Coosa Valley Area Planning and Development Commission.
Coupling its own budget of $83,750 with a $30,000 state grant authorized by Gov. Vandiver, the group expects to sign a contract in March with Georgia Tech..
Then a full-time planning office will be established in Rome to work with a five-member Georgia Tech research staff for development of an area planning and industrial development program.
The undertaking has abundant promise.
It recognizes the fact that what helps one county helps its neighbors and that by banding together in an area-wide effort better results can be accomplished than through the go-it-alone approach.
Rusk idea strengthens United States defense the Rusk belief in balanced defense, replacing the Dulles theory of massive retaliation, removes a grave danger that has existed.
The danger lay not in believing that our own *j would deter Russia's use of hers ; that theory was and is sound.
The danger lay in the American delusion that nuclear deterrence was enough.
By limiting American strength too much to nuclear strength, this country limited its ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war.
This strategy heightened the possibility that we would have a nuclear war.
It also weakened our diplomatic stance, because Russia could easily guess we did not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity.
This left the Soviets plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggressions with considerable impunity.
By maintaining the nuclear deterrent, but gearing American military forces to fight conventional wars too, Secretary of State Rusk junks bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and builds more muscle and greater safety into our military position.
De*kalb budget shows county is on beam De*kalb's budget for 1961 is a record one and carries with it the promise of no tax increase to make it balance.
It includes a raise in the county minimum wage, creation of several new jobs at the executive level, financing of beefed-up industrial development efforts, and increased expenditures for essential services such as health and welfare, fire protection, sanitation and road maintenance.
That such expansion can be obtained without a raise in taxes is due to growth of the tax digest and sound fiscal planning on the part of the board of commissioners, headed by Chairman Charles O. Emmerich who is demonstrating that the public trust he was given was well placed, and other county officials.
Somewhere, somebody is bound to love us G. Mennen Williams is learning the difficulties of diplomacy rapidly.
Touring Africa, the new U.*s. Assistant Secretary of State observed Africa should be for the Africans and the British promptly denounced him.
Then he arrived in Zanzibar and found Africans carrying signs saying American imperialists, go home.
Chin up, Soapy.
Power company backs confidence with dollars confidence in the state's economic future is reflected in the Georgia Power Company's record construction budget for this year.
The firm does a large amount of research and its forecasts have meaning.
It is good to know that Georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demands of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization.
Georgia's mental health program received a badly needed boost from the General Assembly in the form of a $1,750,000 budget increase for the Milledgeville State Hospital.
Actually it amounts to $1,250,000 above what the institution already is receiving, considering the additional half-million dollars Gov. Vandiver allocated last year from the state surplus.
Either way it sounds like a sizable hunk of money and is.
But exactly how far it will go toward improving conditions is another question because there is so much that needs doing.
The practice of charging employes for meals whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolished.
The work week of attendants who are on duty 65 hours and more per week should be reduced.
More attendants, nurses and doctors should be hired.
Patients deserve more attention than they are getting.
Even with the increase in funds for the next fiscal year, Georgia will be spending only around $3.15 per day per patient.
The national average is more than $4 and that figure is considered by experts in the mental health field to be too low.
Kansas, regarded as tops in the nation in its treatment of the mentally ill, spends $9 per day per patient.
Georgia has made some reforms, true.
The intensive treatment program is working well.
But in so many other areas we still are dragging.
Considering what is being done compared to what needs to be done, it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful planning toward making the best possible use of the increase granted.
The boost is helpful but inadequate.
The end of Trujillo assassination, even of a tyrant, is repulsive to men of good conscience.
Rafael Trujillo, the often blood-thirsty dictator of the Dominican Republic for 31 years, perhaps deserved his fate in an even-handed appraisal of history.
But whether the murder of El Benefactor in Ciudad Trujillo means freedom for the people of the Caribbean fiefdom is a question that cannot now be answered.
Trujillo knew a great deal about assassination.
The responsibility for scores of deaths, including the abduction and murder of Jesus Maria Galindez, a professor at Columbia University in New York, has been laid at his door.
He had been involved in countless schemes to do away with democratic leaders in neighboring countries such as President Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela.
It was a sort of poetic justice that at the time of his own demise a new plot to overthrow the Venezuelan government, reportedly involving the use of Dominican arms by former Venezuelan Dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez, has been uncovered and quashed.
The recent history of the Dominican Republic is an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tends to become oppressive.
Unquestionably Trujillo did some good things for his country : he improved public facilities such as roads and sanitation, attracted industry and investment and raised the standard of living notably.
But the price was the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition.
El Benefactor's vanity grew with his personal wealth.
The jails were filled to overflowing with political prisoners who had incurred his displeasure.
He maintained amply financed lobbies in the United States and elsewhere which sycophantically chanted his praise, and his influence extended even to Congress.
Until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the United States had been an article of faith with Trujillo, and altogether too often this profession was accepted here as evidence of his good character.
Tardily the Government here came to understand how this country's own reputation was tarnished by the association with repression.
Last year, after Trujillo had been cited for numerous aggressions in the Caribbean, the United States and many other members of the Organization of American States broke diplomatic relations with him.
Thereupon followed a demonstration that tyranny knows no ideological confines.
Trujillo's dictatorship had been along conservative, right-wing lines.
But after the censure he and his propaganda started mouthing Communist slogans.
There was considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with Castro in Cuba, previously a bete noire to Trujillo -- thus illustrating the way in which totalitarianism of the right and left coalesces.
What comes after Trujillo is now the puzzle.
The Dominican people have known no democratic institutions and precious little freedom for a generation, and all alternative leadership has been suppressed.
Perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability, but the vacuum of free institutions creates a great danger.
The Dominican Republic could turn toward Communist-type authoritarianism as easily as toward Western freedom.
Such a twist would be a tragedy for the Dominican people, who deserve to breathe without fear.
For that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the Dominican Republic will need the greatest sympathy and help.
Start on rapid transit high-speed buses on the George Washington Memorial Parkway, operating between downtown Washington and Cabin John, Glen Echo and Brookmont, would constitute an alluring sample of what the new National Capital Transportation Agency can do for this city.
In presenting plans for such express buses before the Montgomery County Council, the administrator of the *j, C. Darwin Stolzenbach, was frankly seeking support for the projects his agency will soon be launching.
Such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plans to be presented by the *j are as attractive as this outline of express buses coming into the downtown area.
Because the buses would not stop on the parkway, land for bus stations and for parking areas nearby will be needed.
The *j is well advised to seek funds for this purpose from the present session of Congress.
Must Berlin remain divided?
The inference has been too widely accepted that because the Communists have succeeded in building barricades across Berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that living city.
So far as the record is concerned, the Western powers have not acquiesced and should not do so.
Though Walter Ulbricht, by grace of Soviet tanks, may be head man in East Germany, that does not give him any right to usurp the government of East Berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the Soviet zone.
The wartime protocol of September 12, 1944, designated a special Greater Berlin area, comprising the entire city, to be under joint occupation.
It was not a part of any one of the three ( later four ) zones for occupation by Soviet, American, British, and French troops respectively.
After the Berlin blockade and airlift, the Council of Foreign Ministers in 1949 declared a purpose to mitigate the effects of the present administrative division of Germany and of Berlin.
For some time the Communists honored the distinction between the Soviet zone of Germany and the Soviet sector of Berlin by promulgating separately the laws for the two areas.
Then they moved offices of the East German puppet government into East Berlin and began illegally to treat it as the capital of East Germany.
That this and the closing of the East Berlin-*west Berlin border have not been accepted by the Western governments appears in notes which Britain, France, and the United States sent to Moscow after the latter's gratuitous protest over a visit of Chancellor Adenauer and other West German officials to West Berlin.
The Chancellor had as much business there as Ulbricht had in East Berlin -- and was certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunts of Gerhard Eisler.
The British and other replies to that Moscow note pointed out efforts of the Communist authorities to integrate East Berlin into East Germany by isolating it from the outside and attempting to make it the capital of East Germany.
They insisted on the fundamental fact that the whole of Berlin has a quadripartite status.
This is far from acknowledging or recognizing those efforts as an accomplished fact.
There remains, of course, the question of what the West can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal efforts from becoming accomplished facts.
One ground of action certainly exists when fusillades of stray shots go over into West Berlin as Communist vopos try to gun down fleeing unarmed residents.
Another remained when an American Army car was recovered but with a broken glass.
The glass may seem trivial but Communist official hooliganism feeds on such incidents unless they are redressed.
Remembering the step-by-step fate of Danzig and the West German misgivings about salami tactics, it is to be hoped that the dispatch of General Clay to West Berlin as President Kennedy's representative will mark a stiffening of response not only to future indignities and aggressions but also to some that have passed.
Prairie National Park thousands of buffalo ( bison they will never be to the man on the street ) grazing like a mobile brown throw-rug upon the rolling, dusty-green grassland.
A horizon even and seamless, binding the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth.
That picture of the American prairie is as indelibly fixed in the memory of those who have studied the conquest of the American continent as any later cinema image of the West made in live-oak canyons near Hollywood.
For it was the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless seas of grass that symbolized for a whole generation of Americans the abundant supply that was to take many of them westward when the Ohio and Mississippi valleys began to fill.
The National Park Service now proposes to preserve an area in Pottawatomie County, northeast Kansas, as a Prairie National Park.
There the buffalo would roam, to be seen as a tapestry, not as moth-eaten zoo specimens.
Wooded stream valleys in the folds of earth would be saved.
Grasslands would extend, unfenced, unplowed, unbroken by silo or barn -- as the first settlers saw them.
The Park Service makes an impressive ecological and statistical case for creating this new park.
American history should clinch the case when Congress is asked to approve.
Whisky on the air a Philadelphia distiller is currently breaching the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertising on *j and radio.
Starting with small stations not members of the National Association of Broadcasters, the firm apparently is seeking to break down the anti-liquor barriers in major-market stations.
Probably the best answer to this kind of entering wedge is congressional action requiring the Federal Communications Commission to ban such advertising through its licensing power.
The National Association of Broadcasters code specifically bars hard-liquor commercials.
Past polls of public opinion show popular favor for this policy.
Even the Distilled Spirits Institute has long had a specific prohibition.
Why, then, with these voluntary barricades and some state laws barring liquor ads, is it necessary to seek congressional action?
Simply because the subverting action of firms that are not members of the Distilled Spirits Institute and of radio and *j stations that are not members of the *j tends to spread.
Soon some members of the two industry groups doubtless will want to amend their codes on grounds that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the efforts of non-code competitors.
Although the false glamour surrounding bourbon or other whisky commercials is possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which *j soft-drinks are downed or toothpaste applied, there is a sad difference between enticing a viewer into sipping Oopsie-*cola and gulling him into downing bourbon.
A law is needed.
New York : Democrats' choice registered Democrats in New York City this year have the opportunity to elect their party's candidates for Mayor and other municipal posts and the men who will run their party organization.
In the central contest, that for Mayor, they may have found some pertinent points in what each faction has said about the other.
Mayor Robert F. Wagner must, as his opponents demand, assume responsibility for his performance in office.
While all citizens share in blame for lax municipal ethics the Wagner regime has seen serious problems in the schools, law enforcement and fiscal policies.
The Mayor is finding it awkward to campaign against his own record.
State Controller Arthur Levitt, on the other hand, cannot effectively deny that he has chosen to be the candidate of those party leaders who as a rule have shown livelier interest in political power than in the city's welfare.
They, too, have links with the city's ills.
Both men are known to be honest and public-spirited.
Mayor Wagner's shortcomings have perhaps been more mercilessly exposed than those of Mr. Levitt who left an impression of quiet competence in his more protected state post.
As Mayor, Mr. Levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of his leading supporters would like.
His election, on the other hand, would unquestionably strengthen the regulars.
Mr. Wagner might or might not be a new Mayor in this third term, now that he is free of the pressure of those party leaders whom he calls bosses.
These are, of course, the same people whose support he has only now rejected to seek the independent vote.
But his reelection would strengthen the liberal Democrats and the labor unions who back him.
If this choice is less exciting than New York Democrats may wish, it nevertheless must be made.
The vote still gives citizens a voice in the operation of their government and their party.
Little war, big test both Mr. *j have so far continued to speak softly and carry big sticks over Laos.
President Kennedy, already two quiet demands down, still refused Thursday to be drawn into delivering a public ultimatum to Moscow.
But at the same time he moved his helicopter-borne marines to within an hour of the fighting.
And Secretary Rusk, en route to Bangkok, doubtless is trying to make emergency arrangements for the possible entry of Australian or Thai *j forces.
For Mr. Kennedy, speaking softly and carrying a sizable stick is making the best of a bad situation.
The new President is in no position to start out his dealings with Moscow by issuing callable bluffs.
He must show at the outset that he means exactly what he says.
In this case he has put the alternatives clearly to Mr. Khrushchev for the third time.
At his press conference Mr. Kennedy said, all we want in Laos is peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn.
At the scene he has just as clearly shown his military strength in unprovocative but ready position.
Since Laos is of no more purely military value to Moscow itself than it is to Washington, this approach might be expected to head off Mr. Khrushchev for the moment.
But because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in Laos, the Soviet leader must be tempted to let things ride -- a course that would appear to cost him little on the spot, but would bog Washington in a tactical mess.
As wars go, Laos is an extremely little one.
Casualties have been running about a dozen men a day.
The hard core of the pro-*communist rebel force numbers only some 2,000 tough Viet Minh guerrilla fighters.
But for the United States and its *j allies to attempt to shore up a less tough, less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded, road-shy, guerrilla-th'-wisp terrain is a risk not savored by Pentagon planners.
But if anything can bring home to Mr. Khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watching this Braddock-against-the-*indiansjj contest, it will probably be the fact that *j forces are ready to attempt it -- plus the fact that Moscow has something to lose from closing off disarmament and other bigger negotiations with Washington.
Fortunately both the Republicans and America's chief Western allies now are joined behind the neutral Laos aim of the President.
Actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now has swung fully behind the British policy of seeking to achieve a neutral Laos via the international bargaining table.
It is ironic that Washington is having to struggle so for a concept that for six years it bypassed as unreasonable.
The State Department tacitly rejected the neutral Laos idea after the Geneva conference of 1954, and last year Washington backed the rightist coup that ousted neutral Premier Souvanna Phouma.
But since last fall the United States has been moving toward a pro-neutralist position and now is ready to back the British plan for a cease-fire patrolled by outside observers and followed by a conference of interested powers.
The road to a guaranteed-neutral, coup-proof Laos is today almost as difficult as warfare on that nation's terrain.
But for the safety of Southeast Asia, and for the sake of the Laotian people -- who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engaged in the fighting -- this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war had to be made.
The world awaits Mr. Khrushchev's choice of alternatives.
A vote for educational *j the Senate's overwhelming ( 64-13 ) vote to support locally controlled educational *j efforts should be emulated in the lower house.
Twice previously the Senate has approved measures backing *j and the House has let them die.
But this year prospects may be better.
The House communications subcommittee is expected to report out a good bill calling for the states to match federal funds.
This year's Senate measure would provide each state and the District of Columbia with $1,000,000 to be used in support of private, state, or municipal *j efforts.
The funds would be used for equipment, not for land, buildings, or operation.
The relatively few communities that have educational stations have found them of considerable value.
But, lacking money from commercial sponsors, the stations have had difficulties meeting expenses or improving their service.
Other communities -- the ones to be aided most by the Senate bill -- have had difficulty starting such stations because of the high initial cost of equipment.
A good man departs.
Goodby, Mr. Sam.
Sam Rayburn was a good man, a good American, and, third, a good Democrat.
He was all of these rolled into one sturdy figure ; Mr. Speaker, Mr. Sam, and Mr. Democrat, at one and the same time.
The House was his habitat and there he flourished, first as a young representative, then as a forceful committee chairman, and finally in the post for which he seemed intended from birth, Speaker of the House, and second most powerful man in Washington.
Mr. Rayburn was not an easy man to classify or to label.
He was no flaming liberal, yet the New Deal, the Fair Deal and the New Frontier needed him.
He was not a rear-looking conservative, yet partisans of that persuasion will miss him as much as any.
Two of the vital qualities demanded of a politician by other politicians are that he always keep a confidence and that he keep his word.
Sam Rayburn took unnumbered secrets with him to the grave, for he was never loquacious, and his word, once given, was not subject to retraction.
It might be added that as he kept his word so he expected that others keep theirs.
The demonstration of his power was never flamboyant or theatrical.
His leadership was not for audiences.
A growl, a nod, was usually enough.
When it was not, one of the great dramas of Washington would be presented.
He would rise in the well of the House, his chin upon his chest, his hands gripping the side of a desk, and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence.
He spoke briefly, sensibly, to the point and without oratorical flourishes.
He made good, plain American common sense and the House usually recognized it and acted upon it.
These public efforts were rare because Mr. Rayburn normally did his counseling, persuading and educating long before an issue reached its test on the House floor.
He expected Democrats to do their duty when it had been patiently pointed out to them.
With his long service he had a long memory, an excellent thing in a political leader.
He was, of course, in the House for a very long time.
There are only two men remaining in Congress who, with Rayburn, voted for the declaration of war against Germany in 1917.
To almost two generations of Americans it must have seemed as though the existence of Mr. Sam coincided with that of the House.
And it was the House he loved.
To be presiding officer of it was the end of his desire and ambition.
The Senate to him was not the upper body and he corrected those who said he served under the president.
He served with him.
Sound the roll of those with whom he served and who preceded him in death.
Woodrow Wilson, with whom he began his years in Washington, Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge, *j, with whom he managed a social revolution.
And those still with us, Herbert C. Hoover, Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy.
He was a fighter for those of his own party.
Mr. Truman has only to recall the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he was and the first experience of Mr. Kennedy with Congress would have been sadder than it was had not Mr. Sam been there.
As it was, his absence because of his final illness was a blow to the administration.
With Republican presidents, he fought fair.
He was his own man, not an automatic obstructionist.
He kept his attacks on Republicanism for partisan campaigns, but that is part of the game he was born to play.
Under any name -- Mr. Speaker, Mr. Democrat, Mr. Sam -- he was a good man.
*j off the Congo track thirteen Italian airmen who went to the Congo to serve the cause of peace under the United Nations banner have instead met violent death at the hands of Congolese troops supposedly their friends.
In 18 months, no more grisly incident has been reported from that jungle.
Simply out of bloodlust, their murderers dismembered the bodies and tossed the remains into the river.
The excuse was offered for them that they had mistaken the Italians for Belgian mercenaries.
In other words, atrocities by savages wearing the uniform of the central government might be condoned, had the victims been serving the cause of dissident Katanga.
Does this suggest that the Congo is fit for nationhood or that *j is making any progress whatever toward its goal of so making it?
To the contrary, through the past six weeks violence has been piled upon violence.
Mass rapes, troop mutinies, uncontrolled looting and pillage and reckless military adventures, given no sanction by any political authority, have become almost daily occurrences.
Yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy is not the work of Katanga.
It happens in the territory of the Leopoldville government, which is itself a fiction, demonstrably incapable of governing, and commanding only such limited credit abroad as *j support gives it.
The main question raised by the incident is how much longer will *j bury its head in the sand on the Congo problem instead of facing the bitter fact that it has no solution in present terms?
The probable answer is that it will do so just as long as Russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young African nations wake up to the truth that out of false pride they are visiting ruin on Central Africa.
Right now, they are pushing a resolution which would have *j use its forces to invade and subjugate Katanga.
That notion is fantastically wrong-headed from several points of view.
The *j army is too weak, too demoralized for the task.
Further, it has its work cut out stopping anarchy where it is now garrisoned.
Last, it makes no sense to deliver Katanga, the one reasonably solid territory, into the existing chaos.
The Congo should have been mandated, because it was not ready for independence.
The idea was not even suggested because political expediency prevailed over wisdom.
It is perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it is inconsistent with what is termed political realism.
But if any realism and feeling for truth remain in the General Assembly, it is time for men of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach.
Otherwise, *j will march blindly on to certain defeat.
Featherbed reversal a recent editorial discussing a labor-management agreement reached between the Southern Pacific Co. and the Order of Railroad Telegraphers has been criticized on the grounds that it was not based on complete information.
The editorial was based on a news association dispatch which said that the telegraphers had secured an agreement whereby they were guaranteed 40 hours' pay per week whether they worked or not and that a reduction in their number was limited to 2 per cent per year.
Our comment was that this was featherbedding in its ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad was misplaced since it had entered into such an agreement.
The statement was also made that undoubtedly the railroad had received some compensating benefit from the telegraphers, but that it was difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life.
Additional information supplied to us discloses that the railroad gained a stabilized supply of telegraphers of which it was in need.
Also, normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic.
The situation with regard to the Southern Pacific was therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situations in other industries.
The solution reached in the agreement was more acceptable to the railroad than that originally included in a series of union demands.
Meditations from a fallout shelter time was when the house of delegates of the American Bar association leaned to the common sense side.
But the internationalists have taken over the governing body of the bar, and when the lads met in St. Louis, it was not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the United Nations was scarcely less than wonderful, despite an imperfection here and there.
It was, the brief writers decided, man's best hope for a peaceful and law abiding world.
Peace, it's wonderful, and world law, it's wonderful, too, and shouldn't we get an international covenant extending it into space, before the Russians put some claim jumper on the moon?
Meanwhile, in Moscow, Khrushchev was adding his bit to the march of world law by promising to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million tons of *j, to knock sense into the heads of those backward oafs who can't see the justice of surrendering West Berlin to communism.
A nuclear pacifier of these dimensions -- roughly some six and a half times bigger than anything the United States has triggered experimentally -- would certainly produce a bigger bang, and, just for kicks, Khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegates from St. Louis to the moon, where there wouldn't even be any beer to drink.
While he was at it, the philosopher of the Kremlin contributed an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellowing at those in the west who can't appreciate coexistence thru suicide.
Fools, he bayed, what do you think you are doing?
The only response we can think of is the humble one that at least we aren't playing the marimba with our shoes in the United Nations, but perhaps the heavy domes in the house of delegates can improve on this feeble effort.
Another evidence of the spreading rule of reason was provided from Mexico City with the daily hijacking of an American plane by a demented Algerian with a gun.
The craft made the familiar unwelcome flight to Havana, where, for some unknown reason, Castro rushed to the airport to express mortification to the Colombian foreign minister, a passenger, who is not an admirer of old Ten O'*clock Shadow.
The plane was sent back to the United States, for a change, but Castro kept the crazy gunman, who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution.
Less respect for the legal conventions was displayed by Castro's right hand man, Che Guevara, who edified the Inter-*american Economic and Social council meeting in Montevideo by reading two secret American documents purloined from the United States embassy at Caracas, Venezuela.
The contents were highly embarrassing to American spokesmen, who were on hand to promise Latin Americans a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium.
Perhaps the moralities of world law are not advanced by stealing American diplomatic papers and planes, but the Kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that, but for its own incompetence in protecting American interests, these things would not happen.
The same can be said about the half-hearted Cuban invasion mounted by the administration last April, which, we trust, is not symptomatic of the methods to be invoked in holding off the felonious Khrushchev.
Pass the iron rations, please, and light another candle, for it's getting dark down here and we're minded to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away.
The customer loses again.
The board of suspension of the Interstate Commerce commission has ordered a group of railroads not to reduce their freight rates on grain, as they had planned to do this month.
The request for lower rates originated with the Southern railway, which has spent a good deal of time and money developing a 100-ton hopper car with which it says it can move grain at about half what it costs in the conventional, smaller car.
By reducing rates as much as 60 per cent, it and its associated railroads hope to win back some of the business they have lost to truckers and barge lines.
The board's action shows what free enterprise is up against in our complex maze of regulatory laws.
A shock wave from Africa word of Dag Hammarskjold's death in an African plane crash has sent a shockwave around the globe.
As head of the United Nations he was the symbol of world peace, and his tragic end came at a moment when peace hangs precariously.
It was on the eve of a momentous U.*n. session to come to grips with cold war issues.
His firm hand will be desperately missed.
Mr. Hammarskjold was in Africa on a mission of peace.
He had sought talks with Moise Tshombe, the secessionist president of Congo's Katanga province where recent fighting had been bloody.
He earnestly urged a cease-fire.
The story of the fatal crash is not fully known.
The U.*n.-chartered plane which was flying from the conference city of Ndola in Northern Rhodesia had been riddled with machinegun bullets last weekend and was newly repaired.
Whether this, or overt action, was the cause of the crash must be promptly determined.
The death of Mr. Hammarskjold removes the United Nations' most controversial leader.
He was controversial because he was uncompromising for peace and freedom with justice.
He courageously defended the rights of small nations, and he stood his ground against the savage attacks of the Communist bloc.
The Congo, in whose cause he died, was the scene of one of his greatest triumphs.
His policies had resolved the conflicts that threatened to ignite the cold war and workable solutions were beginning to take shape.
When the recent Katangan outbreaks imperiled these solutions Mr. Hammarskjold, despite the danger, flew to exert a calming influence.
He gave his life for his beliefs.
The U.*n. session scheduled for today will meet under the cloud of his passing.
It is a crucial session with the world on the edge of momentous developments.
If the manner of his passing moves the nations to act in the spirit of his dedication the sore issues that plague the world can yet be resolved with reason and justice.
That is the hope of mankind.
Monument to togetherness reaching agreement on projects of value to the whole community has long been one of Greater Miami's hardest tasks.
Too many have bogged down in bickering.
Even when public bodies arrived at a consensus, at least one dissenting vote has been usual.
So we note approvingly a fresh sample of unanimity.
All nine members of the Inter-*american Center Authority voted for Goodbody & Company's proposal to finance the long-awaited trade and cultural center.
The widely known financial firm has 60 days to spell out the terms of its contract.
If the indenture is accepted, the authority will proceed to validate a bond issue repayable from revenue.
Then Goodbody will hand over a minimum of $15.5 million for developing the spacious Graves Tract to house the center.
The next step awaits approval today by the Metro commissioners as the members of the Dade County Port Authority.
They allotted $500,000 three years ago to support Interama until its own financing could be arranged.
Less than half the sum has been spent, since the Interama board pinched pennies during that period of painstaking negotiations.
The balance is being budgeted for the coming year.
Unanimity on Interama is not surprising.
It is one of the rare public ventures here on which nearly everyone is agreed.
The City of Miami recently yielded a prior claim of $8.5 million on the Graves Tract to clear the way for the project.
County officials have cooperated consistently.
So have the people's elected spokesmen at the state and federal levels.
Interama, as it rises, will be a living monument to Greater Miami's ability to get together on worthwhile enterprises.
A short report and a good one progress, or lack of it, toward civil rights in the 50 states is reported in an impressive 689-page compilation issued last week by the United States Commission on Civil Rights.
Much happened in this field during the past 12 months.
Each state advisory committee documented its own activity.
Some accounts are quite lengthy but Florida's is the shortest of all, requiring only four paragraphs.
The established pattern of relative calm in the field of race relations has continued in all areas, reported this group headed by Harold Colee of Jacksonville and including two South Floridians, William D. Singer and John B. Turner of Miami.
No complaints or charges have been filed during the past year, either verbally or written, from any individual or group.
The committee continues to feel that Florida has progressed in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local levels in its efforts to review and assess transition problems as they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil rights.
Problems have arisen in this sensitive field but have been handled in most cases with understanding and restraint.
The progress reported by the advisory committee is real.
While some think we move too fast and others too slowly, Florida's record is a good one and stands out among the 50.
West Germany remains Western West Germany will face the crucial tests that lie ahead, on Berlin and unification, with a coalition government.
This is the key fact emerging from Sunday's national election.
Chancellor Adenauer's Christian Democratic Party slipped only a little in the voting but it was enough to lose the absolute Bundestag majority it has enjoyed since 1957.
In order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival parties which gained strength.
Inevitably this means some compromise.
The aging chancellor in all likelihood will be retired.
Both Willy Brandt's Social Democrats, who gained 22 seats in the new parliament, and the Free Democrats, who picked up 23, will insist on that before they enter the government.
Moon-faced Ludwig Erhart, the economic expert, probably will ascend to the leadership long denied him.
If he becomes chancellor, Dr. Erhart would make few changes.
The wizard who fashioned West Germany's astonishing industrial rebirth is the soul of free enterprise.
He is dedicated to building the nation's strength and, as are all West Germans, to a free Berlin and to reunion with captive East Germany.
What is in doubt as the free Germans and their allies consider the voting trends is the nature of the coalition that will result.
If the party of Adenauer and Erhart, with 45 per cent of the vote, approaches the party of Willy Brandt, which won 36 per cent, the result would be a stiffening of the old resolve.
West Berlin's Mayor Brandt vigorously demanded a firmer stand on the dismemberment of his city and won votes by it.
The Free Democrats ( 12 per cent of the vote ) believe a nuclear war can be avoided by negotiating with the Soviet Union, and more dealings with the Communist bloc.
The question left by the election is whether West Germany veers slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility.
It could go either way, since the gains for both points of view were about the same.
Regardless of the decision two facts are clear.
West Germany, with its industrial and military might, reaffirmed its democracy and remains firm with the free nations.
And the career of Konrad Adenauer, who upheld Germany's tradition of rock-like leaders which Bismarck began, draws near the end.
Better ask before joining Americans are a nation of joiners, a quality which our friends find endearing and sometimes amusing.
But it can be dangerous if the joiner doesn't want to make a spectacle of himself.
For instance, so-called conservative organizations, some of them secret, are sprouting in the garden of joining where liberal organizations once took root.
One specific example is a secret fraternity which will coordinate anti-*communist efforts.
The principle is commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody is going to get gulled.
According to The Chicago Tribune News Service, State Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk of California has devised a series of questions which the joiner might well ask about any organization seeking his money and his name : 1.
Does it assail schools and churches with blanket accusations?
2.
Does it attack other traditional American institutions with unsupportable and wild charges?
3.
Does it put the label of un-*american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagrees politically?
4.
Does it attempt to rewrite modern history by blaming American statesmen for wars, Communism, depression, and other troubles of the world?
5.
Does it employ crude pressure tactics with such means as anonymous telephone calls and letter writing campaigns?
6.
Do its spokesmen seem more interested in the amount of money they collect than in the principles they purport to advocate?
In some instances a seventh question can be added : 7.
Does the organization show an affinity for a foreign government, political party or personality in opposition or preference to the American system?
If the would-be joiner asks these questions he is not likely to be duped by extremists who are seeking to capitalize on the confusions and the patriotic apprehensions of Americans in a troubled time.
Falling somewhere in a category between Einstein's theory and sand fleas -- difficult to see but undeniably there, nevertheless -- is the tropical green city of Islandia, a string of offshore islands that has almost no residents, limited access and an unlimited future.
The latter is what concerns us all.
Whatever land you can see here, from the North tip end of Elliott Key looking southward, belongs to someone -- people who have title to the land.
And what you can't see, the land underneath the water, belongs to someone, too.
The public.
The only real problem is to devise a plan whereby the owners of the above-water land can develop their property without the public losing its underwater land and the right to its development for public use and enjoyment.
In the fairly brief but hectic history of Florida, the developers of waterfront land have too often wound up with both their land and ours.
In this instance, happily, insistence is being made that our share is protected.
And until this protection is at least as concrete as, say, the row of hotels that bars us from our own sands at Miami Beach, those who represent us all should agree to nothing.
Closed doors in city hall the reaction of certain City Council members to California's newest anti-secrecy laws was as dismaying as it was disappointing.
We had assumed that at least this local legislative body had nothing to hide, and, therefore, had no objections to making the deliberations of its committees and the city commissions available to the public.
In the preamble to the open-meeting statutes, collectively known as the Brown Act, the Legislature declares that the public commissions, boards and councils and other public agencies in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business.
It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.
The people of this state do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies that serve them.
The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know.
The full implementation of these noble words, however, has taken the efforts of five sessions of the Legislature.
Since 1953 California has led the nation in enacting guarantees that public business shall be publicly conducted, but not until this year did the lawmakers in Sacramento plug the remaining loopholes in the Brown Act.
Despite the lip service paid by local governments, the anti-secrecy statutes have been continuously subverted by reservations and rationalizations.
When all else fails, it is argued that open sessions slow down governmental operations.
We submit that this is a most desirable effect of the law -- and one of its principal aims.
Without public scrutiny the deliberations of public agencies would no doubt be conducted more speedily.
But the citizens would, of course, never be sure that the decisions that resulted were as correct as they were expeditious.
Help when needed if the Dominican Republic achieves free, democratic government, it will be due in large part to the U.*s. show of force that enabled President Balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of Trujillo dictatorship.
Outwardly, Ciudad Trujillo is calm.
None of the Trujillo family remains.
Mr. Balaguer is in control, and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring.
Had U.*s. warships not appeared off the Dominican coast, there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war.
Ultimately either the Trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by Dominican elements responsive to Castro in Cuba.
Within the Organization of American States, there may be some criticism of this unilateral American intervention which was not without risk obviously.
But there was no complaint from the Dominican crowds which lined Ciudad Trujillo's waterfront shouting, vive Yankees ] more, the U.*s. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader, Dr. Juan Bosch, as having saved many lives and many troubles in the near future.
Mr. Balaguer's troubles are by no means over.
He will need the help of all *j members to eradicate, finally, the forces of authoritarianism, pro-*trujillo and pro-*castro alike.
In cooperating toward that objective, *j might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the United States.
Matter of survival those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935.
Now, as then, it is a matter of jobs.
Craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim, such as factory maintenance.
The issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the American Federation of Labor of its industrial union members.
That breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations.
Or that's what it looked like at the time.
But automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs.
Walter Reuther, leader of the industrial union faction of the *j, says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all American labor.
Whether it could be as disastrous for American labor as, say, Jimmy Hoffa of the Teamsters, is a matter of conjecture.
But the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friends for labor.
Engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival, this country can have little patience with labor's family feuds.
The concept of labor as a special class is outmoded, and in the task confronting America as bastion of the free world, labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive.
Deterrent the Army, Navy and Air Force, among others, may question Secretary Freeman's claim that the high estate of United States agriculture is the strongest deterrent to the spread of communism.
But the secretary insists that the success of the American farmer is the greatest single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world.
Mr. Freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by America's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production -- or even by the Soviet's successes in space.
This shouldn't surprise the secretary ; American taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long, long time.
In fact, over the years, the American farmer's capacity to over-produce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar.
And thus far, Mr. Freeman has offered very little relief.
The 1961 feed grain program, which the secretary sponsored, has been declared a billion dollar fiasco.
In exchange for higher price supports, growers pledged reduction in planted acreage.
But the farmers outsmarted Washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer.
The result : $1.1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget.
Perhaps, as Mr. Freeman says, American agriculture may stop the Communists, but it is also swindling the American taxpayer.
What's wrong at state a senate subcommittee headed by Sen. Jackson of Washington has been going over the State Department and has reached some predictable conclusions.
The department needs a clearer sense of direction at the top and it needs fewer, but better, people, Sen. Jackson says.
The subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department.
President Kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance.
But those who would revitalize so complex an organization must, first of all, overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures, suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes.
Nor does Sen. Jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the White House of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy.
This tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for Secretary Rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates.
But competent observers believe he is making progress, particularly toward what Sen. Jackson lists as the primary need -- a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them.
The Jackson report will provide some of the political support Mr. Rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged, as Sen. Jackson puts it, in work that does not really need doing.
Mr. Rusk should also draw comfort from Sen. Jackson's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved.
Self-criticism is a rare but needed commodity in Congress.
Betting men forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist.
But now apparently the job of Secretary of Labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends.
James P. Mitchell, when he was the head of the department, promised to eat his hat if unemployment didn't drop below three million a couple of years ago.
He lost, but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora.
His successor, Secretary Goldberg, also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months.
No betting man, Mr. Goldberg says he's merely putting my neck out again by predicting the rate will go down this month.
He is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride -- a new record high in personal income, an increase in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods.
Mr. Mitchell had an excuse for losing -- the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated.
Mr. Goldberg has less reason for missing.
The economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they can't be blamed in November.
The odds thus appear favorable that the secretary's neck may be spared.
Little resistance Cambodia's chief of state, who has been accused of harboring Communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring South Viet Nam and Thailand, insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in Southeast Asia.
But so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is Prince Sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel.
I have to see the facts, is the way the prince puts it.
And from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a pro-*western posture.
Prince Sihanouk's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions.
Bottom sighted Commerce Secretary Hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official Washington's economic forecasters.
Weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the Cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement.
Recently Treasury Secretary Dillon and Labor Secretary Goldberg fell into line with Mr. Hodges' appraisal, though there has been some reluctance to do so at the White House.
And now Mr. Hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point.
He is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump.
The secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales.
February's volume was 1 per cent above January's for the first pickup since last October, although it's still 1.5 per cent off from February 1960.
Corroborating Mr. Hodges' figures was the Federal Reserve Board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending March 4.
In Newark, for example, this gain was put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level.
Of course, some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that Easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960.
Another optimistic sign, this one from the Labor Department, was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments was interrupted for the first time in the week ending Feb. 25.
Initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week ending March 4.
Mr. Hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he doesn't think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes.
Well, we can't have everything.
Prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut.
In New Jersey, too New Jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to the sea, for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain.
Now the Stone Harbor bird sanctuary, 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons, is threatened, but the battlefront extends far beyond our state.
Against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of Cape Cod shoreline, the tiny tract at Stone Harbor may seem unimportant.
But Interior Secretary Udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves.
The move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of Cape Cod, from Provincetown to Chatham, is strengthened by President Kennedy's interest in that area.
But preservation of the natural beauty of the Cape is of more than regional concern, for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country.
By comparison, Stone Harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable, for aside from the Audubon Society, they are mostly the snowy, common and cattle egrets and the Louisiana, green, little blue and black-crowned herons who nest and feed there.
But there is hope, for Conservation Commissioner Bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space.
The desirability of preserving such places as the Cape dunes and Stone Harbor sanctuary becomes more apparent every year.
Public sentiment for conserving our rich natural heritage is growing.
But that heritage is shrinking even faster.
No joyride much of the glamor President Kennedy's Peace Corps may have held for some prospective applicants has been removed by Sargent Shriver, the head corpsman.
Anybody who is expecting a joyride should, according to Mr. Shriver, get off the train right now.
First of all, the recruits will have to undergo arduous schooling.
It will be a 16-hour training day.
Then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet, culture, language and living conditions will be different.
And the pay, of course, will be nil.
Despite all this, the idea apparently has captured the imagination of countless youths whose parents are probably more surprised by the response than anybody else.
The study of the St. Louis area's economic prospects prepared for the Construction Industry Joint Conference confirms and reinforces both the findings of the Metropolitan St. Louis Survey of 1957 and the easily observed picture of the Missouri-*illinois countryside.
St. Louis sits in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some places stagnant mid-continent region.
Slackened regional demand for St. Louis goods and services reflects the region's relative lack of purchasing power.
Not all St. Louis industries, of course, have a market area confined to the immediate neighborhood.
But for those which do, the slow growth of the area has a retarding effect on the metropolitan core.
The city has a stake in stimulating growth and purchasing power throughout outstate Missouri and Southern Illinois.
Gov. Dalton's New Commerce and Industry Commission is moving to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry.
That is one approach.
Another would be to take the advice of Dr. Elmer Ellis, president of the University of Missouri, and provide for an impartial professional analysis of Missouri's economy.
He says the state, in order to proceed with economic development, must develop an understanding of how the various parts of its economy fit together and dovetail into the national economy.
The research center of the University's School of Business and Public Administration is prepared to undertake the analysis Dr. Ellis has been talking about.
He and Dean John W. Schwada of the Business School outlined the project at a recent conference.
The University can make a valuable contribution to the state's economic development through such a study.
In Southern Illinois, the new federal program of help to economically depressed areas ought to provide some stimulus to growth.
The Carbondale Industrial Development Corp. has obtained a $500,000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new jobs.
Carbondale is in the Herrin-*murphysboro-*west Frankfort labor market, where unemployment has been substantially higher than the national average.
The Federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on Missouri's depressed areas, and in the long run that will benefit St. Louis as well.
Politics-ridden St. Clair county in Illinois presents another piece of the problem of metropolitan development.
More industrial acreage lies vacant in St. Clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the St. Louis area.
The unstable political situation there represents one reason new plants shy away from the East Side.
And then there is St. Louis county, where the Democratic leadership has shown little appreciation of the need for sound zoning, of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth.
St. Louis county under its present leadership also has largely closed its eyes to the need for governmental reform, and permitted parochial interests to take priority over area-wide interests.
Some plant-location specialists take these signs to mean St. Louis county doesn't want industry, and so they avoid the area, and more jobs are lost.
Metropolitan St. Louis's relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political, business, civic and other leaders on both sides of the Mississippi.
Without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area's economy, there will not be sufficient jobs for the growing numbers of youngsters, and St. Louis will slip into second-class status.
An excess of zeal many of our very best friends are reformers.
Still we must confess that sometimes some of them go too far.
Take, for example, the reformers among New York City's Democrats.
Having whipped Mr. De Sapio in the primaries and thus come into control of Tammany Hall, they have changed the name to Chatham Hall.
Even though headquarters actually have been moved into the Chatham building, do they believe that they can make the new name stick?
Granted that the Tammany name and the Tammany tiger often were regarded as badges of political shame, the sachems of the Hall also have a few good marks to their credit.
But it is tradition rather than the record which balks at the expunging of the Tammany name.
After all, it goes back to the days in which sedition was not un-*american, the days in which the Sons of St. Tammany conspired to overthrow the government by force and violence -- the British government, that is.
Further, do our reforming friends really believe that the cartoonists will consent to the banishment of the tiger from their zoo?
They will -- when they give up the donkey and the elephant.
Instead of attempting the impossible, why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger's stripes are not black?
That might go over.
The Faget case the White House itself has taken steps to remove a former Batista official, Col. Mariano Faget, from his preposterous position as interrogator of Cuban refugees for the Immigration Service.
The Faget appointment was preposterous on several grounds.
The Kennedy Administration had assured anti-*castro Cubans that it would have nothing to do with associates of Dictator Batista.
Using a Batista man to screen refugees represented a total misunderstanding of the democratic forces which alone can effectively oppose Castro.
Moreover, Col. Faget's information on Cuba was too outdated to be useful in screening Castro agents ; the Colonel fled to the friendly haven of the Dominican dictatorship as soon as Castro seized power.
And while he had headed Batista's anti-*communist section, the Batista regime did not disturb the Communists so much as more open opponents who were alleged to be Communists.
Responsibility for the Faget appointment rests with Gen. J. M. Swing, an Eisenhower appointee as head of the Immigration Service.
Gen. Swing has received public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogatives of his office.
His official term expired last summer.
Some reports say he was rescued from timely retirement by his friend, Congressman Walter of Pennsylvania, at a moment when the Kennedy Administration was diligently searching for all the House votes it could get.
Congressman Walter has been all-powerful in immigration matters, but he has announced plans to retire in 1962.
At that point the Administration will have little reason to hang onto Gen. Swing.
The Faget case was the kind of salvage job the Administration should not have to repeat.
Mr. Eisenhower, politician as President, Dwight D. Eisenhower often assumed a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics.
As a former President, however, Mr. Eisenhower abandoned this role to engage in partisan sniping during a New York Republican rally, and generally missed his target.
Mr. Eisenhower seized upon the incident of the postcard lost by a Peace Corps girl in Nigeria to attack the entire Corps as a juvenile experiment and to suggest sending a Corps member to the moon.
This was juvenile ridicule.
Nowhere did the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the Corps or its welcome reception abroad.
His words were the more ungracious to come from a man who lent his name to the Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships dedicated to the same goal of international understanding.
The former President blithely ignored recent history in speaking of dollarette dollars under Kennedy Administration fiscal policies.
It was the Eisenhower Administration which produced the largest peacetime deficit.
Finally, Mr. Eisenhower found nothing but confusion in Washington.
This statement recalls the 1959 Berlin crisis, when President Eisenhower first told reporters that Berlin could not be defended with conventional weapons and then added that a nuclear defense was out of the picture too.
The crisis has been renewed since then but the confusion has hardly been compounded.
Ex-*presidents, relieved of accountability for policy, sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for their words.
Some of former President Truman's off-the-cuff discourses have been in that vein.
Nobody can deny the right of former Chief Executives to take part in politics, but the American people expect them always to remember the obligations of national leadership and to treat issues with a sense of responsibility.
This is a matter of respect for the Presidency.
Mr. Eisenhower's New York speech does not encourage respect for that or for his elder statesmanship.
Queen of the seas the Queen Mary has long been a symbol of speed, luxury, and impeccable British service on the high seas.
Reports that the venerable liner, which has been in service since 1936, was to be retired struck a nostalgic note in many of us.
But the Cunard line, influenced by unpleasant economic facts and not sentiment, has decided to keep the Queen Mary in service until next Spring at least.
A new queen, with the prosaic title of *j, had been planned for several years to replace the Queen Mary.
The British government, concerned about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry, had put through a bill to give Cunard loans and grants totaling $50,400,000 toward the $84,000,000 cost of a new 75,000-ton passenger liner.
Since 1957, more and more trans-*atlantic passengers have been crossing by air.
Economy class fares and charter flights have attracted almost all new passengers to the airlines.
Competition from other steamship lines has cut Cunard's share of sea passengers from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line showed a marked drop of profits on the Atlantic run.
The Cunard line has under consideration replacing the Queen Mary with a ship smaller than 75,000 tons.
This would be cheaper to operate and could be used for cruises during the lean winter months.
Also under consideration is an increased investment in Cunard Eagle Airways which has applied to serve New York.
The decline of the Cunard line from its position of dominance in Atlantic travel is a significant development in the history of transportation.
Mission to Viet Nam Gen. Maxwell Taylor's statement in Saigon that he is very much encouraged about the chances of the pro-*western government of Viet Nam turning back Communist guerrilla attacks comes close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatching United States troops to bolster the Vietnamese Army.
Gen. Taylor will report to President Kennedy in a few days on the results of his visit to South Viet Nam and, judging from some of his remarks to reporters in the Far East, he is likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of Vietnamese military, economic, political and other resources.
There was good reason for Gen. Taylor to make an inspection trip at this time.
Communist guerrillas recently have been reported increasing their activities and the great flood of the Mekong River has interposed a new crisis.
South Viet Nam's rice surplus for next year -- more than 300,000 tons -- may have been destroyed.
The Viet Cong, the Communist rebels, may have lost their stored grain and arms factories.
The rebels may try to seize what is left of the October harvest when the floods recede and the monsoon ends in November.
Nothing that is likely to happen, however, should prompt the sending of United States soldiers for other than instructional missions.
The Indochina struggle was a war to stay out of in 1954, when Gen. Ridgway estimated it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 divisions at the outset to win a war the French were losing.
It is a war to stay out of today, especially in view of the fact that President Ngo Dinh Diem apparently does not want United States troops.
He may want additional technical help, and this should be forthcoming.
South Viet Nam has received $1,450,000,000 in United States aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance has been stepped up since Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson's visit last May.
Gen. Taylor, the President's special military adviser, is a level-headed officer who is not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure.
It is probable that his recommendations will be informed and workable, and that they will not lead to involving the United States in an Asian morass.
Gov. John M. Dalton, himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government, spoke with rich background and experience when he said in an address here that lawyers ought to quit sitting in the Missouri General Assembly, or quit accepting fees from individuals and corporations who have controversies with or axes to grind with the government and who are retained, not because of their legal talents, but because of their government influence.
The U.*n's gravest crisis Ambassador Stevenson yesterday described the U.*n.'s problem of electing a temporary successor to the late Dag Hammarskjold as the gravest crisis the institution has faced.
Of course it is.
If the decision goes wrong, it may be -- as Mr. Stevenson fears -- the first step on the slippery path downhill to a U.*n. without operational responsibilities and without effective meaning.
The integrity of the office not merely requires that the Secretary General shall be, as the Charter puts it, the chief administrative officer of the Organization, but that neither he nor his staff shall seek or receive instructions from any government or any other authority external to the Organization.
In other words, the Secretary General is to be a nonpartisan, international servant, not a political, national one.
He should be, as Dag Hammarskjold certainly was, a citizen of the world.
The Charter does stipulate that due regard shall be paid to the importance of recruiting the staff on as wide a geographical basis as possible.
The United States and its allies have had no objection to this.
What they have objected to is the attempt of the Russians to make use of the tragedy of Dag Hammarskjold's death to turn the entire U.*n. staff from the Secretary down into political agents of the respective countries from which they come.
The controversy now revolves mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputies of the Secretary General and, more particularly, around the nature of his relationship with them.
Although the United States and the U.*s.*s.*r. have been arguing whether there shall be four, five or six top assistants, the most important element in the situation is not the number of deputies but the manner in which these deputies are to do their work.
If any one of them has any power to veto the Secretary General's decisions the nature of the organization will have changed.
If they give him advice when he asks it, or if they perform specified duties under his direction, the nature of the U. N. will not of necessity change.
The Secretary General must have, subject to the constitutional direction of the Security Council and the General Assembly, the power to act, to propose action and to organize action without being hobbled by advisers and assistants acting on someone else's instructions.
This is the root issue for which the United States should stand.
We should not become confused or let our public become confused over irrelevant questions of number or even of geography.
What we must have, if the United Nations is to survive, is as nonpolitical, nonpartisan an organization at the top as human beings can make it, subject to no single nation's direction and subservient to no single nation's ambition.
What the new charter does the new City Charter, which should get a Yes vote as Question No. 1 on Nov. 7, would not make a good Mayor out of a bad one.
There is no such magic in man-made laws.
But it would greatly strengthen any Mayor's executive powers, remove the excuse in large degree that he is a captive of inaction in the Board of Estimate, increase his budget-making authority both as to expense and capital budgets, and vest in him the right to reorganize city departments in the interest of efficiency and economy.
Lawmaking power is removed from the Board of Estimate and made a partnership responsibility of the City Council and the Mayor.
Thus there is a clearer division of authority, administrative and legislative.
The board is diminished in both respects, while it retains control over zoning, franchises, pier leases, sale, leasing and assignment of property, and other trusteeship functions.
The board will be able to increase, decrease, add or eliminate budget items, subject to the Mayor's veto ; but the City Council will now share fully this budget-altering power.
Overriding of mayoral veto on budget changes will require concurrence by board and Council, and a two-thirds vote.
The Controller retains his essential fiscal watchdog functions ; his broad but little used investigative powers are confirmed.
He loses now-misplaced tax collection duties, which go to the Finance Department.
On net balance, in spite of Controller Gerosa's opposition to the new Charter as an invasion of his office, the Controller will have the opportunity for greater usefulness to good government than he has now.
Borough Presidents, while retaining membership in the Board of Estimate, lose their housekeeping functions.
Highways go to a new Department of Highways, sewers to the Department of Public Works, such street cleaning as Borough Presidents now do ( in Queens and Richmond ) to the Sanitation Department.
Some fiscal changes are important.
The expense ( operating ) budget is to be a program budget, and red tape is cut to allow greater autonomy ( with the Mayor approving ) in fund transfers within a department.
The capital budget, for construction of permanent improvements, becomes an appropriating document instead of just a calendar of pious promises ; but, as a second-look safeguard, each new project must undergo a Board of Estimate public hearing before construction proceeds.
A road block to desirable local or borough improvements, heretofore dependent on the pocketbook vote of taxpayers and hence a drag on progress, is removed by making these a charge against the whole city instead of an assessment paid by those immediately affected.
This will have a beneficial effect by expediting public business ; it will also correct some injustices.
Enlargement of the City Council and a new method of selecting members will be discussed tomorrow.
Inter-american Press the Inter-american Press Association, which blankets the Western Hemisphere from northern Canada to Cape Horn, is meeting in New York City this week for the first time in eleven years.
The I. A. P. A. is a reflection of the problems and hopes of the hemisphere ; and in these days this inevitably means a concentration on the effects of the Cuban revolution.
As the press in Cuba was gradually throttled by the Castro regime, more and more Cuban publishers, editors and correspondents were forced into exile.
The I. A. P. A. found itself driven from journalism into politics as it did its best to bring about the downfall of the Castro Government and the return of the Cuban press to the freedom it knew before Batista's dictatorship began in 1952.
Freedom of the press was lost in Cuba because of decades of corruption and social imbalances.
In such conditions all freedoms are lost.
This, in more diplomatic language, is what Adlai Stevenson told the newspaper men of Latin America yesterday on behalf of the United States Government.
He felt able to end on a note of hope.
He sees evidence of fair winds for the ten-year Alliance for Progress plan with its emphasis on social reforms.
No group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editors and publishers of the Inter-*american Press Association.
Meeting in Moscow the Twenty-second Soviet Communist Party Congress opens in Moscow today in a situation contrasting sharply with the script prepared many months ago when this meeting was first announced.
According to the original program, Premier Khrushchev expected the millions looking toward the Kremlin this morning to be filled with admiration or rage -- depending upon individual or national politics -- because of the bold program for building communism in our time which the Congress will adopt.
But far from being concerned about whether or not Russia will have achieved Utopia by 1980, the world is watching Moscow today primarily for clues as to whether or not there will be nuclear Armageddon in the immediate future.
The evident contradiction between the rosy picture of Russia's progress painted by the Communist party's program and the enormous dangers for all humanity posed by Premier Khrushchev's Berlin policy has already led to speculation abroad that the program may be severely altered.
Whether it is or not, the propaganda impact on the free world of the document scheduled to be adopted at this meeting will be far less than had been originally anticipated.
And there must be many Soviet citizens who know what is going on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promised for 1980 they and their children must first survive.
This Congress will see Premier Khrushchev consolidating his power and laying the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove him from the scene in the next few years.
The widespread purge that has taken place the past twelve months or so among Communist leaders in the provinces gives assurance that the party officials who will dominate the Congress, and the Central Committee it will elect, will all have passed the tightest possible Khrushchev screening, both for loyalty to him and for competence and performance on the job.
Dr. Conant's call to action Dr. James B. Conant has earned a nationwide reputation as a moderate and unemotional school reformer.
His earlier reports considered the American public schools basically sound and not in need of drastic change.
Now, a close look at the schools in and around the ten largest cities, including New York, has shattered this optimism.
Dr. Conant has come away shocked and angry.
His new book, entitled Slums And Suburbs, calls for fast and drastic action to avert disaster.
There is room for disagreement concerning some of Dr. Conant's specific views.
His strong opposition to the transfer of Negro children to schools outside their own neighborhood, in the interest of integration, will be attacked by Negro leaders who have fought for, and achieved, this open or permissive enrollment.
Dr. Conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality.
His suggestion that the prestige colleges be made the training institutions for medical, law and graduate schools will run into strong opposition from these colleges themselves -- even though what he is recommending is already taking shape as a trend.
But these are side issues to a powerful central theme.
That theme cuts through hypocrisies, complacency and double-talk.
It labels the slums, especially the Negro slums, as dead-end streets for hundreds of thousands of youngsters.
The villains of the piece are those who deny job opportunities to these youngsters, and Dr. Conant accuses employers and labor unions alike.
The facts, he adds, are hidden from public view by squeamish objections to calling bad conditions by their right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the schools, regardless of the color of their students.
A call for action before it is too late has alarming implications when it comes from a man who, in his previous reports on the schools, cautioned so strongly against extreme measures.
These warnings must not be treated lightly.
Dr. Conant's conscientious, selfless efforts deserve the nation's gratitude.
He has served in positions of greater glamour, both at home and abroad ; but he may well be doing his greatest service with his straightforward report on the state of the public schools.
And now -- more junk mail a fascinating letter has just reached this desk from a correspondent who likes to receive so-called junk mail.
He was delighted to learn that the Post Office Department is now going to expand this service to deliver mail from Representatives in Congress to their constituents without the use of stamps, names, addresses or even zone numbers.
In accordance with legislation passed at the last session of Congress, each Representative is authorized to deliver to the Post Office in bulk newsletters, speeches and other literature to be dropped in every letter box in his district.
This means an added burden to innumerable postmen, who already are complaining of heavy loads and low pay, and it presumably means an increased postal deficit, but, our correspondent writes, think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privileged to receive on a regular basis.
Our creditors do not forget us letter writing is a dying art.
Occasional letters are sent by individuals to one another and many are written by companies to one another, but these are mostly typewritten.
Most mail these days consists of nothing that could truly be called a letter.
Old, tired, trembling the woman came to the cannery.
She had, she said, heard that the plant was closing.
It couldn't close, she said.
She had raised a calf, grown it beef-fat.
She had, with her own work-weary hands, put seeds in the ground, watched them sprout, bud, blossom, and get ready to bear.
She was ready to kill the beef, dress it out, and with vegetables from her garden was going to can soup, broth, hash, and stew against the winter.
She had done it last year, and the year before, and the year before that, and she, and her people were dependent upon these cans for food.
This did not happen in counties of North Georgia, where the rivers run and make rich the bottom land.
Nor in South Georgia, where the summer sun shines warmly and gives early life to the things growing in the flat fields.
This happened in Decatur, De*kalb County, not 10 miles from the heart of metropolitian Atlanta.
And now, the woman, tired and trembling, came here to the De*kalb County cannery.
Is it so the cannery is going to close?
O. N. Moss, 61, tall, grey as a possum, canning plant chief since 1946, didn't know what to say.
He did say she could get her beef and vegetables in cans this summer.
He did say he was out of cans, the No. 3's, but I requisitioned 22,000.
He said he had No. 2's enough to last two weeks more.
Threat of closing the cannery is a recent one.
A three-man committee has recommended to Commission Chairman Charles O. Emmerich that the De*kalb County cannery be closed.
Reason : the cannery loses $3,000 yearly.
But De*kalb citizens, those who use the facilities of the cannery, say the cannery is not supposed to make any money.
The cannery, said Mrs. Lewellyn Lundeen, an active booster of the cannery since its opening during the war and rationing years of 1941, to handle the victory garden produce, is a service to the taxpayer.
And one of the best services available to the people who try to raise and can meat, to plant, grow vegetables and put them up.
It helps those people who help themselves.
The county, though, seems more interested in those people who don't even try, those who sit and draw welfare checks and line up for surplus food.
A driver of a dairy truck, who begins work at 1 a.m. finishes before breakfast, then goes out and grows a garden, and who has used the cannery to save and feed a family of five, asked, what in the world will we do?
What in the world, echoed others, those come with the beans, potatoes, the tomatoes, will any of us do?
Moss, a man who knows how much the cannery helps the county, doesn't believe it will close.
But he is in the middle, an employe of De*kalb, but on the side of the people.
The young married people ; the old couples.
The dairy truck driver ; the old woman with the stew.
Don't ask me if I think the cannery helps, he said.
Sir, I know the cannery helps.
Most of us would be willing to admit that forgiveness comes hard.
When a person has thoughtlessly or deliberately caused us pain or hardship it is not always easy to say, just forget it.
There is one thing I know ; a person will never have spiritual poise and inner peace as long as the heart holds a grudge.
I know a man who held resentment against a neighbor for more than three decades.
Several years ago I was his pastor.
One night, at the close of the evening service, he came forward, left his resentment at the altar and gave his heart to God.
After almost everyone had gone he told me the simple story of how one of his neighbors had moved a fence a few feet over on his land.
We tried to settle this dispute, he said, but could never come to an agreement.
I settled it tonight, he continued.
I leave this church with a feeling that a great weight has been lifted off my heart, I have left my grudge at the altar and forgiven my neighbor.
Forgiveness is the door through which a person must pass to enter the Kingdom of God.
You cannot wear the banner of God and at the same time harbor envy, jealousy and grudges in your heart.
Henry Van Dyke said, forgive and forget if you can ; but forgive anyway.
Jesus made three things clear about forgiveness.
We must, first of all, be willing to forgive others before we can secure God's forgiveness.
For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you : but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive -- your trespasses.
Matthew 6 : 14-15.
It will do no good to seek God's forgiveness until we have forgiven those who have done us wrong.
Then, Jesus indicated that God's forgiveness is unlimited.
In the prayer Jesus taught his disciples to pray we find these words, forgive us our debts.
When a person meets God's requirements for the experience of forgiveness he is forgiven.
God's mercy and patience will last forever.
Forgiveness implies more than a person wanting his past sins covered by God's love.
It also implies that a man wants his future to be free from the mistakes of the past.
We want the past forgiven, but at the same time we must be willing for God to direct the future.
Finally, we must be willing to forgive others as many times as they sin against us.
Once Peter asked, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him?
Till seven times?
Jesus saith unto him, until seventy times seven.
Matthew 18 : 21-22.
Jesus not only taught forgiveness, He gave us an example of it on the cross.
With all the energy of his broken body he prayed, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.
Luke 34.
She's been in and out of my house for a dozen years now, although she's still a teen-ager who looks like a baby, she is getting married.
Her mother, now dead, was my good friend and when she came to tell us about her plans and to show off her ring I had a sobering wish to say something meaningful to her, something her mother would wish said.
For a while there was such shrill girlish commotion I couldn't have made myself heard if I'd had the equivalent of the message to Garcia.
But when some of the squeals had subsided and she had been through one of those sessions that are so indispensable to the young female -- six girls sprawled on one bed, drinking Cokes and giggling -- she came back to the kitchen to talk with me a minute.
How do you know you love somebody enough to get married?
She asked.
It was the oldest and toughest question young lovers have ever asked : how can you be sure?
Aren't you sure?
I asked, looking at her searchingly.
I wanted to grab her by the arm and beg her to wait, to consider, to know for certain because life is so long and marriage is so important.
But if she were just having a normal case of pre-nuptial jitters such a question might frighten her out of a really good marriage.
Besides, in all honesty, I don't know how you can be sure.
I don't know any secret recipe for certainty.
In the fevered, intoxicating, breathless state of being in love the usual signposts that guide you to lasting and satisfying relationships are sometimes obscured.
I knew of but one test and I threw it out to her for what it was worth.
Does he ever bore you?
I asked.
Bore me?
She was shocked.
Oh, no-o ] why, he's so darling and I mean, I went on ruthlessly, when he's not talking about you or himself or the wonders of love, is he interesting?
Does he care about things that matter to you?
Can you visualize being stranded with him on a desert island for years and years and still find him fascinating?
Because, honey, I thought silently, there are plenty of desert islands in every marriage -- long periods when you're hopelessly stranded, together.
And if you bore each other then, heaven help you.
She came back the other day to reassure me.
She has studied and observed and she is convinced that her young man is going to be endlessly enchanting.
She asked if I had other advice and, heady with success, I rushed it in, I hope not too late.
Be friends with your mother-in-law.
Jokes, cartoons and cynics to the contrary, mothers-in-law make good friends.
I do not know Dr. Wilson Sneed well.
But I was deeply moved by his letter of resignation as rector of St. Luke's Church in Atlanta.
It was the cry of not just one heart ; it spoke for many in the clergy, I suspect.
The pulpit is a lonely place.
Who stops to think of that?
Imagine the searching and the prayer that lay behind the letter the rector wrote after almost a decade of service to this majestic church.
Such a church needs vigor and vitality in its rector and one man has only so much of these endowments, he told his members.
A minister should not stay beyond the time that his leadership should benefit his church, he wrote, for he becomes ordinary.
And so the young minister resigned, to go and study and pray, having never passed a day, he told his parishioners, when I did not gain from you far more than I ever gave to you.
His very honest act called up the recent talk I had with another minister, a modest Methodist, who said : I feel so deeply blessed by God when I can give a message of love and comfort to other men, and I would have it no other way : and it is unworthy to think of self.
But oh, how I do sometimes need just a moment of rest, and peace, in myself.
A man who gives himself to God and to the believers of his church takes upon himself a life of giving.
He does not expect to get great riches or he would not have chosen to answer the call to preach.
The good ones are not motivated to seek vainly, nor are they disposed to covet comfort, or they would have been led to fields that offer comfort and feed vanity.
Theirs is a sacrificial life by earthly standards.
Yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from him and expect interpretation of the infinite through him -- we who readily accept his sacrifice as our due, we of the congregations are the first to tell him what is in our minds instead of listening to what is in his soul.
We press him to conform to our comfortable conceptions and not to bruise our satisfactions with his word, and God's.
We do not defeat the good ones with this cruelty, but we add to their burden, while expecting them to bestow saintliness upon us in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few bucks a week, American cash.
If we break the minister to our bit, we are buying back our own sins.
If he won't break, we add to the stress he bears.
And a minister of all men is most conscious that he is mere man -- prone to the stresses that earthly humanity is heir to.
We expect him to be noble, and to make us so -- yet he knows, and tries to tell us, how very humble man must be.
We expect bestowal of God's love through him.
But how little love we give him.
The church truly is not a rest home for saints, but a hospital for sinners.
Yet every Sunday we sinners go to that emergency room to receive first aid, and we leave unmindful that the man who ministered to us is a human being who suffers, too.
Mr. Podger always particularly enjoyed the last night of each summer at Loon Lake.
The narrow fringe of sadness that ran around it only emphasized the pleasure.
The evening was not always spent in the same way.
This year, on a night cool with the front of September moving in, but with plenty of summer still about, the Podgers were holding a neighborhood gathering in the Pod.
The little cottage was bursting with people of all ages.
In the midst of it all, Mr. Podger came out on the Pod porch, alone.
He had that day attended a country auction, and he had come back with a prize.
The prize was an old-fashioned, woven cloth hammock, complete with cross-top pillow, fringed side pieces, and hooks for hanging.
Mrs. Podger had obligingly pushed things around on the porch to make room for it, and there it was, slung in a vine-shaded corner, the night breeze rippling its fringe with a slow, caressing movement.
Mr. Podger sat down in it, pushed himself back and forth in one or two slow, rhythmic motions, and then swung his feet up into it.
He closed his eyes and let the unintelligible drift of voices sweep pleasantly over him.
Suddenly one young voice rose above the others.
But, it said, do you always know when you're happy?
The voice sank back into the general tangle of sound, but the question stayed in Mr. Podger's mind.
Here, in the cool, autumn-touched evening, Mr. Podger mentally retraced a day that had left him greatly contented and at peace.
It had begun with the blue jay feather.
Walking along the lake before breakfast, Mr. Podger had seen the feather, and the bird that had lost it in flight.
The winging spread of blue had gone on, calling harshly, into the wood.
The small shaft of blue had drifted down and come to rest at his feet.
All day long Mr. Podger, who was a straw-hat man in the summer, had worn the feather in the band of his broad-brimmed sunshield.
Would a blue feather in a man's hat make him happy all day?
Hardly.
But it was something to have seen it floating down through the early morning sunshine, linking the blue of the sky with the blue of the asters by the lake.
Then, since the auction was being held nearby, he had walked to it.
And there, on the way, had been the box turtle, that slow, self-contained, world-ignoring relic of pre-history, bent, for reasons best known to itself, on crossing the road.
It was doing very well, too, having reached the center, and was pursuing its way with commendable singleness of purpose when Mr. Podger saw hazard approaching in the shape of a flashy little sports car.
Would the driver see the turtle?
Would he take pains to avoid it?
Mr. Podger took no chances.
Taking off his hat and signaling the driver with it, Mr. Podger stepped into the road, lifted the surprised turtle and consummated its road-crossing with what must have been a breath-taking suddenness.
The turtle immediately withdrew into its private council room to study the phenomenon.
But Mr. Podger and the driver of the sports car waved at each other.
Here in the cool darkness Mr. Podger could still feel the warmth of midday, could still see the yellow butterflies dancing over the road, could still see the friendly grin on the young, sun-browned face as the driver looked back over his shoulder for a moment before the car streaked out of sight.
Where was the driver now?
What was he doing?
And the turtle?
Mr. Podger smiled.
For a few brief minutes they had all been part of one little drama.
The three would never meet again, but for some reason or other Mr. Podger was sure he would always remember the incident.
Then there had been the auction itself.
Mr. Podger heard again ; at will, the voice of the auctioneer, the voices of the bidders, and finally the small boy who had been so interested in Mr. Podger's hammock purchase.
I like them things, too, he had said.
We got one at home.
You know what?
If you're lyin' out in the hammock at night, and it gets kinda cool -- you know -- you just take these sides with the fringe on -- see -- and wrap 'em right over you.
I do it, lots o' times -- I like to lie in a hammock at night, by myself, when it's all quiet.
The wind moves it a little bit -- you know.
Mr. Podger had thanked him gravely, and now he made use of the advice.
As he pulled the fringed sides up and made himself into a cocoon, Mr. Podger saw that thin, attractive, freckled little face again, and hoped that the boy, too, was lying in a cool, fringed-wrapped quiet.
Alacrity, the Podger cat, came by the hammock, rubbed her back briefly against it, and then, sure of a welcome, hopped up.
She remarked that she found the night wind a little chilly, and Mr. Podger took her inside the fringe.
Soon her purring rivaled the chirping of the tree crickets, rivaled the hum of voices from inside the Pod.
Mr. Podger was just adding this to his pictures of the day when the screen door opened and Pam burst out.
Dad ] she said.
It's getting so chilly we've lighted a fire, and we're going to tell a round robin story -- a nice, scary one.
We need you to start it.
Why are you out here all by yourself?
Aren't you happy?
Mr. Podger opened his cocoon and emerged, tucking Alacrity under his arm to bring her in by the fire.
Of course I am, he said.
Never happier in my life.
I just came out here to know it.
Dallas as the South begins another school year, national and even world attention is directed at the region's slow progress toward racial equality in the public schools.
Desegregation is beginning in two more important Southern cities -- Dallas and Atlanta.
In each city civic and education leaders have been working hard to get public opinion prepared to accept the inevitability of equal treatment.
These programs emphasize the acceptance of biracial classrooms peacefully.
The programs do not take sides on the issue itself.
They point out simply that it is the law of the land.
The two cities have the examples of Little Rock and New Orleans to hold up as warnings against resorting to violence to try to stop the processes of desegregation.
Even better, they have the examples of Nashville and Houston to hold up as peaceful and progressive programs.
In each case there was an initial act of violence.
In Nashville, a school was dynamited.
In Houston, there were a few incidents of friction between whites and Negroes, none of which were serious.
In each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halted the threats of more serious incidents.
The Nashville plan, incidentally, has become recognized as perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the troubled South.
It is a stair-step plan, in which desegregation begins in the first grade.
Each year another grade is added to the process, until finally all 12 grades are integrated.
The schedules are flexible so that the program can be accelerated as the public becomes more tolerant or realizes that it is something that has to be done, so why not now.
The program has worked well in both Nashville and Houston.
It met a serious rebuff in New Orleans, where the two schools selected for the first moves toward integration were boycotted by white parents.
Another attempt will be made this year in New Orleans to resume the program.
Generally, throughout the South, there is a growing impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation is met.
Perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barriers has been in Dallas.
During the summer, Negroes began quietly patronizing previously segregated restaurants and lunch counters in downtown retail establishments.
It was part of a citywide move toward full integration.
So successful has been this program, worked out by white and Negro civic leaders, that further extensions are expected in the next few months.
Hotels, for example, are ready to let down the bars.
Already, at least one hotel has been quietly taking reservations on a nonracial basis.
Several conventions have been held in recent months in hotels on a nonsegregated basis.
This is a radical change in attitude from the conditions which prevailed several years ago, when a series of bombings was directed against Negroes who were moving into previously all-white neighborhoods of Dallas.
It is also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appears to be spreading all across the South.
Southern whites themselves are realizing that they had been wrong in using violence to try to stop Negroes from claiming equal rights.
They insist they are ashamed of such violence and intimidation as occurred in Alabama when the Freedom Riders sought to break down racial discrimination in local bus depots.
All across the South there are signs that racial violence is finding less approval among whites who themselves would never take active part but might once have shown a tolerant attitude toward it.
There are many causes for this change.
One of the most important is economic.
Business leaders are aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence.
They are putting strong pressure on their police departments to keep order.
In the past these same Southerners were inclined to look the other way.
And as the businessmen have begun to act, a real sense of co-operation has sprung up.
This co-operation has emboldened other Southern whites to add their voices to demands for peaceable accommodation.
They realize that by acting in concert, rather than individually, they will not be picked out as objects of retaliation -- economic and otherwise.
Since moving from a Chicago suburb to Southern California a few months ago, I've been introduced to a new game called Lanesmanship.
Played mostly on the freeways around Los Angeles, it goes like this : a driver cruising easily at 70 m.p.h. in Lane *j of a four-lane freeway spies an incipient traffic jam ahead.
Traffic in the next lane appears to be moving more smoothly so he pokes a tentative fender into Lane *j, which is heavily populated by cars also moving at 70 m.p.h..
The adjacent driver in Lane *j has three choices open to him.
He can ( 1 ) point his car resolutely at the invading fender and force the other driver back into Lane *j ; ( 2 ) slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lanes ; or ( 3 ) alternately accelerate and decelerate, thus keeping the first driver guessing as to his intentions, thereby making a fascinating sport of the whole affair.
The really remarkable thing to me is that most California natives unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invading car free access.
Whether or not this is done out of enlightened self-preservation, I don't know.
But it is done, consistently and I'm both surprised and impressed.
This could never happen in my native Chicago.
There such soggy acquiesence would be looked upon as a sure sign of deteriorating manhood.
In Chicago, the driver cut out would likely jam his gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back.
Failing this, he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake his fist threateningly.
This negative explanation of courtesy on the freeways, however, does an injustice to Southern California drivers.
At the risk of losing my charge-a-plate at Marshall Field and Company, I would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype.
After three months of research, I can state unequivocally that Los Angeles drivers are considerably more courteous and competent than any other drivers I've ever encountered.
During one recent day of driving about Los Angeles there were actually a dozen occasions when oncoming drivers stopped an entire lane of traffic to permit me to pull out of an impossible side street.
Miami, Fla., March 17.
An out-of-town writer came up to Paul Richards today and asked the Oriole manager if he thought his ball club would be improved this year.
Now Richards, of course, is known as a deep thinker as baseball managers go.
He can often make the complex ridiculously simple, and vice versa.
This happened to be vice versa, but even so, the answer was a masterpiece.
It's a whole lot easier, he said, to increase the population of Nevada, than it is to increase the population of New York city.
And with that he walked off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher.
That is undoubtedly a hell of a quote, said the writer, scratching his head.
Now, if I can just figure out what he's talking about, I'll use it.
Two spots open this was just Richard's way of saying that last year the Birds opened spring training with a lot of jobs wide open.
Some brilliant rookies nailed them down, so that this spring just two spots, left and right field, are really up for grabs.
It should be easier to plug two spots than it was to fill the wholesale lots that were open last year, but so far it hasn't worked that way.
This angle of just where the Orioles can look for improvement this year is an interesting one.
You'd never guess it from the way they've played so far this spring, but there remains a feeling among some around here that the Orioles still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961.
Obviously, if this club is going to move from second to first in the American League, it will have to show improvement someplace.
Where can that improvement possibly come from?
You certainly can't expect the infield to do any better than it did last year.
Robby could be better.
Brooks Robinson is great, and it is conceivable that he'll do even better in 1961 than he did in 1960.
You can't expect it, though.
Robby's performance last year was tremendous.
It's the same with Ron Hansen and Jim Gentile.
If they do as well as they did in 1960 there can be no complaint.
They shouldn't be asked to carry any more of the burden.
Hansen will be getting a late spring training start, which might very well set him back.
He got off to an exceptional start last season, and under the circumstances probably won't duplicate it.
There are some clubs which claim they learned something about pitching to him last year.
They don't expect to stop him, just slow him down some with the bat.
He'll still be a top player, they concede, because he's got a great glove and the long ball going for him.
But they expect to reduce his over-all offensive production.
Breeding might move up.
Gentile can hardly do better than drive in 98 runs.
Don't ask him more.
I have a hunch Marv Breeding might move up a notch.
But even so, he had a good year in 1960 and won't do too much better.
So, all in all, the infield can't be expected to supply the added improvement to propel the Birds from second to first.
And the pitching will also have trouble doing better.
Richards got a great performance out of his combination of youth and experience last season.
Where, then, can we look for improvement?
From Triandos, Brandt and Walker, answers Richards.
They're the ones we can expect to do better.
The man is right, and at this time, indications are that these three are ready for better seasons.
Triandos hasn't proved it yet, but he says he's convinced his thumb is all right.
He jammed it this spring and has had to rest it, but he says the old injury hasn't bothered him.
If he can bounce back with one of those 25 home runs years, the club will have to be better off offensively.
I'm still not convinced, though, I'll have to see more of him before predicting that big year for him.
Hank Foiles, backed up by Frank House who will be within calling distance in the minors, make up better second line catching than the Birds had all last year, but Gus is still that big man you need when you start talking pennant.
To me, Brandt looks as though he could be in for a fine year.
He hasn't played too much, because Richards has been working on him furiously in batting practice.
He's hitting the ball hard, in the batting cage, and his whole attitude is improved over this time last year.
When he came to Baltimore, he was leaving a team which was supposed to win the National League pennant, and he was joining what seemed to be a second division American League club.
He was down, hard to talk to, and far too nonchalant on the field.
As of now, that all seems behind him.
He's been entirely different all spring.
And Walker looks stronger, seems to be throwing better than he did last year.
Let him bounce back, and he could really set up the staff.
So, if the Orioles are to improve, Brandt, Triandos and Walker will have to do it.
So far the platoons on left and right fielders don't seem capable of carrying the load.
Of course, this isn't taking into consideration the population of Nevada and New York city, but it's the way things look from here at this point.
Is the mother of an autistic child at fault?
( the autistic child is one who seems to lack a well-defined sense of self.
He tends to treat himself and other people as if they were objects -- and sometimes he treats objects as if they were people.
) did his mother make him this way?
Some people believe she did.
We think differently.
We believe that autism, like so many other conditions of defect and deviation, is to a large extent inborn.
A mother can help a child adapt to his difficulties.
Sometimes she can -- to a large extent -- help him overcome them.
But we don't think she creates them.
We don't think she can make her child defective, emotionally disturbed or autistic.
The mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help her own child and often, by sharing her experiences, she can help other mothers with the same problem.
Since little is known about autism, and almost nothing has been written for the layman, we'd like to share one experienced mother's comments.
She wrote : total disinterest.
As the mother of an autistic child who is lacking in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything, I have to manipulate my son's fingers for him when he first plays with a new toy.
He wants me to do everything for him.
You don't believe that autistic children become autistic because of something that happens to them or because of the way their mother treats them.
But I do and my psychiatrist does, too.
I know that my son wants control and direction, but being autistic myself I cannot give full control or direction.
One thing I notice which I have seldom heard mentioned.
This is that autistic people don't enjoy physical contact with others -- for instance, my children and I.
When I hold my son he stiffens his whole body in my arms until he is as straight and stiff as a board.
He pushes and straightens himself as if he can't stand the feeling of being held.
Physical contact is uncomfortable for him ] this mother is quite correct.
As a rule, the autistic child doesn't enjoy physical contact with others.
Parents have to find other ways of comforting him.
For the young child this may be no more than providing food, light or movement.
As he grows older it may be a matter of providing some accustomed object ( his magic thing ).
Or certain words or rituals that child and adult go through may do the trick.
The answer is different for each autistic child, but for most there is an answer.
Only ingenuity will uncover it.
What future holds dear Doctors : we learned this year that our older son, Daniel, is autistic.
We did not accept the diagnosis at once, but gradually we are coming to.
Fortunately, there is a nursery school which he has been able to attend, with a group of normal children.
I try to treat Daniel as if he were normal, though of course I realize he is far from that at present.
What I do is to try to bring him into contact with reality as much as possible.
I try to give him as many normal experiences as possible.
What is your experience with autistic children?
How do they turn out later?
Many autistic children grow up to lead relatively normal lives.
Certainly, most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people, but many adjust to school, even college, to jobs and even to marriage and parenthood.
Single-color use question -- a first grader colors pictures one solid color, everything -- sky, grass, boy, wagon, etc..
When different colors are used, she is just as likely to color trees purple, hair green, etc..
The other children in the class use this same coloring book and do a fairly good job with things their proper color.
Should I show my daughter how things should be colored?
She is an aggressive, nervous child.
Is a relaxed home atmosphere enough to help her outgrow these traits?
Answer -- her choice of one color means she is simply enjoying the motor act of coloring, without having reached the point of selecting suitable colors for different objects.
This immature use of crayons may suggest that she is a little immature for the first grade.
No, coloring isn't exactly something you teach a child.
You sometimes give them a little demonstration, a little guidance, and suggestions about staying inside the lines.
But most learn to color and paint as and when they are ready with only a very little demonstration.
Seen in decorating circles of late is a renewed interest in an old art : embroidery.
Possibly responsible for this is the incoming trend toward multicolor schemes in rooms, which seems slated to replace the one-color look to which we have been accustomed.
Just as a varitinted Oriental rug may suggest the starting point for a room scheme, so may some of the newest versions of embroidery.
One such, in fact, is a rug.
Though not actually crewel embroidery, it has that look with its over-stitched raised pattern in blue, pink, bronze and gold and a sauterne background.
The twirled, stylized design of winding stems and floral forms strongly suggests the embroidered patterns used so extensively for upholstery during the Jacobean period in England.
Traditional crewel embroidery which seems to be appearing more frequently this fall than in the past few years is still available in this country.
The work is executed in England ( by hand ) and can be worked in any desired design and color.
Among some recent imports were seat covers for one series of dining room chairs on which were depicted salad plates overflowing with tomatoes and greens and another set on which a pineapple was worked in naturalistic color.
Chinese influence for a particularly fabulous room which houses a collection of fine English Chippendale furniture, fabric wall panels were embroidered with a typically Chinese-inspired design of this revered Eighteenth Century period.
Since the work is done by hand, the only limitation, it is said, is that of human conception.
Modern embroidered panels, framed and meant to be hung on the wall, are another aspect of this trend.
These have never gone out of style in Scandinavian homes and now seem to be reappearing here and there in shops which specialize in handicrafts.
An amateur decorator might try her hand at a pair during the long winter evenings, and, by picking up her living room color scheme, add a decorative do-it-yourself note to the room.
California Democrats this weekend will take the wraps off a 1962 model statewide campaign vehicle which they have been quietly assembling in a thousand district headquarters, party clubrooms and workers' backyards.
They seem darned proud of it.
And they're confident that the *j, currently assailed by dissensions within the ranks, will be impressed by the purring power beneath the hood of this grassroots-fueled machine.
Their meeting at San Francisco is nominally scheduled as a conference of the California Democratic Council directorate.
But it will include 200-odd officeholders, organization leaders and interested party people.
Out of this session may come : 1 -- plans for a dramatic, broad-scale party rally in Los Angeles next December that would enlist top-drawer Democrats from all over the country.
2 -- blueprints for doubling the *j present 55,000 enrollment.
3 -- arrangements for a statewide pre-primary endorsing convention in Fresno next Jan. 26-28.
4 -- and proposals for a whole series of lesser candidate-picking conventions in the state's 38 new Congressional districts.
At the head of the *j is an unorthodox, 39-year-old amateur politico, Thomas B. Carvey Jr., whose normal profession is helping develop Hughes Aircraft's moon missiles.
He's approached his Democratic duties in hard-nosed engineering fashion.
Viewed from afar, the *j looks like a rather stalwart political pyramid : its elected directorate fans out into an array of district leaders and standing committees, and thence into its component clubs and affiliated groups -- 500 or so.
Much of its strength stems from the comfortable knowledge that every volunteer Democratic organization of any consequence belongs to the *j.
Moreover, the entire state Democratic hierarchy, from Gov. Brown on down to the county chairmen, also participates in this huge operation.
Contrarily, Republican volunteers go their separate ways, and thus far have given no indication that they'd be willing to join forces under a single directorate, except in the most loose-knit fashion.
Carvey believes that reapportionment, which left many Democratic clubs split by these new district boundaries, actually will increase *j membership.
Where only one club existed before, he says, two will flourish henceforth.
Biggest organizational problem, he adds, is setting up *j units in rock-ribbed Democratic territory.
Paradoxically the council is weakest in areas that register 4- and 5-to-1 in the party's favor, strongest where Democrats and Republicans compete on a fairly even basis.
Like most Democratic spokesmen, Carvey predicts 1962 will be a tremendously partisan year.
Hence the attention they're lavishing on the *j.
In all probability, the council will screen and endorse candidates for the Assembly and for Congress, and then strive to put its full weight behind these pre-primary favorites.
This bodes heated contests in several districts where claims have already been staked out by Democratic hopefuls who don't see eye-to-eye with the *j.
Naturally, the statewide races will provide the major test for the expanding council.
Shunted aside by the rampant organizers for John F. Kennedy last year, who relegated it to a somewhat subordinate role in the Presidential campaign, the *j plainly intends to provide the party's campaign muscle in 1962.
There is evidence that it will be happily received by Gov. Brown and the other constitutional incumbents.
Carvey considers that former Vice President Nixon would be Brown's most formidable foe, with ex-*gov. Knight a close second.
But the rest of the *j gubernatorial aspirants don't worry him very much.
In his *j work, Carvey has the close-in support and advice of one of California's shrewdest political strategists : former Democratic National Committeeman Paul Ziffren, who backed him over a Northland candidate espoused by Atty. Gen. Stanley Mosk.
( significantly, bitter echoes of the 1960 power struggle that saw Mosk moving into the national committee post over Ziffren are still audible in party circles.
) note : we've just received an announcement of the 54th Assembly district post-reapportionment organizing convention Wednesday night in South Pasadena's War Memorial Bldg., which graphically illustrates the *j broad appeal.
State Sen. Dick Richards will keynote ; state and county committeemen, *j directors and representatives, members of 16 area clubs, and all residents have been invited.
This is going to be a language lesson, and you can master it in a few minutes.
It is a short course in Communese.
It works with English, Russian, German, Hungarian or almost any other foreign tongue.
Once you learn how to translate Communese, much of each day's deluge of news will become clearer.
At least, I have found it so.
For some compulsive reason which would have fascinated Dr. Freud, Communists of all shapes and sizes almost invariably impute to others the very motives which they harbor themselves.
They accuse their enemies of precisely the crimes of which they themselves are most guilty.
President Kennedy's latest warning to the Communist world that the United States will build up its military strength to meet any challenge in Berlin or elsewhere was, somewhat surprisingly, reported in full text or fairly accurate excerpts behind the Iron Curtain.
Then the Communese reply came back from many mouthpieces with striking consistency.
Now listen closely : Moscow radio from the Literary Gazette in English to England : President Kennedy once again interpreted the Soviet proposals, to sign a peace treaty with Germany as a threat, as part of the world menace allegedly looming over the countries of capitalism.
Evidently the war drum beating and hysteria so painstakingly being stirred up in the West have been planned long in advance.
The West Berlin crisis is being played up artificially because it is needed by the United States to justify its arms drive.
The Soviet news agency *j datelined from New York in English to Europe : President Kennedy's enlargement of the American military program was welcomed on Wall Street as a stimulus to the American munitions industry.
When the stock exchange opened this morning, many dealers were quick to purchase shares in Douglas, Lockheed and United Aircraft and prices rose substantially.
Over 4 million shares were sold, the highest figures since early June.
( quotations follow.
) *j datelined Los Angeles, in English to Europe : former Vice President Nixon came out in support of President Kennedy's program for stepping up the arms race.
He also demanded that Kennedy take additional measures to increase international tension : specifically to crush the Cuban revolution, resume nuclear testing, resist more vigorously admission of China to its lawful seat in the United Nations, and postpone non-military programs at home.
T*a*s*s from Moscow in English to Europe : the American press clamored for many days promising President Kennedy would reply to the most vital domestic and foreign problems confronting the United States.
In fact, the world heard nothing but sabre-rattling, the same exercises which proved futile for the predecessors of the current President.
If there were no West Berlin problem, imperialist quarters would have invented an excuse for stepping up the armaments race to try to solve the internal and external problems besetting the United States and its *j partners.
Washington apparently decided to use an old formula, by injecting large military appropriations to speed the slow revival of the U.*s. economy after a prolonged slump.
And now, for Communist listeners and readers : Moscow Radio in Russian to the *j : the U.*s. President has shown once again that the United States needs the fanning of the West Berlin crisis to justify the armaments race.
As was to be expected Kennedy's latest speech was greeted with enthusiasm by revenge-seeking circles in Bonn, where officials of the West German government praised it.
Moscow Novosti article in Russian, datelined London : U.*s. pressure on Britain to foster war hysteria over the status of West Berlin has reached its apogee.
British common sense is proverbial.
The present attempts of the politicians to contaminate ordinary Britons shows that this British common sense is unwilling to pull somebody else's chestnuts out of the fire by new military adventures.
East Berlin ( Communist ) radio in German to Germany : a better position for negotiations is the real point of this speech.
Kennedy knows the West will not wage war for West Berlin, neither conventional nor nuclear, and negotiations will come as certainly as the peace treaty.
Whenever some Washington circles were really ready for talks to eliminate friction they have always succumbed to pressure from the war clique in the Pentagon and in Bonn.
In Kennedy's speech are cross currents, sensible ones and senseless ones, reflecting the great struggle of opinions between the President's advisers and the political and economic forces behind them.
Well, dear listeners, despite all the shouting, there will be no war over West Berlin.
Moscow *j in Russian datelined Sochi : Chairman Khrushchev received the U.*s. President's disarmament adviser, John Mc*cloy.
Their conversation and dinner passed in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
Now, to translate from the Communese, this means : the West Berlin crisis is really an East Berlin crisis.
The crisis was artificially stirred up by the Kremlin ( Wall Street ) and the Red Army ( Pentagon ) egged on by the West Germans ( East Germans ).
The reason was to speed up domestic production in the *j, which Khrushchev promised upon grabbing power, and try to end the permanent recession in Russian living standards.
Chairman Khrushchev ( Kennedy ) rattles his rockets ( sabre ) in order to cure his internal ills and to strengthen his negotiating position.
His advisers in the Politburo ( White House ) are engaged in a great struggle of opinions, so he is not always consistent.
The Soviet Union will fight neither a conventional nor a nuclear war over Berlin, and neither will its Warsaw Pact allies.
The West has no intention of attacking Russia.
Chairman Khrushchev and John Mc*cloy had a terrible row at Sochi.
See, Communese is easy -- once you get onto it.
Aug. 4, 1821, nearly a century after Benjamin Franklin founded the Pennsylvania Gazette -- a century during which it had undergone several changes in ownership and a few brief suspensions in publication -- this paper made its first appearance as the Saturday Evening Post.
The country was now full of Gazettes and Samuel C. Atkinson and Charles Alexander, who had just taken over Franklin's old paper, desired a more distinctive name.
When founded by Franklin the Gazette was a weekly family newspaper and under its new name its format remained that of a newspaper but its columns gradually contained more and more fiction, poetry, and literary essays.
In the middle of the century, with a circulation of 90,000, the Post was one of the most popular weeklies in the country.
But during the second half of the century its fortunes reached a low point and when in 1897 Cyrus H. K. Curtis purchased it -- paper, type, and all -- for $1,000 it was a 16-page weekly filled with unsigned fiction and initialed miscellany, and with only some 2,000 subscribers.
Little more than a fine old name, valuable principally because of the Franklin tradition, the Saturday Evening Post was slow to revive.
But Curtis poured over $1 million into it and in time it again became one of the most popular weeklies of the country.

Inmates might even demand the 34-hour week, all holidays off and fringe benefits including state contributions toward lawyers' fees.
Some day we might see a Federation of Prison and Jail Inmates, with a leader busily trying to organize reformatory occupants, defendants out on bail, convicts opposed to probation officers, etc..
A three-day confinement week, with a month's vacation and shorter hours all around could be an ultimate demand from cell occupants of the nation, with fringe benefits including : 1.
Wider space between iron bars and agreement by prison boards to substitute rubber in 20 per cent of metal.
2.
An agreement allowing convicts to pass on type of locks used on prison doors.
In case of a deadlock between prison boards and inmates, a federal arbitration board to include a lifer and two escapees should decide the issue.
3.
Specific broadening of travel rights.
4.
The right to leave the hoosegow any time to see a lawyer instead of waiting for a lawyer to make a trip to the prison.
5.
Recognition of Prisoners Union rule that no member of an iron or steel workers union be permitted to repair a sawed-off bar without approval and participation of representative of the cell occupant.
6.
No warden or guard to touch lock, key or doorknob except when accompanied by a prisoners' committee with powers of veto.
7.
State and federal approval of right to walk out at any time when so voted by 51 per cent of the prisoners.
The death of Harold A. Stevens, oldest of the Stevens brothers, famed operators of baseball, football and race track concessions, revived again the story of one of the greatest business successes in history.
Harold, with brothers Frank, Joe and William, took over at the death of their father, Harry M. Stevens, who put a few dollars into a baseball program, introduced the hot dog and paved the way for creation of a catering empire.

Washington -- Rep. Frelinghuysen, *j Dist., had a special reason for attending the reception at the Korean Embassy for Gen. Chung Hee Park, the new leader of South Korea.
Not only is Mr. Frelinghuysen a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, but he is the grandson of the man who was instrumental in opening relations between the United States and Korea, Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, Secretary of State in the administration of Chester A. Arthur.
In addition Rep. Frelinghuysen's brother Harry was on the Korean desk of the State Department in World War 2.
Next year is the 80th anniversary of the signing of the treaty between Korea and the United States and experts in Seoul are trying to find the correspondence between Frederick Frelinghuysen, who was Secretary of State in 1883 and 1884, and Gen. Lucius Foote, who was the first minister to Korea.

In addition, he said, he has answered more than 400 messages of congratulations which led him to the comment that he himself had decided he wouldn't send another congratulatory message for the rest of his life.

Kind Mr. Sam among the many stories about the late Speaker Rayburn is one from Rep. Dwyer, *j Dist..
Mrs. Dwyer's husband, M. Joseph Dwyer, was taking a 10-year-old boy from Union County on the tour of the Capitol during the final weeks of the last session.
They ran across Mr. Rayburn and the youngster expressed a desire to get the Speaker's autograph.
Mr. Dwyer said that although it was obvious that Mr. Rayburn was not well he stopped, gave the youngster his autograph, asked where he was from and expressed the hope that he would enjoy his visit to Congress.
Two days later Mr. Rayburn left Washington for the last time.
The 350th anniversary of the King James Bible is being celebrated simultaneously with the publishing today of the New Testament, the first part of the New English Bible, undertaken as a new translation of the Scriptures into contemporary English.
Since it was issued in the spring of 1611, the King James Version has been most generally considered the most poetic and beautiful of all translations of the Bible.
However, Biblical scholars frequently attested to its numerous inaccuracies, as old manuscripts were uncovered and scholarship advanced.
This resulted in revisions of the King James Bible in 1881-85 as the English Revised Version and in 1901 as the American Standard Version.
Then in 1937 America's International Council of Religious Education authorized a new revision, in the light of expanded knowledge of ancient manuscripts and languages.
Undertaken by 32 American scholars, under the chairmanship of Rev. Dr. Luther A. Weigle, former dean of Yale University Divinity School, their studies resulted in the publishing of the Revised Standard Version, 1946-52.
Not rival the New English Bible ( the Old Testament and Apocrypha will be published at a future date ) has not been planned to rival or replace the King James Version, but, as its cover states, it is offered simply as the Bible to all those who will use it in reading, teaching, or worship.
Time, of course will testify whether the new version will have achieved its purpose.
Bible reading, even more so than good classical music, grows in depth and meaning upon repetition.
If this new Bible does not increase in significance by repeated readings throughout the years, it will not survive the ages as has the King James Version.
However, an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passages with the same parts of other versions seems to speak well of the efforts of the British Biblical scholars.
One is impressed with the dignity, clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary English, and there is no doubt that the meaning of the Bible is more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic words and phrases of the King James.
For example, in the third chapter of Matthew, verses 13-16, describing the baptism of Jesus, the 1611 version reads : then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.
But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
And Jesus answering said unto him, suffer it to be so now : for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.
Then he suffered him.
And Jesus, when he was baptized went up straightway out of the water : and lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.
Clearer meaning certainly, the meaning is clearer to one who is not familiar with Biblical teachings, in the New English Bible which reads : then Jesus arrived at Jordan from Galilee, and he came to John to be baptized by him.
John tried to dissuade him.
Do you come to me?
He said ; I need rather to be baptized by you.
Jesus replied, let it be so for the present ; we do well to conform this way with all that God requires.
John then allowed him to come.
After baptism Jesus came up out of the water at once, and at that moment heaven opened ; he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove to alight upon him ; ( the paragraphing, spelling and punctuation are reproduced as printed in each version.
) among the most frequently quoted Biblical sentences are the Beatitudes and yet so few persons, other than scholars, really understand the true meaning of these eight blessings uttered by Jesus at the beginning of the Sermon on the Mount.
To illustrate, the first blessing in the King James Bible reads : blessed are the poor in spirit ; for their's is the kingdom of heaven.
The new version states : how blest are those who know that they are poor ; the kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
Some of the poetic cadence of the older version certainly is lost in the newer one, but almost anyone, with a fair knowledge of the English language, can understand the meaning, without the necessity of interpretation by a Biblical scholar.
To a novice that is significant.
In the second and third chapters of Revelation the new version retains, however, the old phrase angel of the church which Biblical scholars have previously interpreted as meaning bishop.
This is not contemporary English.
Mostly contemporary for the most part, however, the new version is contemporary and, as such, should be the means for many to attain a clearer comprehension of the meaning of those words recorded so many hundreds of years ago by the first followers of Christ.
Originally recorded by hand, these words have been copied and recopied, translated and retranslated through the ages.
Discoveries recently made of old Biblical manuscripts in Hebrew and Greek and other ancient writings, some by the early church fathers, in themselves called for a restudy of the Bible.
To have the results recorded in everyday usable English should be of benefit to all who seek the truth.
There is one danger, however.
With contemporary English changing with the rapidity that marks this jet age, some of the words and phrases of the new version may themselves soon become archaic.
The only answer will be continuous study.
The New Testament offered to the public today is the first result of the work of a joint committee made up of representatives of the Church of England, Church of Scotland, Methodist Church, Congregational Union, Baptist Union, Presbyterian Church of England, Churches in Wales, Churches in Ireland, Society of Friends, British and Foreign Bible Society and National Society of Scotland.
Prof. C. H. Dodd, 76, a Congregational minister and a leading authority on the New Testament, is general director of the project and chairman of the New Testament panel.
Sizzling temperatures and hot summer pavements are anything but kind to the feet.
That is why it is important to invest in comfortable, airy types of shoes.
There are many soft and light shoe leathers available.
Many styles have perforations and an almost weightlessness achieved via unlined leathers.
Softness is found in crushed textures.
Styles run the gamut from slender and tapered with elongated toes to a newer squared toe shape.
Heels place emphasis on the long legged silhouette.
Wine glass heels are to be found in both high and semi-heights.
Stacked heels are also popular on dressy or tailored shoes.
Just the barest suggestion of a heel is found on teenage pumps.
Coolest shade while white is the coolest summer shade, there are lots of pastel hues along with tintable fabrics that will blend with any wardrobe color.
In the tintable group are high and little heels, squared and oval throats, and shantung-like textures.
Don't overlook the straws this year.
They come in crisp basket weaves in natural honey hues, along with lacey open weaves with a lustre finish in natural, white, black and a whole range of colors.
In the casual field straws feature wedge heels of cork or carved wood in a variety of styles.
For added comfort some of the Italian designed sandals have foam padded cushioning.
The citrus tones popular in clothing are also to be found afoot.
Orange and lemon are considered important as are such pastels as blue and lilac.
In a brighter nautical vein is Ille De France blue.
Contrast trim provides other touches of color.
Spectators in white crush textures dip toe and heel in smooth black, navy and taffy tan.
Designed for ease designed for summer comfort are the shoes illustrated.
At the left is a pair of dressy straw pumps in a light, but crisp texture.
In a lacey open weave shoes have a luster finish, braided collar and bow highlight on the squared throat.
At right is a casual style in a crushed unlined white leather.
Flats have a scalloped throat.
An electric toothbrush ( Broxodent ) may soon take its place next to the electric razor in the American bathroom.
The brush moves up and down and is small enough to clean every dental surface, including the back of the teeth.
In addition, the motor has the seal of approval of the Underwriters Laboratories, which means it is safe.
The unit consists of a small motor that goes on as soon as it is plugged in.
The speed is controlled by pressing on the two brake buttons located where the index finger and thumb are placed when holding the motor.
The brushes can be cleaned and sterilized by boiling and are detachable so that every member of the family can have his own.
Most of us brush our teeth by hand.
The same can be said of shaving yet the electric razor has proved useful to many men.
The electric toothbrush moves in a vertical direction, the way dentists recommend.
In addition, it is small enough to get into crevices, jacket and crown margins, malposed anteriors, and the back teeth.
The bristles are soft enough to massage the gums and not scratch the enamel.
It is conceivable that Broxodent could do a better job than ordinary brushing, especially in those who do not brush their teeth properly.
Several dentists and patients with special dental problems have experimented with the device.
The results were good although they are difficult to compare with hand brushing, particularly when the individual knows how to brush his teeth properly.
The electric gadget is most helpful when there are many crowned teeth and in individuals who are elderly, bedfast with a chronic disease, or are handicapped by disorders such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.
But for many of us, it will prove an enjoyable luxury.
It is not as convenient as the old type toothbrush and the paste tends to shimmy off the bristles.
Since the apparatus is new, it requires experimentation and changes in technique.
Turn over writes : does numbness in the left hand at night, which awakens the person, indicate brain tumor?
Reply : no.
This is a common symptom and the cause usually is pressure on the nerve leading to the affected hand.
The pressure may come from muscles, tendons, or bones anywhere from the neck to the hand.
Steam baths writes : do steam baths have any health value?
Reply : no, other than cleaning out the pores and making the sweat glands work harder.
An ordinary hot bath or shower will do the same.
Sewing brings numbness writes : what makes my hands numb when sewing?
Reply : there are many possibilities, including poor circulation, a variety of neurological conditions, and functional disorders.
This manifestation may be an early sign of multiple sclerosis or the beginning of sewer's cramp.
Brace for sciatica writes : does a brace help in sciatica?
Reply : a back brace might help, depending upon the cause of sciatica.
Cholesterol and thyroid writes : does the cholesterol go down when most of the thyroid gland is removed?
Reply : no.
It usually goes up.
The cholesterol level in the blood is influenced by the glands of the body.
It is low when the thyroid is overactive and high when the gland is sluggish.
The latter is likely to occur when the thyroid is removed.
The gap between the bookshelf and the record cabinet grows smaller with each new recording catalogue.
There's more reading and instruction to be heard on discs than ever before, although the spoken rather than the sung word is as old as Thomas Alva Edison's first experiment in recorded sound.
Edison could hardly have guessed, however, that Sophocles would one day appear in stereo.
If the record buyer's tastes are somewhat eclectic or even the slightest bit esoteric, he will find them satisfied on educational records.
And he will avoid eye-strain in the process.
Everything from poetry to phonetics, history to histrionics, philosophy to party games has been adapted to the turntable.
For sheer ambition, take the Decca series titled modestly Wisdom.
Volumes One and Two, selected from the sound tracks of a television series, contain conversations with the elder wise men of our day.
These sages include poet Carl Sandburg, statesman Jawaharlal Nehru and sculptor Jacques Lipchitz, in Volume One, and playwright Sean O'*casey, David Ben-*gurion, philosopher Bertrand Russell and the late Frank Lloyd Wright in the second set.
Hugh Downs is heard interviewing Wright, for an added prestige fillip.
There's more specialization and a narrower purpose in two albums recently issued by Dover Publications.
Dover publishes what the company calls Listen And Learn Productions designed to teach foreign languages.
Previous presentations have been on French, Spanish, Russian, Italian, German and Japanese.
But the firm has recognized the tight dollar and the tourist's desire to visit the smaller, less-traveled and relatively inexpensive countries, and is now prepared to teach modern Greek and Portuguese through recordings.
The respective vocabularies essential for travel are available in separate albums.
Thanks to Spoken Arts Records, history buffs may hear Lincoln's most memorable speeches and letters in a two-disc set, interpreted by Lincoln authority and lecturer Roy P. Basler.
As a contemporary bonus, the set includes Carl Sandburg's address at a joint session of Congress, delivered on Lincoln's birthday two years ago.
For those who like poetry but never get around to reading it, the Library of Congress makes it possible for poets to be heard reading their own work.
The program was instituted in 1940, and releases are available only from the Recording Laboratory of the Library of Congress, Washington 25, D.*c..
A catalogue is available on request.
Newest on the list are John Ciardi, W. D. Snodgrass, I. A. Richards, Oscar Williams, Robert Hillyer, John Hall Wheelock, Stephen Vincent Benet, Edwin Muir, John Peal Bishop and Maxwell Bodenheim.
Two poets are paired on each record, in the order given above.
Decca is not the only large commercial company to impart instruction.
R*c*a Victor has an ambitious and useful project in a stereo series called Adventures In Music, which is an instructional record library for elementary schools.
Howard Mitchell and the National Symphony perform in the first two releases, designed for grades one and two.
Teaching guides are included with each record.
In an effort to fortify himself against the unforseen upsets sure to arise in the future, Herbert A. Leggett, banker-editor of the Phoenix Arizona Progress, reflects upon a few of the depressing experiences of the feverish fifties.
One of the roughest was the *j quiz shows, which gave him inferiority complexes.
Though it was a great relief when the big brains on these shows turned out to be frauds and phonies, it did irreparable damage to the ego of the editor and many another intelligent, well-informed American.
But the one that upset the financially wise was the professional dancer who related in a book how he parlayed his earnings into a $2,000,000 profit on the stock market.
Every man who dabbles in the market to make a little easy money on the side and suffers losses could at the time hardly face his wife who was wondering how her husband could be so dumb.
Investors breathed more freely when it was learned that this acrobatic dancer had turned magician and was only doing a best seller book to make some dough.
People who take us for suckers are like the Westerner who had on exhibit his superior marksmanship in the form of a number of bull's-eye achievements.
The promoter who wanted to sign him up for the circus asked him how he was able to do it.
His answer was simple but honest.
He just shot at the board and then drew circles around the holes to form a bull's-eye.
One of the obstacles to the easy control of a 2-year-old child is a lack of verbal communication.
The child understands no.
He senses his mother's disapproval.
But explanations leave him confused and unmoved.
If his mother loves him, he clings to that love as a ballast.
It motivates his behavior.
He wants Mommy to think him a good boy.
He doesn't want her to look frowningly at him, or speak to him angrily.
This breaks his heart.
He wants to be called sweet, good, considerate and mother's little helper.
But even mother's loving attitude will not always prevent misbehavior.
His desires are so strong that he needs constant reassurance of his mother's love for him and what she expects of him, in order to overcome them.
His own inner voice, which should tell him what not to do, has not developed.
It won't develop until he has words with which to clothe it.
The conscience is non-existent in the 2-year-old.
What can a mother do then to prevent misbehavior?
She can decrease the number of temptations.
She can remove all knick-knacks within reach.
The fewer nos she has to utter the more effective they will be.
She should offer substitutes for the temptations which seem overwhelmingly desirable to the child.
If he can't play with Mommy's magazines, he should have some old numbers of his own.
If Daddy's books are out of bounds his own picture books are not.
Toys he has can be made to act as substitutes for family temptations such as refrigerator and gas stove.
During this precarious period of development the mother should continue to influence the growth of the child's conscience.
She tells him of the consequences of his behavior.
If he bites a playmate she says, Danny won't like you.
If he snatches a toy, she says, Caroline wants her own truck just as you do.
There is no use trying to Explain to a 2-year-old.
Actions speak louder.
Remove temptations.
Remove the child from the scene of his misbehavior.
Substitute approved objects for forbidden ones and keep telling him how he is to act.
He won't submit to his natural desires all the time, and it's Mother's love that is responsible for his good behavior.
This is the period during the melancholy days of autumn when universities and colleges schedule what they call Homecoming Day.
They seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scenes.
The football opponent on homecoming is, of course, selected with the view that said opponent will have little more chance than did a Christian when thrown to one of the emperor's lions.
It is true, of course, the uncertainties of life being what they are, that as now and then the Christian killed the lion, homecoming days have been ruined by a visiting team.
Even with all possible precaution, homecomings are usually rather cruel and sad, and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic are made happy by them.
More often than not, as the Old Grad wanders along the old paths, his memory of happy days when he strolled one of the paths with a coed beside him becomes an ache and a pain.
He can smell again the perfume she wore and recall the lilting sound of laughter, and can smell again the aroma of autumn -- fallen leaves, the wine of cool air, and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blows through all the winds of fall.
Undergraduates it is at precisely such moments that he encounters a couple of undergraduates, faces alight, holding hands and talking happily as they come along, oblivious of him, or throwing him the most fleeting and casual of glances, such as they would give a tethered goat.
Usually, they titter loudly after they have passed by.
His dream goes.
He feels, suddenly, the weight of the fat that is on him.
His bridgework or his plates feel loose and monstrous.
His bifocals blur.
His legs suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary, as if he had walked for miles, instead of strolling a few hundred yards along the old campus paths.
Bitterness comes over him and the taste of time is like unripe persimmons in his mouth.
It is not much better if he meets with old classmates.
Too often, unless he hails them, they pass him by.
He recalls with a wry smile the wit who said, on returning from a homecoming reunion, that he would never go again because all his class had changed so much they didn't even recognize him.
If they do meet and recognize one another, slap backs and embrace, the moment soon is done.
After all, when one has asked whatever became of old Joe and Charlie when one has inquired who it was Sue Brown married and where it is they now live when questions are asked and answered about families and children, and old professors when the game and its probable outcome has been exhausted that does it.
Middle-aged spread by then one begins to notice the middle-age spread ; the gray hairs, the eyeglasses, bodies that are too thin or too heavy ; the fading signs of old beauty ; the athlete of by-gone years who wears a size 46 suit and puffs when he has finished a sentence of any length then, it is time to break it up and move on.
It is, if anything, worse on the old player he sits in the stands and he doesn't like that.
Enough of his life was spent there on the field for him never to like watching the game as a spectator in the crowd.
He always feels lonely.
A team feels something.
On a team a man feels he is a part of it and akin to the men next to him.
In the stands he is lonely and lost, no matter how many are about him.
He sits there remembering the tense moment before the ball was snapped ; the churning of straining feet, the rasp of the canvas pants ; the smell and feel of hot, wet woolen sleeves across his face.
He remembers the desperate, panting breath ; the long runs on the kick-offs ; the hard, jolting tackles ; the breakthrough ; the desperate agony of goal-line stands.
And so, he squirms with each play, remembering his youth.
But it is no use.
It is gone.
No matter how often a man goes back to the scenes of his youth and strength, they can never be recaptured again.
Since the obvious is not always true, the Republican National Committee wisely analyzed its defeat of last autumn and finds that it occurred, as suspected, in the larger cities.
Of 40 cities with populations of 300,000 and more, Mr. Kennedy carried 26 and Mr. Nixon 14.
There are eight states in which the largest urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election.
These are New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Illinois and Minnesota.
In 1952 Mr. Eisenhower won all but Missouri.
Yet, in 1960 all eight gave majorities to Mr. Kennedy.
Republican research broke down the vote in Philadelphia.
Mr. Nixon, despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority groups, failed to do so.
His visit to Warsaw, Poland, after the Russian journey in the summer of 1959 was expected to win the Polish vote which, in several cities, is substantial.
Yet, the *j breakdown discovered that in Philadelphia Mr. Nixon received but 21 per cent of the so-called Polish vote ; 30 per cent of the Irish vote, and 18 per cent of the Negro vote.
Task force a *j task force committee will seek to find out how its party may win support from the ethnic and minority groups in cities.
The task force might make a start in Washington with Republican congressional leaders.
These gentlemen already have done the party harm by their seeming reluctance to vote aid for the depressed areas and by their criticism of Mr. Kennedy for talking about a recession and unemployment.
This error was compounded by declaring the recession to be a statistical one, and not a reality.
The almost six million persons without jobs and the two million working part-time do not consider themselves and their plight as statistical.
They did not view the tour of the distressed cities and towns by Secretary of Labor Goldberg as politics, which the *j declared it to be.
The people visited were glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in their misery.
Senator Mundt's gross distortion of President Eisenhower's conversation into a denunciation of President Kennedy as too left wing, a statement Mr. Eisenhower declared to be entirely false, is another case in point.
If the Republicans and Southern Democrats join to defeat medical care for the old under the Social Security program, they will thereby erect still another barrier to *j hopes in the cities.
Errors repeated the present Republican leadership as practiced by Mundt, Goldwater, Bridges, Dirksen, et al, is repeating the errors of the party leadership of the 1930s.
In that decade the partisan zeal to defend Mr. Hoover, and the party's failure to anticipate or cope with the depression, caused a great majority of Americans to see the Republican party as cold and lacking in any sympathy for the problems of human beings caught up in the distress and suffering brought on by the economic crash.
The Republican party was not lacking in humanity, but it permitted its extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble.
Farmers called their mule-drawn pickup trucks Hoover carts.
Smokers reduced to the makings, spoke of the sack tobacco as Hoover dust.
One may be sure the present Republican congressional leadership hasn't meant to repeat this error.
But it is in the process of so doing because it apparently gives priority to trying to downgrade John F. Kennedy.
That this is not good politics is underscored by the latest poll figures which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new President is conducting the nation's business.
The most articulate Republicans are those who, in their desire to get back at Mr. Kennedy, already have created the image of a Republican leadership which is reluctant to assist the distressed and the unemployed, and which is even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care.
If they also defeat the school bill, the *j task force won't have much research to do.
It will early know why the party won't win back city votes.
The 1962 General Assembly has important business to consider.
The tragedy is that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner.
After the Griffin-*byrd political troup has completed the circuit in November in the name of a Pre-*legislative Forum, this is going to be the most politically oriented Legislature in history.
Every legislator from Brasstown Bald to Folkston is going to have his every vote subjected to the closest scrutiny as a test of his political allegiances, not his convictions.
Hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stands less chance than ever.
And just how far can the Legislature go toward setting up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor's race?
How unpartisan will be the recommendations of Lt. Gov. Garland Byrd's Senate Committee on Government Operations?
The situation already was bad because the Legislature moved the governor's race forward a few months, causing the campaigning to get started earlier than usual.
But when former Gov. Marvin Griffin and Lt. Gov. Byrd accepted the invitations of the Georgia State Chamber of Commerce to join the tour next November, the situation was aggravated.
Neither had a choice other than to accept the invitation.
To have refused would have been political suicide.
And it may be that one or both men actually welcomed the opportunity, when the bravado comments are cast aside.
The Georgia State Chamber of Commerce tried to guard against the danger of eliminating potential candidates.
It wanted the State Democratic Executive Committee to pick the serious candidates.
But State Party Chairman James Gray of Albany said no, and he didn't mince any words.
They are just asking too much, he said.
We can't think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidates from other candidates, either.
There are other dangers : politics is an accelerating game.
If an opponent accuses you of lying, don't deny it.
Say he is a horse thief, runs an old adage.
These men are spenders.
If either one ever started making promises, there is no telling where the promises would end.
Griffin's Rural Roads Authority and Byrd's 60,000 miles of county contracts would look like pauper's oaths.
The trouble is that at first glance the idea looks like such a good one.
Why not have them travel the state in November debating?
It would present a forum for them in almost every community.
But further thought brings the shuddery visions of a governor's race being run in the next Legislature, the spectre of big spending programs, the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin.
There is a way out of this.
The Chamber has not arranged a pre-legislative forum.
It has arranged a campaign for governor.
If it will simply delay the debates until the qualifications are closed next spring, and then carry all the candidates on a tour of debates, it can provide a service to the state.
But the Legislature should be granted the opportunity to complete its work before choosing up sides for the race.
Former British Prime Minister Attlee says Eisenhower was not a great soldier.
Ike's somewhat like George Washington.
Both won a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from British strategy.
Congressmen returning from recess say the people admire President Kennedy so much, they're even willing to heed his call to sacrifice -- and give up his program.
Slogan of the John Birch Society : paddle your own canoe.
The guy who makes the motor boats may be a Communist.
A Republican survey says Kennedy won the '60 election on the religious issue.
Too many people were afraid if the *j won, they'd have to spend all their time praying.
The Providence Journal editorial ( Jan. 25 ) entitled East Greenwich Faces A Housing Development Problem points to a dilemma that faces communities such as ours.
Your suggested solution, it seems to me, is grossly oversimplified and is inconsistent with your generally realistic attitude toward, and endorsement of, sound planning.
First of all there is ample area in East Greenwich already zoned in the classification similar to that which petitioner requested.
This land is in various stages of development in several locations throughout the town.
The demand for these lots can be met for some time to come.
This would seem to indicate that we are trying neither to halt an influx of migrants nor are we setting up such standards for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new sites.
What we are attempting to do is achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential areas and industrial and commercial development.
It is in fact entirely consistent with your suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental costs.
Bostitch, Inc. is approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of their real estate tax.
The wisdom of granting such tax exemptions is another matter, but this particular instance is, in my opinion, completely satisfactory.
The 1960 tax book for East Greenwich indicates a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollars.
With our current $3 per hundred tax rate, it is safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant as the best way to meet these problems.
In order to attract additional industry that is compatible with this community it is all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure.
As this tax base grows so then can your medium and low density residential areas grow.
Mr. Richard Preston, executive director of the New Hampshire State Planning and Development Commission, in his remarks to the Governors Conference on Industrial Development at Providence on October 8, 1960, warned against the fallacy of attempting to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal services such as schools when he said : if this is the fundamental reason for a community's interest or if this is the basic approach, success if any will be difficult to obtain.
He went on to say : in the first place, industry per se is not dedicated to the role of savior of foundering municipalities.
It is not in business for the purpose of absorbing increased municipal costs no matter how high a purpose that may be.
While Councilman Olson cited the anticipated increase in school costs in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer, the impact upon a school system does not have to be measured only in increased taxes to find alarm in uncontrolled growth.
We in East Greenwich have the example of two neighboring communities, one currently utilizing double sessions in their schools, and the other facing this prospect next year.
It has already been reported in your newspapers that the East Greenwich School Committee is considering additions to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodations for a school population that we know will increase.
If they are to be commended for foresight in their planning, what then is the judgment of a town council that compounds this problem during the planning stage?
Where then is the sound planning and cooperation between agencies within the community that you have called for in other editorials?
I submit that it cannot be dismissed simply by saying we are not facing the facts of life.
The fruitful course of metropolitanization that you recommend is currently practiced by the town of East Greenwich and had its inception long before we learned what it was called.
For example : 1.
The East Greenwich Police Department utilizes the radio transmission facilities of the Warwick Police Department, thereby eliminating duplication of facilities and ensuring police coordination in the Cowessett-*east Greenwich-*potowomut area of the two communities.
2.
The East Greenwich Fire District services parts of Warwick as well as East Greenwich.
3.
The taxpayers of East Greenwich appropriate sums of money, as do other Kent County communities, for the support of the Kent County Memorial Hospital, a regional facility.
4.
The East Greenwich Free Library receives financial support from the town of East Greenwich and the City of Warwick to supplement its endowment.
5.
Feelers were put out last year to the City of Warwick, as reported in your newspapers, suggesting investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the Potowomut and Cowessett areas of Warwick along with East Greenwich.
6.
East Greenwich was one of the first Rhode Island towns to enter into contract agreement with the Rhode Island Development Council for planning services we could not provide for ourselves.
7.
The education program for retarded children conducted by the East Greenwich school system has pupils from at least one neighboring community.
I feel compelled to write this because I am greatly concerned with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between types of growth in a town such as East Greenwich.
I believe it is an area in which professional planners have failed to set adequate guide posts ; and yet they cannot ignore this problem because it concerns the implementation of nearly all the planning programs they have devised.
These programs are volumes of waste paper and lost hours if the citizens of a community must stand aside while land developers tell them when, where, and in what manner the community shall grow.
We have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these conditions.
Until professional planners meet this situation squarely and update the concepts of zoning in a manner acceptable to the courts, I hope we in East Greenwich can continue to shape our own destiny.
I would like very much, on behalf of my husband and myself, to send our eternal thanks to all the wonderful people responsible for the Gabrielle Fund.
It is indeed true, as stated in the famous novel of our day, For Whom The Bell Tolls, that no man is an island, entirely of itself ; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main.
Thanks to the generosity of Mr. Irving J. Fain, president of the Temple Beth El ; Rev. De*witt Clemens, pastor of the Mathewson Street Methodist Church ; Mr. Felix Miranda, of the Imperial Knife Co. ; and to Mrs. Rozella Switzer, regional director of The National Conference of Christians and Jews, who asked them to serve as a committee for the fund.
It is through them that we have become aware of the divine humanity in man, and therefore, that most people are noble, helpful and good.
Bless you my friends, for it is through love and service that brotherhood becomes a reality.
I am a sophomore at Mount Pleasant High School.
My future plans are to become a language teacher.
Of course, having this desire, I am very interested in education.
A few weeks ago, I read in the Bulletin that there were to be given Chinese classes in Cranston.
The article also said that a person had to be 18 years old or over, and must not be going to high school to attend these classes.
The following week, I read in the Sunday paper that the students of Russia begin European and Asian languages in the seventh grade.
I wish you could see the situation as I see it.
If Russian pupils have to take these languages, how come American students have a choice whether or not to take a language, but have to face so many exceptions?
I do not think that America is like Russia, not in the least ] I am proud of my country, the small city I live in, my wonderful parents, my friends and my school ; but I am also a young, able and willing girl who wants to study the Chinese language but is not old enough.
Then people wonder why Russian pupils are more advanced than American students.
Well, there lies your answer.
At the height of the first snowstorm we had, it was impossible for me to get medical attention needed during an emergency.
However, the East Providence Rescue Squad made its way through to my home in time of desperation.
Words cannot tell of the undivided attention and comfort their service gave to me.
The concern they felt for me was such as I shall never forget and for which I will always be grateful.
The rescue squad is to be praised immensely for the fine work they do in all kinds of weather.
Had they not gotten me to the hospital when they did, perhaps I would not be here to commend them at this time.
Many thanks for a job well done.
The Providence Sunday Journal article ( Jan. 29 ) asking whether American taxpayers are being victimized by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veterans who have non-service-connected disabilities sounds as though The Providence Journal is desperate for news.
Usually a veteran has to hang himself to get space on the front page.
On the question of admission to Veterans Administration hospitals of service-connected and non-service-connected disabled veterans, it must be recognized that there are many men who are greatly affected by war service.
It can manifest itself before discharge from service, or it can come out years later.
There is one other point we should never lose sight of : many veterans who enter *j hospitals as non-service cases later qualify as service-connected.
No psychiatrist could tell me that the experience in a war can not have its effect in the ensuing years.
The arguments advanced by those individuals and groups who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case, seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wishes of the general public.
I believe in priority for service-connected disabled veterans in admission to *j hospitals.
But I don't believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patients.
This matter is of great importance, and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death, or at least serious injuries, for many veterans.
Some critics say that the length of stay in a hospital is too long.
There's a reason for this length of stay.
First of all, the admitting physician in the *j hospital gets the patient as a new patient.
He has no experience with this veteran's previous medical record.
If the doctor is conscientious, he wants to study the patient.
As a result, it takes a little longer than it would on the outside where the family physician knows about the patient.
Secondly, the *j physician knows that when the patient leaves the hospital, he is no longer going to have a chance to visit his patient.
So he keeps the veteran in until he can observe the effects of treatment or surgery.
The American public must be presented with the facts concerning *j hospitalization.
The public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a *j hospital, the tax dollar has to be paid one way or the other.
The responsibility is still going to be there whether they pay for a *j hospital or the tax dollar is spent for the state hospital.
An adequate system of *j hospitals is better equipped to care for the veterans than any 50 state hospitals.
It seems that open season upon veterans' hospitalization is once more upon us.
The American Medical Association is once again grinding out its tear-soaked propaganda based upon the high cost of the Veterans Administration medical program to the American taxpayer.
Do they, the A.*m.*a., offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world?
We veterans acknowledge the fact that as time passes the demand for medical care at *j hospitals will grow proportionately as age fosters illness.
Nevertheless, we wonder at the stand of the A.*m.*a. on the health problem confronting the aged.
They opposed the Forand bill, which would have placed the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction ; yet they supported the Eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollars ( matched incidentally by a federal grant ) to initiate.
A lousy job Chicago, Aug. 9 -- no doubt there have been moments during every Presidency when the man in the White House has had feelings of frustration, exasperation, exhaustion, and even panic.
This we can sympathetically understand.
But no President ever before referred to his as a lousy job ( as Walter Trohan recently quoted President Kennedy as doing in conversation with Sen. Barry Goldwater ).
During his aggressive campaign to win his present position, Mr. Kennedy was vitriolic about this country's prestige abroad.
What does he think a remark like this lousy one does to our prestige and morale?
If the President of the United States really feels he won himself a lousy job, then heaven help us all.
Questions shelters Evansville, Ind., Aug. 5 -- Defense Secretary Robert S. Mc*namara has asked Congress for authority and funds to build fallout shelters costing about 200 million dollars.
Why should Congress even consider allowing such a sum for that which can give no protection?
Top scientists have warned that an area hit by an atomic missile of massive power would be engulfed in a suffocating fire storm which would persist for a long time.
The scientists have also warned that no life above ground or underground, sheltered or unsheltered could be expected to survive in an area at least 50 miles in diameter.
This sum spent for foreign economic aid, the peace corps, food for peace, or any other program to solve the problems of the underdeveloped countries would be an investment that would pay off in world peace, increased world trade, and prosperity for every country on the globe.
Let us prepare for peace, instead of for a war which would mean the end of civilization.
Short shorts on the campus Chicago, Aug. 4 -- it seems college isn't what it should be.
I refer to the attire worn by the students.
Upon a visit to a local junior college last week, I was shocked to see the young ladies wearing short shorts and the young men wearing Bermuda shorts.
Is this what our children are to come face to face with when they are ready for college in a few years?
Education should be uppermost in their minds, but with this attire how can anyone think it is so?
It looks more like they are going to play at the beach instead of taking lessons on bettering themselves.
High school students have more sense of the way to dress than college students.
Many high school students go past my house every day, and they look like perfect ladies and gentlemen.
No matter how hot the day, they are dressed properly and not in shorts.
Masaryk award Chicago, Aug. 9 -- the granting of the Jan Masaryk award August 13 to Senator Paul Douglas is a bitter example of misleading minorities.
Douglas has consistently voted to aid the people who killed Masaryk, and against principles Masaryk died to uphold.
Douglas has voted for aid to Communists and for the destruction of individual freedom ( public housing, foreign aid, etc. ).
Subsidies from *j Oak Park, Aug. 8 -- in Today's Voice, the *j is urged to reduce fares for senior citizens.
Rising costs have increased the difficulties of the elderly, and I would be the last to say they should not receive consideration.
But why is it the special responsibility of the *j to help these people?
Why should *j regular riders subsidize reduced transportation for old people any more than the people who drive their own cars or walk to work should?
The welfare of citizens, old and young, is the responsibility of the community, not only of that part of it that rides the *j.
C*t*a regulars already subsidize transportation for school children, policemen, and firemen.
Marketing meat Chicago, Aug. 9 -- in reply to a letter in Today's Voice urging the sale of meat after 6 p.m., I wish to state the other side of the story.
I am the wife of the owner of a small, independent meat market.
My husband's hours away from home for the past years have been from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. the early part of the week, and as late as 8 or 9 on week-ends.
Now he is apparently expected to give up his evenings -- and Sundays, too, for this is coming.
There is a trend to packaging meat at a central source, freezing it, and shipping it to outlying stores, where meat cutters will not be required.
If a customer wishes a special cut, it will not be available.
We are slowly being regimented to having everything packaged, whether we want it or not.
Most women, in this age of freezers, shop for the entire week on week-ends, when prices are lower.
Also, many working wives have children or husbands who take over the shopping chores for them.
Independent market owners work six days a week ; and my husband hasn't had a vacation in 14 years.
No, we are not greedy.
But if we closed the store for a vacation, we would lose our customers to the chain stores in the next block.
The meat cutters' union, which has a history of being one of the fairest and least corrupt in our area, represents the little corner markets as well as the large supermarkets.
What it is trying to do is to protect the little man, too, as well as trying to maintain a flow of fresh meat to all stores, with choice of cut being made by the consumer, not the store.
The Legion Convention and Sidney Holzman Chicago, Aug. 9 -- I, too, congratulate the American Legion, of which I am proud to have been a member for more than 40 years, on the recent state convention.
I regret that Bertha Madeira ( Today's Voice ) obtained incorrect information.
Had I been granted the floor on a point of personal privilege, the matter she raised would have been clarified.
The resolution under discussion at the convention was to require the boards of election to instruct judges to properly display the American flag.
Judges under the jurisdiction of the Chicago board of election commissioners are instructed to do this.
The resolution further asked that polling place proprietors affix an attachment to their premises for the display of the flag.
It was my desire to advise the membership of the Legion that the majority of polling places are on private property and, without an amendment to the law, we could not enforce this.
My discussion with reference to the resolution was that we should commend those citizens who serve as judges of election and who properly discharge their duty and polling place proprietors who make available their private premises, and not by innuendo criticize them.
At no time did I attempt to seek approval or commendation for the members of the Chicago board of election commissioners for the discharge of their duties.
Teaching the handicapped Chicago, Aug. 7 -- the Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children wishes to commend the recent announcement by the Catholic charities of the archdiocese of Chicago and De*paul University of the establishment of the Institute for Special Education at the university for the training of teachers for physically handicapped and mentally retarded children.
In these days of serious shortage of properly trained teachers qualified to teach physically handicapped and mentally handicapped children, the establishment of such an institute will be a major contribution to the field.
The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children, which for 20 years has had the responsibility of coordinating the services of tax supported and voluntary organizations serving handicapped children, of studying the needs of handicapped children in Illinois, and of promoting more adequate services for them, indeed welcomes this new important resource which will help the people of Illinois toward the goal of providing an education for all of its children.
From Candlelight Club Minneapolis, Aug. 7 -- I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed your June 25 article on Liberace, and to thank you for it.
Please do put more pictures and articles in about Liberace, as he is truly one of our greatest entertainers and a really wonderful person.
More school, less pay Chicago, Aug. 7 -- is this, perhaps, one of the things that is wrong with our country?
Engineering graduates of Illinois Institute of Technology are reported receiving the highest average starting salaries in the school's history -- $550 a month.
My son, who has completed two years in engineering school, has a summer job on a construction project as an unskilled laborer.
At a rate of $3.22 an hour he is now earning approximately $580 a month.
Ironic, is it not, that after completing years of costly scientific training he will receive a cut in pay from what he is receiving as an ordinary unskilled laborer?
The Dupont case ( editorial comment on this letter appears elsewhere on this page ).
Washington, Aug. 4 -- your July 26 editorial regarding the position of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy on prospective tax relief for Du*pont stockholders is based on an erroneous statement of fact.
As a result, your criticism of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the Department of Justice was inaccurate, unwarranted and unfair.
The editorial concerned legislative proposals to ease the tax burden on Du*pont stockholders, in connection with the United States Supreme Court ruling that Du*pont must divest itself of its extensive General Motors stock holdings.
These proposals would reduce the amount of tax that Du*pont stockholders might have to pay -- from an estimated 1.1 billion dollars under present law to as little as 192 million dollars.
Congressman Wilbur D. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, asked the Department of Justice for its views on these legislative proposals as they related to anti-trust law enforcement.
The Attorney General responded by letter dated July 19.
Copies of this letter were made avaliable to the press and public.
In this letter, Mr. Kennedy made it clear that he limited his comment only to one consideration -- what effect the legislative proposals might have on future anti-trust judgments.
There are a number of other considerations besides this one but it is for the Congress, not the Department of Justice, to balance these various considerations and make a judgment about legislation.
Yet your editorial said : now the Attorney General writes that no considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion.
What Mr. Kennedy, in fact, wrote was : it is the Department's view that no anti-trust enforcement considerations justify any loss of revenue of this proportion.
The editorial, by omitting the words anti-trust enforcement, totally distorted Mr. Kennedy's views.
The headline is offensive, particularly in view of the total inaccuracy of the editorial.
Congresswoman Church Wilmette, Aug. 7 -- I concur most heartily with today's letter on the futility of writing to Sen. Dirksen and Sen. Douglas.
But when you write to Congresswoman Church, bless her heart, your letter is answered fully and completely.
Should she disagree, she explains why in detail.
When she agrees, you can rest assured her position will remain unchanged.
I think we have the hardest working, best representative in Congress.
Harmful drinks Downers Grove, Aug. 8 -- a recent news story reported that Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin delayed 103 airplane passengers 10 minutes in London while they finished their drinks.
They do our country great harm by such actions.
Those in the public eye should be good examples of American citizens while abroad.
The plane should have started at the scheduled time and left Sinatra and Martin to guzzle.
Toward socialism Providence, Aug. 5 -- overt socialism means government ownership and management of a nation's main industries.
In covert socialism -- toward which America is moving -- private enterprise retains the ownership title to industries but government thru direct intervention and excessive regulations actually controls them.
In order to attract new industries, 15 states or more are issuing tax free bonds to build government owned plants which are leased to private enterprise.
This is a step toward overt socialism.
Issuing bonds for plant construction has brought new industries to certain regions.
Workers of the party to the editor : Sir -- we are writing in reference to a recent suggestion made to the staff of the Public Health Nursing Service of Jersey City ( registered professional nurses with college background and varying experiences ).
The day before Election Day, to which we are entitled as a legal holiday, we were informed to report to our respective polls to work as workers of the party.
Being ethical and professional people interested in community health and well-being, we felt this wasn't a function of our position.
Such tactics reek of totalitarianism ] as we understand, this directive was given to all city and county employes.
To our knowledge no nurse in our agency has been employed because of political affiliation.
We, therefore, considered the suggestion an insult to our intelligence, ethics, Bill of Rights, etc..
Our only obligation for this day is to vote, free of persuasion, for the person we feel is capable in directing the public.
This is our duty -- not as nurses or city employes -- but as citizens of the United States.
Plus-one shelters to the editor : Sir -- I read of a man who felt he should not build a fallout shelter in his home because it would be selfish for him to sit secure while his neighbors had no shelters.
Does this man live in a neighborhood where all are free loaders unwilling to help themselves, but ready to demand that the community help and protect them?
Community shelters are, of course, necessary for those having no space for shelter.
If in a town of 2,000 private homes, half of them have shelters, the need for the community shelters will be reduced to that extent.
In designing his home fallout shelter there is nothing to prevent a man from planning to shelter that home's occupants, plus-one -- so he will be able to take in a stranger.
I hope the man who plans to sit on his hands until the emergency comes will have a change of heart, will get busy and be the first member of our plus-one shelter club.
Escape to the editor : Sir -- people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space.
It's simple enough from my point of view.
I am for it.
It is the only method left for a man to escape from a woman's world.
Supports Katanga to the editor : Sir -- when the colonies decided upon freedom from England, we insisted, through the Declaration of Independence, that the nations of the world recognize us as a separate political entity.
It is high time the United States began to realize that the God-given rights of men set forth in that document are applicable today to Katanga.
In the United Nations Charter, the right of self-determination is also an essential principle.
This, again, applies to Katanga.
The people of Katanga had fought for, and obtained, their freedom from the Communist yoke of Antoine Gizenga, and his cohorts.
By political, economic, geographic and natural standards, they were justified in doing so.
The United States and the U.*n. denounce their own principles when they defend the Communist oppressors and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the Katangans.
County college costs to the editor : Sir -- permit me to commend your editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county colleges will substantially increase local tax burdens and that taxpayers have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit them to.
The bill which passed the Assembly last May and is now pending in the Senate should be given careful scrutiny.
The procedure for determining the amounts of money to be spent by county colleges and raised by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayers.
Under the proposal the members of the board of trustees of a county college will be appointed ; none will be elected.
The trustees will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate.
This board will consist of two of the trustees of the college, and the director and two members of the board of freeholders.
It will determine the amount of money to be spent by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholders, which shall appropriate in the same manner as other appropriations are made by it the amount so certified and the amount shall be assessed, levied and collected in the same manner as moneys appropriated for other purposes.
The approval of only three members of the board of school estimate is required to certify the amount of money to be allotted to the college.
Since two of these could be trustees of the college, actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elected official to impose a levy of millions of dollars of tax revenue.
This is taxation without representation.
Taxing improvements to the editor : Sir -- your editorial, Housing Speedup, is certainly not the answer to our slum problems.
The very rules and regulations in every city are the primary case of slum conditions.
Change our taxing law so that no tax shall be charged to any owner for additions or improvements to his properties.
Then see what a boom in all trades, as well as slum clearance at no cost to taxpayers, will happen.
Our entire economy will have a terrific uplift.
Natural causes to the editor : Sir -- an old man is kicked to death by muggers.
The medical examiner states that death was due to natural causes.
I once heard a comedian say that if you are killed by a taxicab in New York, it is listed as death due to natural causes.
Praises exhibit to the editor : Sir -- every resident of this city should visit the Newark Museum and see the exhibit Our Changing Skyline in Newark.
It will be at the museum until March 30.
It is a revelation of what has been done, what is being done and what will be done in Newark as shown by architects' plans, models and pictures.
It shows what a beautiful city Newark will become and certainly make every Newarker proud of this city.
It should also make him desire to participate actively in civic, school and religious life of the community so that that phase of Newark will live up to the challenge presented by this exhibit.
Parkway courtesy to the editor : Sir -- I hasten to join in praise of the men in the toll booths on the Garden State Parkway.
Recently I traveled the parkway from East Orange to Cape May and I found the most courteous group of men you will find anywhere.
One even gave my little dog a biscuit.
It was very refreshing.
Deep Peep Show the viewers of the Deep Peep Show at 15th and *j Streets N*w have an added attraction -- the view of a fossilized cypress swamp.
Twenty feet below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be constructed on this site, a black coal-like deposit has been encountered.
This is a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million years ago cypress-like trees were growing.
The fossilized remains of many of these trees are found embedded in the clay.
Some of the stumps are as much as three feet long, but most of them have been flattened by the pressure of the overlying sediments.
Although the wood has been changed to coal, much of it still retains its original cell structure.
In the clay are entombed millions of pollen grains and spores which came from plants growing in the region at the time.
These microfossils indicate the swamp was formed during the Lower Cretaceous period when dinosaurs were at their heyday and when the first flowering plants were just appearing.
The 15th Street deposit is not to be confused with the nearby famous Mayflower Hotel cypress swamp on 17th Street reported in The Washington Post, August 2, 1955, which was probably formed during the second interglacial period and is therefore much younger.
Working for peace recently the secretary of the Friends Committee on National Legislation was interviewed on the air.
While I respect his sincere concern for peace, he made four points that I would like to question.
1.
He said, let's work for peace instead of protection from aggression.
I would ask, why not do both?
Military power does not cause war ; war is the result of mistrust and lack of understanding between people.
Are we not late, especially those of us who call ourselves Friends, in doing enough about this lack of understanding?
2.
As to protection, the speaker disapproved of shelters, pointing out that fallout shelters would not save everyone.
Is this a reason for saving no one?
Would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because his boat could not pick up everyone?
3.
The speaker suggested that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face.
If the world comes to this, wouldn't it be the very time when courage and American know-how would be needed to help survivors rebuild?
Many of our young people think it would.
4.
Lastly, the speaker decried our organized program of emergency help calling it Civilian Defense.
In 1950, Public Law 920 created Civil Defense ( different from Civilian-groups of World War 2 ), a responsibility of the Government at all levels to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster, natural or manmade.
Far from creating fear, as the speaker suggests, preparedness -- knowing what to do in an emergency -- gives people confidence.
Civil Defense has far to go and many problems to solve, but is it not in the best spirit of our pioneer tradition to be not only willing, but prepared to care for our own families and help our neighbors in any disaster -- storm, flood, accident or even war?
Pets in apartments it seems rather peculiar that residents of apartments are denied the right of providing themselves with the protection and companionship of dogs.
I feel that few burglars would be prone to break and enter into someone's apartment if they were met with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide.
In addition, would not the young female public of Washington be afforded a greater degree of protection at night when they are on the streets if they were accompanied by a dog on a leash?
I grant that the dog may not be really protective, based on his training, but if you were roaming the streets looking for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest, how quick would you be to attack a person strolling with a dog?
I would like to suggest that the landlords and Commissioners get together and consider liberalizing the practice of prohibiting dogs in apartments.
Sidewalk cafes use the terraces of the Capitol for a sidewalk cafe?
Could Senator Humphrey be serious in his proposal?
Is nothing in this country more sacred than the tourists' comfort?
Perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafes could be extended.
The Lincoln and Jefferson Memorials are rather bleak.
Why not put a cafe in each so the tourists would not have to travel too far to eat?
Unfortunately the cafes might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season.
As an added suggestion to balance the budget, the Government could sell advertising space on the Washington Monument.
It is visible throughout the city, and men from Madison Ave. would jump at the chance.
Sen. Hubert Humphrey is obviously a man with a soul and heart.
He, like most of us, wants to be able to sit, to contemplate and be moved by the great outdoors.
Let us have more benches and fewer forbidden areas around fountains and gardens.
Let us, like the French, have outdoor cafes where we may relax, converse at leisure and enjoy the passing crowd.
Dissenting views of senators two strong dissents from the majority report of the Joint Economic Committee ( May 2 ) by Senators Proxmire and Butler allege that the New Deal fiscal policy of the Thirties did not work.
For a neutral Germany Soviets said to fear resurgence of German militarism to the editor of the New York Times : for the first time in history the entire world is dominated by two large, powerful nations armed with murderous nuclear weapons that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity.
The United States and Soviet Russia have enough nuclear weapons to destroy all nations.
Recent statements by well-known scientists regarding the destructive power of the newest nuclear bombs and the deadly fall-outs should be sufficient to still the voices of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiations.
President Kennedy was right when he said, we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate.
I have just returned from a seven-week trip to Europe and the Far East.
It is quite evident that the people of Western Europe are overwhelmingly opposed to participation in a nuclear war.
The fact is that the Italians, French and British know that they have no defense against nuclear bombs.
We have no right to criticize them, as they realize they would be sitting ducks in a nuclear war.
We should stand firmly and courageously for our right to free access into Berlin.
It would be criminal folly if the Communists tried to prevent us.
But there is nothing we can do to stop Soviet Russia from granting de facto recognition to East Germany.
Soviet Russia has been invaded twice by German troops in a generation.
In the last war Russia lost more than ten million killed and its lands and factories were devastated.
Probable agreement the truth is that Communist Russia fears the resurgence of German militarism.
Berlin is merely being used by Moscow as a stalking horse.
Actually, the Communists, out of fear of a united and armed Germany, would probably be willing to agree to a disarmed Germany that would be united and neutral and have its independence guaranteed by the U.*n..
If the Communists are sincere in wanting a united, neutral and disarmed Germany, it might well be advantageous for the German people in this nuclear age.
It could provide security without cost of armaments and increase German prosperity and lessen taxation.
France and other Western European nations likewise fear a rearmed Germany.
If the German people favor such a settlement we should not oppose Germany following the example of Austria.
President Kennedy has urged a peace race on disarmament that might be called Operation Survival which has many facets.
Why not make a beginning with a united and disarmed Germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bombing would be guaranteed by the Big Four powers and the United States?
A united Germany, freed of militarism, might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorized and tortured world.
Meeting U.*n. obligations to the editor of the New York Times : in your editorial of Sept. 30 The Smoldering Congo you make the following comment : far too many states are following the Russian example in refusing to pay their assessments.
It is up to the Assembly to take action against them.
They are violating their Charter obligation, the prescribed penalty for which is suspension of membership or expulsion.
I would like to quote from the Charter of the United Nations : Article 17, Section 1 : the General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the Organization.
Section 2 : the expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly.
Article 19 : a Member of the United Nations which is in arrears in the payment of its financial contributions to the Organization shall have no vote in the General Assembly if the amount of its arrears equals or exceeds the amount of the contributions due from it for the preceding two full years.
The U.*s.*s.*r. and her followers are careful in paying their obligations to the regular budget.
But they refuse, as do the Arab states, to support the United Nations' expenses of maintaining the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East as a buffer between Egypt and Israel, and the U.*n. troops in the Congo, which expenses are not covered by the regular budget of the United Nations, but by a special budget.
According to the official interpretation of the Charter, a member cannot be penalized by not having the right to vote in the General Assembly for nonpayment of financial obligations to the special United Nations' budgets, and of course cannot be expelled from the Organization ( which you suggested in your editorial ), due to the fact that there is no provision in the Charter for expulsion.
To aid international law Connally amendment's repeal held step toward world order to the editor of the New York Times : in your Sept. 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the First Session of the Eighty-seventh Congress you referred to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril.
Yet your list of things left undone did not include repeal of the Connally amendment to this country's domestic jurisdiction reservation to its adherence to the Statute of the International Court of Justice.
The Connally amendment says that the United States, rather than the court, shall determine whether a matter is essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of the United States in a case before the World Court to which the United States is a party.
If the case is thus determined by us to be domestic, the court has no jurisdiction.
Since the Connally amendment has the effect of giving the same right to the other party to a dispute with the United States, it also prevents us from using the court effectively.
Yet although the Kennedy Administration, and the Eisenhower Administration before it, have both declared themselves solidly for repeal of the Connally amendment, as contrary to our best interests, no action has yet been taken.
Our destiny in these perilous times should be to lead strongly in the pursuit of peace, with justice, under law.
To achieve this destiny, acts as well as words are needed -- not only acts that lead to physical strength but also acts that lead to strength based on right doing and respect.
What better affirmative step could be taken to this end than repeal of the Connally amendment -- an act which could expose the United States to no practical risk yet would put an end to our self-judging attitude toward the court, enable us to utilize it, and advance in a tangible way the cause of international law and order?
We believe that the list of vital things left undone to date by the Eighty-seventh Congress should have included repeal by the Senate of the Connally amendment.
For better subway services to the editor of the New York Times : many home-bound subway riders utilizing the Flushing-*main Street express are daily confronted with the sight of the local departing from the Woodside station as their express comes to a stop, leaving them stranded and strained.
To the tens of thousands who must transfer to ride to Seventy-fourth Street and change for the *j, this takes a daily toll of time and temper.
The Transit Authority has recently placed in operation hold lights at *j Thirty-ninth and Fifty-ninth Street stations in Brooklyn.
This holds the local until the express passengers change trains.
Without question, this time and temper saver should be immediately installed at the Woodside station.
Phone service criticized to the editor of the New York Times : as a business man I have to use the telephone constantly, from three to four hours a day.
In the last few years the telephone company has managed to automate many areas of their service.
It has not been any great mental effort on my part to keep up with this mechanization which has brought about new ways of dialing.
However, there are still several types of calls that necessitate the use of telephone operators.
I have been absolutely shocked at the ineptness of the young ladies who are servicing person-to-person calls, special long-distance calls, etc..
Either it is lack of training, lack of proper screening when hiring, lack of management or possibly lack of interest on the part of the telephone company, which does have a Government-blessed monopoly.
Fair-priced funeral to the editor : I disagree with the writer who says funeral services should be government-controlled.
The funeral for my husband was just what I wanted and I paid a fair price, far less than I had expected to pay.
But the hospitals and doctors should be.
Helping retarded children to the editor : recently I visited the very remarkable Pilgrim School for retarded children.
Hazel Park donates its recreation center, five days a week, to the school.
There is no charge and no state aid.
Kiwanis, American Legion and other groups donate small sums and the mothers do what they can to bring in dollars for its support.
There are 70 children there and the mothers donate one day a week to the school.
Reading, writing and simple arithmetic are taught along with such crafts as working in brass.
They make beautiful objects.
Enough trading stamps were collected to buy a 12-passenger station wagon.
Southfield schools furnish an old 45-passenger bus ( the heater in which needs repair since some of the children ride a long distance and need the heat ).
The school is located at 9-1/2 Mile Road, Woodward Heights.
Visitors are welcome to come see what these dedicated mothers can do.
Jobs for Cavanagh to the editor : I was surprised at Mayor Miriani's defeat, but perhaps Mayor-elect Cavanagh can accomplish some things that should have been done years ago.
Maybe he can clean out the white elephants in some of the city departments such as welfare, *j and sanitation.
Negligence in garbage and rubbish collections and alley cleaning is great.
He should put the police back to patrolling and walking the streets at night.
There should be better bus service and all of our city departments and their various branches need a general and complete overhauling.
Our litterbug ordinances are not enforced and I have yet to read of a conviction in a littering case.
Drunken truck drivers in the city departments should be weeded out.
Educate the city employes to give real service to the public.
After all, they are paid by the public, they should be examples.
Church finds news features are helpful to the editor : at a recent meeting of the Women's Association of the Trumbull Ave. United Presbyterian Church, considerable use was made of material from The Detroit News on the King James version of the New Testament versus the New English Bible.
Some members of the organization called attention also to the article on hymns of inspiration, the Daily Prayer and Three Minutes A Day, as being very helpful.
We feel that The Detroit News is to be complimented upon arranging for articles on these subjects and we hope that it will continue to provide material along wholesome lines.
Rude youngsters to the editor : thank you for the article by George Sokolsky on the public apathy to impudence.
How old do you have to be to remember when Americans, especially children, were encouraged to be polite?
Why has this form of gentility gone out of American life?
How can we old-fashioned parents, who still feel that adults are due some respect from children, battle the new type of advertising that appears on *j without denying the children the use of television entirely?
Writers of ads must get their inspiration from the attitude of modern parents they have observed.
From necessity, they are also inspired by the hard-sell attitude of the sponsor, so, finally, it is the sponsor who must take the responsibility for the good or bad taste of his advertising.
Dunes park advocate to the editor : I commend Senator Hart for his brave fight to establish a national park in the dunes area.
Ghost town?
To the editor of the Inquirer : I just wish to congratulate Inspector Trimmer and his efficient police troops in cleaning the city of those horrible automobiles.
We have now a quiet city, fewer automobiles, less congestion, and fewer retail customers shopping in center city.
Good for Mr. Trimmer.
Maybe he will help to turn our fair city into a ghost town.
Defends big trucks to the editor of the Inquirer : I worked on the Schuylkill Expressway and if it had not been for the big trucks carrying rock and concrete there wouldn't be an Expressway.
Without these massive trucks highways would still be just an idea of the future.
Mr. George Hough ( Oct. 30 ) sounds like a business man who waits until the last minute to leave his home or shop.
The trucks today help pay for this highway.
They try to keep within the speed limits.
Although today's trucks are as fast as passenger cars, a truck driver has to be a sensible person and guard against hogging the road.
Out of school at 14 to the editor of the Inquirer : the letter writer who suggested saving money by taking kids out of school at 14 should have signed his letter simpleton instead of simplicitude.
Such kids only wind up among the unemployed on relief or in jail where they become a much bigger burden.
There are lots of jobs available for trained high school graduates, but not for the dropouts.
What we need is more vocational training in high schools, not more dropouts.
Two wrongs to the editor of the Inquirer : I suppose I am missing some elementary point but I honestly cannot see how two wrongs can make a right ] I am referring to this country conducting atmosphere tests of nuclear bombs just because Russia is.
Will our bombs be cleaner or will their fallout be less harmful to future generations of children?
If an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have is more than adequate to fulfill any military objective required of it.
As I see it, if war starts and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back, the nuclear weapons we now have -- at least the bombs -- can inflict all the demage that is necessary.
Why do we need bigger and better bombs?
I repeat, two wrongs do not make a right.
We tremble not to the editor of the Inquirer : everyone should take time to read Martin Luther's Hymn A Mighty Fortress Is Our God.
Especially the first half of the third verse : out of the race to the editor of the Inquirer : to our everlasting shame, we led the world in this nuclear arms race sixteen years ago when we dropped the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
Having led the world in this mad race I pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race.
Are we to be the master of the atom, or will the atom be our master -- and destroy us ] why trust Jagan?
To the editor of the Inquirer : just because Cheddi Jagan, new boss of British Guiana, was educated in the United States is no reason to think he isn't a Red.
We have quite a few home-grown specimens of our own.
If we go all gooey over this newest Castro ( until he proves he isn't ) we've got rocks in our heads.
How many times must we get burned before we learn?
Russia and U.*n. to the editor of the Inquirer : just to remind the Communists that the bombs dropped on Japan were to end a war not start one.
The war could have continued many years with many thousands killed on both sides.
Intelligent people will admit that bombs and rockets of destruction are frightening whether they fall on Japan, London or Pearl Harbor.
That is why the United Nations was formed so that intelligent men with good intentions from all countries could meet and solve problems without resorting to war.
Russia has showed its intentions by exploding bombs in peace time to try to frighten the world.
Why aren't the Soviets expelled from the U.*n.?
Belated tribute to the editor of the Inquirer : while better late than never may have certain merits, the posthumous award of the Nobel Prize for Peace to the late Dag Hammarskjold strikes me as less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation.
Had it been bestowed while the Secretary General of the United Nations was living, unquestionably he would have been greatly encouraged in pursuing a difficult and, in many ways, thankless task.
According to one report, however, Mr. Hammarskjold was considered too controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the coveted honor last spring.
Actually, of course, that label controversial applied only because he was carrying out the mandate given him by the world organization he headed rather than following the dictates of the Soviet Union.
At Khrushchev's door, therefore, can be placed the primary blame but also at fault are those who permitted themselves to be intimidated.
It is well for us to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flowers withheld while they still can be enjoyed.
As has happened so often in the past, the ability to recognize true greatness has been inadequate and tardy.
People to people to the editor of the Inquirer : just a brief note of appreciation to Vice President Johnson and Pakistani camel driver Bashir Ahmad for providing a first-class example of people to people good will.
If only this could be done more often -- with such heartening results -- many of the earth's big problems would shrink to the insignificances they really are.
P.*s..
Thanks for your good coverage of Ahmad's visit, too ] expressway answer : East River Drive to the editor of the Inquirer : your continuing editorials concerning the Schuylkill Expressway are valuable ; however, several pertinent considerations deserve recognition.
One of the problems associated with the expressway stems from the basic idea.
We shuffle a large percentage of the cars across the river twice.
They start on the East side of the Schuylkill, have to cross over to the West to use the expressway and cross over again to the East at their destination.
Bridges, tunnels and ferries are the most common methods of river crossings.
Each one of these is, by its nature, a focal point or a point of natural congestion.
We should avoid these congestion points or, putting it another way, keep cars starting and ending on the East side of the river -- on the East side.
This can be accomplished by several logical steps : ( 1 ) widen the East River Drive at least one lane.
( 2 ) so widen it as to minimize the present curves and eliminate drainage problems.
( 3 ) paint continuous lane stripes and install overhead directional lights as on our bridges.
One additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carrying capability of the East River Drive by fifty percent.
( 4 ) this could be accomplished without the tremendous expenditures necessitated by the Schuylkill Expressway and without destroying the natural beauty of the East River Drive.
Shadow over Washington Square to the editor of the Inquirer : I wish to advocate two drastic changes in Washington Square : 1.
Take away George Washington's statue.
2.
Replace it with the statue of one or another of the world's famous dictators.
There's no sense in being reminded of times that were.
Washington Square seems not part of a free land.
It may remind one of Russia, China or East Berlin ; but it can't remind one of the freedom that Washington and the Continental soldiers fought for.
The Fairmount Park Commission will no doubt approve my two proposals, because it is responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the Square.
The matter may seem a small thing to some people, I know, but it's a very good start on the road to Totalitarianism the Commission has posted signs in Washington Square saying : the feeding of birds is prohibited in this square.
Fairmount Park Commission does each tentacle of the octopus of City Government reach out and lash at whatever it dislikes or considers an annoyance?
If birds don't belong in a square or park, what does?
They are the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature.
The trees are their homes ; but the Commission does not share such sentiments.
The whole official City apparently has an intense hatred toward birds.
Starlings and blackbirds are scared off by canon, from City Hall.
Just a preliminary measure.
If any are left, presently, we may expect to see signs specifically prohibiting the feeding of them too.
The City Government is not united in an all-out, to-the-death drive to stamp out gangs, delinquents, thugs, murderers, rapists, subversives.
Indeed no.
Let every policeman and park guard keep his eye on John and Jane Doe, lest one piece of bread be placed undetected and one bird survive.
Of course, in this small way of forcing the people to watch as tiny and innocent and dependent creatures die because we're afraid to feed them and afraid to protest and say, how come?
What's your motive?
Who wants this deed done?
-- in this small way do the leaders of a city, or of a nation, inure the masses to watching, or even inflicting, torture and death, upon even their fellow men.
One means to help the birds occurs to me : let the chimes that ring over Washington Square twice daily, discontinue any piece of music but one.
Let them offer on behalf of those creatures whose melody has been the joy of mankind since time began, the hymn Abide With Me.
We will know, and He will know, to whom it is rendered, what the birds would ask : not push-ups but stand-ups to the editor of the Inquirer : there is a trend today to bemoan the fact that Americans are too soft.
Unfortunately, those who would remedy our softness seek to do so with calisthenics.
They are working on the wrong part of our anatomy.
It is not our bodies but our hearts and heads that have grown too soft.
Ashamed of our wealth and power, afraid of so-called world opinion and addicted to peace, we have allowed our soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policies.
When we become firm enough to stand for those ideals which we know to be right, when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nations which do not permit self-determination, when we become strong enough to resist any more drifts towards socialism in our own Nation, when we recognize that our enemy is Communism not war, and when we realize that concessions to Communists do not insure peace or freedom, then, and only then will we no longer be soft.
America doesn't need to push-up, she needs to stand up ] disputes Stans column business scandal views to the editor : the new column by Maurice Stans regarding business scandals, is fair and accurate in most respects and his solution to the problem has some merit.
However, he states unequivocally the scandals in business are far less significant than the scandals in labor.
I must, in fairness, take issue with his premise, primarily because the so-called scandals in labor unions were very much connected with business scandals.
The area most prominently commented on during the Mc*clellan hearings had to do with sweetheart contracts.
These arrangements would have been impossible if the business community was truly interested in the welfare of its employes.
A sweetheart arrangement can come about as often by employers doing the corrupting as by unscrupulous labor leaders demanding tribute.
Anyone familiar with the details of the Mc*clellan hearings must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangements augmented employer profits far more than they augmented the earnings of the corruptible labor leaders.
Further, it should be recalled that some very definite steps were taken by Congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by its passage of the Landrum-*griffin Act.
Escalation unto death the nuclear war is already being fought, except that the bombs are not being dropped on enemy targets -- not yet.
It is being fought, moreover, in fairly close correspondence with the predictions of the soothsayers of the think factories.
They predicted escalation, and escalation is what we are getting.
The biggest nuclear device the United States has exploded measured some 15 megatons, although our *j are said to be carrying two 20-megaton bombs apiece.
Some time ago, however, Mr. Khrushchev decided that when bigger bombs were made, the Soviet Union would make them.
He seems to have at least a few 30- and 50-megaton bombs on hand, since we cannot assume that he has exploded his entire stock.
And now, of course, the hue and cry for counter-escalation is being raised on our side.
Khrushchev threatens us with a 100-megaton bomb?
So be it -- then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bombs of the common or hydrogen variety, and neutron bombs, which do not exist but are said to be the coming thing.
So escalation proceeds, ad infinitum or, more accurately, until the contestants begin dropping them on each other instead of on their respective proving grounds.
What is needed, Philip Morrison writes in The Cornell Daily Sun ( October 26 ) is a discontinuity.
The escalation must end sometime, and probably quite soon.
Only a discontinuity can end it, Professor Morrison writes.
The discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction, or that of diplomatic policy.
Morrison points out that since our country is more urbanized than the Soviet Union or Red China, it is the most vulnerable of the great powers -- Europe of course must be written off out of hand.
He feels, therefore, that to seek a discontinuity in the arms policy of the United States is the least risky path our government can take.
His proposal is opposed to that of Richard Nixon, Governor Rockefeller, past chairmen Strauss and Mc*cone of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Edward Teller and those others now enjoying their hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war.
These gentlemen are calling for a resumption of testing -- in the atmosphere -- on the greatest possible scale, all in the name of national security.
Escalation is their first love and their last ; they will be faithful unto death.
Capable as their minds may be in some directions, these guardians of the nation's security are incapable of learning, or even of observing.
If this capacity had not failed them, they would see that their enemy has made a disastrous miscalculation.
He has gained only one thing -- he has exploded a 50-megaton bomb and he probably has rockets with sufficient thrust to lob it over the shorter intercontinental ranges.
But if his purpose was to inspire terror, his action could hardly have miscarried more obviously.
Not terror, but anger and resentment have been the general reaction outside the Soviet sphere.
Khrushchev himself is reported to be concerned by the surge of animosity he has aroused, yet our own nuclear statesmen seem intent on following compulsively in his footsteps.
When one powerful nation strives to emulate the success of another, it is only natural.
Thus, when the Russians sent up their first sputnik, American chagrin was human enough, and American determination to put American satellites into orbit was perfectly understandable.
But to imitate an opponent when he has made the mistake of his life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly.
The tide turns when East Germans fled to the West by the thousands, paeans of joy rose from the throats of Western publicists.
They are less vocal now, when it is the West Berliners who are migrating.
The flood is not as great -- only 700 a week according to one apparently conservative account -- but it is symptomatic.
West Berlin morale is low and, in age distribution, the situation is unfavorable.
Nearly 18 per cent of West Berlin's 2,200,000 residents are sixty-five or older, only 12.8 per cent are under fifteen.
R. H. S. Crossman, M.*p., writing in The Manchester Guardian, states that departures from West Berlin are now running at the rate not of 700, but of 1,700 a week, and applications to leave have risen to 1,900 a week.
The official statistics show that 60 per cent are employed workers or independent professional people.
Whole families are moving and removal firms are booked for months ahead.
The weekly loss is partly counterbalanced by 500 arrivals each week from West Germany, but the hard truth, says Crossman, is that The closing off of East Berlin without interference from the West and with the use only of East German, as distinct from Russian, troops was a major Communist victory, which dealt West Berlin a deadly, possibly a fatal, blow.
The gallant half-city is dying on its feet.
Another piece of evidence appears in a dispatch from Bonn in The Observer ( London ).
Mark Arnold-*foster writes : people are leaving ( West Berlin ) because they think it is dying.
They are leaving so fast that the president of the West German Employers' Federation issued an appeal this week to factory workers in the West to volunteer for six months' front-line work in factories in West Berlin.
Berlin's resilience is amazing, but if it has to hire its labor in the West the struggle will be hard indeed.
The handwriting is on the wall.
The only hope for West Berlin lies in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city.
State Department officials refusing to show their passes at the boundary, and driving two blocks into East Berlin under military escort, will not avail.
Tanks lined up at the border will be no more helpful.
The materials for compromise are at hand : the Nation, Walter Lippmann and other sober commentators ( see Alan Clark on p. 367 ) have spelled them out again and again.
A compromise will leave both sides without the glow of triumph, but it will save Berlin.
Or the city can be a graveyard monument to Western intransigence, if that is what the West wants.
Vacancy the removal of Stalin's body from the mausoleum he shared with Lenin to less distinguished quarters in the Kremlin wall is not unprecedented in history.
It is, in fact, a relatively mild chastisement of the dead.
A British writer, Richard Haestier, in a book, Dead Men Tell Tales, recalls that in the turmoil preceding the French Revolution the body of Henry 4, who had died nearly 180 years earlier, was torn to pieces by a mob.
And in England, after the Restoration, the body of Cromwell was disinterred and hanged at Tyburn.
The head was then fixed on a pole at Westminster, and the rest of the body was buried under the gallows.
Contemplating these posthumous punishments, Stalin should not lose all hope.
In 1899, Parliament erected a statue to Cromwell in Westminster, facing Whitehall and there, presumably, he still stands.
Nikita Khrushchev, however, has created yet another problem for himself.
The Lenin tomb is obviously adequate for double occupancy, Moscow is a crowded city, and the creed of Communism deplores waste.
Who will take Stalin's place beside Lenin?
There is Karl Marx, of course, buried in London.
The Macmillan government might be willing to let him go, but he has been dead seventy-eight years and even the Soviet morticians could not make him look presentable.
Who, then, is of sufficient stature to lodge with Lenin?
Who but Nikita himself?
Since he has just shown who is top dog, he may not be ready to receive this highest honor in the gift of the Soviet people.
Besides, he can hardly avoid musing on the instability of death which, what with exhumations and rehabilitations, seems to match that of life.
Suppose he did lie beside Lenin, would it be permanent?
If some future Khrushchev decided to rake up the misdeeds of his revered predecessor, would not the factory workers pass the same resolutions applauding his dispossession?
When a man is laid to rest, he is entitled to stay put.
If Nikita buys a small plot in some modest rural cemetery, everyone will understand.
U Thant of Burma the appointment of U Thant of Burma as the U.*n.'s Acting Secretary General -- at this writing, the choice appears to be certain -- offers further proof that in politics it is more important to have no influential enemies than to have influential friends.
Mongi Slim of Tunisia and Frederick Boland of Ireland were early favorites in the running, but France didn't like the former and the Soviet Union would have none of the latter.
With the neutralists maintaining pressure for one of their own to succeed Mr. Hammarskjold, U Thant emerged as the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylaid by a veto.
What is interesting is that his positive qualifications for the post were revealed only as a kind of tail to his candidacy.
In all the bitter in-fighting, the squabbles over election procedures, the complicated numbers game that East and West played on the assistant secretaries' theme, the gentleman from Burma showed himself both as a man of principle and a skilled diplomat.
He has, moreover, another qualification which augurs well for the future.
He is a Buddhist, which means that to him peace and the sanctity of human life are not only religious dogma, but a profound and unshakable Weltanschauung.
U Thant of course, will hold office until the spring of 1963, when Mr. Hammarskjold's term would have come to an end.
Whether the compromises -- on both sides -- that made possible the interim appointment can then be repeated remains to be seen.
Mr. Khrushchev's demand for a troika is dormant, not dead ; the West may or not remain satisfied with the kind of neutralism that U Thant represents.
In a sense, the showdown promised by Mr. Hammarskjold's sudden and tragic death has been avoided ; no precedents have been set as yet ; structurally, the U.*n. is still fluid, vulnerable to the pressures that its new and enlarged membership are bringing to bear upon it.
But at least the pessimists who believed that the world organization had plunged to its death in that plane crash in the Congo have been proved wrong.
To the hills, girls.
No one who has studied the radical Right can suppose that words are their sole staple in trade.
These are mentalities which crave action -- and they are beginning to get it, as Messrs. Salsich and Engh report on page 372.
Even in areas where political connotations are ( deliberately?
) left vague, the spirit of vigilantism is spreading.
Friends, a picture magazine distributed by Chevrolet dealers, describes a paramilitary organization of employees of the Gulf Telephone Company at Foley, Alabama.
If the day should ever come that foreign invaders swarm ashore along the Gulf Coast, the account reads, they can count on heavy opposition from a group of commando-trained telephone employees -- all girls.
Heavily armed and mobilized as a fast-moving Civil Defense outfit, 23 operators and office personnel stand ready to move into action at a minute's notice.
According to Friends, the unit was organized by John Snook, a former World War 2 commando who is vice president and general manager of the telephone company.
The girls, very fetching in their uniforms, are shown firing rockets from a launcher mounted on a dump truck ; they are also trained with carbines, automatic weapons, pistols, rifles and other such ladies' accessories.
This may be opera bouffe now, but it will become more serious should the cold war mount in frenzy.
The country is committed to the doctrine of security by military means.
The doctrine has never worked ; it is not working now.
The official military establishment can only threaten to use its nuclear arms ; it cannot bring them into actual play.
A more dangerous formula for national frustration cannot be imagined.
As the civic temper rises, the more naive citizens begin to play soldier -- but the guns are real.
Soon they will begin to hunt down the traitors they are assured are in our midst.
All false gods resemble Moloch, at least in the early phases of their careers, so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice.
But there is reason in all things, and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car is exceeding all bounds in its demands.
The annual butchery of 40,000 American men, women and children to satiate its blood-lust is excessive ; a quota of 25,000 a year would be more than sufficient.
No other popular idol is accorded even that much grace.
If the railroads, for example, regularly slaughtered 25,000 passengers each year, the high priests of the cult would have cause to tremble for their personal safety, for such a holocaust would excite demands for the hanging of every railroad president in the United States.
But by comparison with the railroad, the motor car is a relatively new object of popular worship, so it is too much to hope that it may be brought within the bounds of civilized usage quickly and easily.
Yet it is plainly time to make a start, and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic, without being fanatical.
Here, then, is what Swift would have called a modest proposal by way of a beginning.
From next New Year's Day let us keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highways, publicizing it on all media of communication.
To avoid suspicion of bigotry, let the hand of vengeance be stayed until the meat-wagon has picked up the twenty-five thousandth corpse ; but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioners.
Then let the whole lot be hanged in a public mass execution on July 4, 1963.
The scene, of course, should be nine miles northwest of Centralia, Illinois, the geographical center of population according to the census.
A special grandstand, protected by awnings from the midsummer sun of Illinois, should be erected for occupancy by honored guests, who should include the ambassadors of all those new African nations as yet not quite convinced that the United States is thoroughly civilized.
The band should play the Rogues' March as a processional, switching to Hail Columbia, Happy Land ] as the trap is sprung.
Independence Day is the appropriate date as a symbolical reminder of the American article of faith that governments are instituted among men to secure to them certain inalienable rights, the first of which is life, and when any government becomes subversive of that end, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it.
The highway system is an agency of government, and when it grinds up 40,000 Americans every year the government is destroying its own taxpayers, which is obviously a silly thing for any government to do.
Hanging the responsible officials would not abolish the government, but would emphasize its accountability for the lives of its individual citizens, which would certainly alter it, and definitely for the better.
Moreover, the salubrious effects would not be exclusively political, but at least partially, and perhaps primarily social.
It would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of its ancillary beliefs and practices -- for instance, the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consists in proceeding from hither to yon, not for any advantage to be gained by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis, or, as it is generally termed, staying put.
True, the adherents of staying put are now reduced to a minor, even a miniscule sect, and their credo, home-keeping hearts are happiest, is as disreputable as Socinianism.
Nonetheless, although few in number they are a stubborn crew, as tenacious of life as the Hardshell Baptists, which suggests that there is some kind of vital principle embodied in their faith.
Perhaps there is more truth than we are wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of Tarheelia, Robert Ruark's grandfather, who was persuaded that the great curse of the modern world is all this gallivantin'.
In any event, the yearly sacrifice of 40,000 victims is a hecatomb too large to be justified by the most ardent faith.
Somehow our contemporary Moloch must be induced to see reason.
Since appeals to morality, to humanity, and to sanity have had such small effect, perhaps our last recourse is the deterrent example.
If we make it established custom that whenever butchery on the highways grows excessive, say beyond 25,000 per annum, then somebody is going to hang, it follows that the more eminent the victim, the more impressive the lesson.
To hang 50 governors might be preferable except that they are not directly related to the highways ; so, all things considered, the highway commissioners would seem to be elected.
As the new clouds of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth, the Soviet Union stands guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race.
But the guilt is shared by the United States, Britain and France, the other members of the atomic club.
Until Moscow resumed nuclear testing last September 1, the *j and *j had released more than twice as much radiation into the atmosphere as the Russians, and the fallout from the earlier blasts is still coming down.
As it descends, the concentration of radioactivity builds up in the human body ; for a dose of radiation is not like a flu virus which causes temporary discomfort and then dies.
The effect of radiation is cumulative over the years -- and on to succeeding generations.
So, while we properly inveigh against the new poisoning, history is not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the West were so quick to assume when Mr. Khrushchev made his cynical and irresponsible threat.
Shock, dismay and foreboding for future generations were legitimate reactions ; a holier-than-thou sermon was not.
On October 19, after the Soviets had detonated at least 20 nuclear devices, Ambassador Stevenson warned the *j General Assembly that this country, in self protection, might have to resume above-ground tests.
More recently, the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Dr. Glenn T. Seaborg, admitted to a news conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, that the *j might fall behind Russia ( he apparently meant in weapons development ) if the Soviets continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain.
The trial balloons are afloat.
All of which makes it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effects of fallout be understood.
But for the average citizen, unfortunately, this is one of science's worst-marked channels, full of tricky currents and unknown depths.
The scientists, in and out of government, do not agree on some of the most vital points, at least publicly.
On the one hand, the Public Health Service declared as recently as October 26 that present radiation levels resulting from the Soviet shots do not warrant undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substances by individuals or large population groups anywhere in the *j.
But the *j conceded that the new radioactive particles will add to the risk of genetic effects in succeeding generations, and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the United States.
Then it added : it is not possible to determine how extensive these ill effects will be -- nor how many people will be affected.
Having hedged its bets in this way, *j apparently decided it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all : at present radiation levels, and even at somewhat higher levels, the additional risk is slight and very few people will be affected.
Then, to conclude on an indeterminate note : nevertheless, if fallout increased substantially, or remained high for a long time, it would become far more important as a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world.
Dr. Linus Pauling, a Nobel Prize winner in chemistry, has been less ambiguous, whether you choose to agree with him or not.
After declaring, in an article last month in Frontier Magazine, that the Russian testing carries with it the possibility of the most tragic consequences of any action in the history of the world, he gave this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequences if the new Soviet shots totaled 200 megatons : the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generations 160,000 children around the world would be born with gross physical or mental defects.
Long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic, neonatal or childhood deaths and stillbirths over the next 20 generations, and between 200,000 and one million human beings now living would have their lives cut short by radiation-produced diseases such as leukemia.
Most of these would be in the Northern Hemisphere, where the fallout is concentrating.
Pauling's estimate of 200 megatons yield from the present series of Russian tests will probably turn out to be too high, but a total of 100 megatons is a distinct possibility.
The lack of scientific unanimity on the effects of radiation is due in part to insufficient data covering large population groups, from which agreed-on generalizations could be drawn.
But more than one conscientious researcher has been inhibited from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout has been made a political issue as well as a scientific problem.
Its dangerous effects have been downgraded to the public by some who believe national security requires further testing.
An illustration of this attitude is found in John A. Mc*cone's letter to Dr. Thomas Lauritsen, reported in a note elsewhere in this issue of the New Republic.
To this day the Atomic Energy Commission shies away from discussing the health aspects of fallout.
A recent study on radiation exposure by the *j division of biology and medicine stated : the question of the biological effect of ( radiation ) doses is not considered herein.
Of course, the *j is in a bind now.
If it comes down too hard on the potential dangers of fallout, it will box the President on resuming atmospheric tests.
So the Commission's announcements of the new Soviet shots have been confined to one or two bleak sentences, with the fission yield usually left vague.
Now, of course, that the Russians are the nuclear villains, radiation is a nastier word than it was in the mid, when the *j was testing in the atmosphere.
The prevailing official attitude then seemed to be that fallout, if not exactly good for you, might not be much worse than a bad cold.
After a nuclear blast, one bureaucrat suggested in those halcyon days, about all you had to do was haul out the broom and sweep off your sidewalks and roof.
Things aren't that simple anymore.
Yet if Washington gets too indignant about Soviet fallout, it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if America decides it too must start pushing up the radiation count.
How much fallout will we get?
As of October 25, the *j had reported 24 shots in the new Soviet series, 12 of them in a megaton range, including a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megatons ( the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million tons of *j ) ; and President Kennedy indicated there were one or two more than those reported.
Assuming the lower figure for the big blast and one shot estimated by the Japanese at 10 megatons, a conservative computation is that the 24 announced tests produced a total yield of at least 60 megatons.
Some government scientists say privately that the figure probably is closer to 80 megatons, and that the full 50-megaton bomb that Khrushchev mentioned may still be detonated.
If the new Soviet series has followed the general pattern of previous Russian tests, the shots were roughly half fission and half fusion, meaning a fission yield of 30 to 40 megatons thus far.
To this must be added the 90 to 92 megatons of fission yield produced between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that began in November, 1958.
Resuming atmospheric tests one of the inescapable realities of the Cold War is that it has thrust upon the West a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemmas.
The first dilemma was the morality of nuclear warfare itself.
That dilemma is as much with us as ever.
The second great dilemma has been the morality of nuclear testing, a dilemma which has suddenly become acute because of the present series of Soviet tests.
When this second dilemma first became obvious -- during the mid to late '50's -- the United States appeared to have three choices.
It could have unilaterally abandoned further testing on the grounds of the radiation hazard to future generations.
It could have continued testing to the full on the grounds that the radiation danger was far less than the danger of Communist world domination.
Or it could have chosen to find -- by negotiation -- some way of stopping the tests without loss to national security.
This third choice was in fact made.
With the resumption of Soviet testing and their intransigence at the Geneva talks, however, the hope that this third choice would prove viable has been shaken.
Once again, the United States must choose.
And once again, the choices are much the same.
Only this time around the conditions are different and the choice is far harder.
The first choice, abandoning tests entirely, would not only be unpopular domestically, but would surely be exploited by the Russians.
The second choice, full testing, has become even more risky just because the current Soviet tests have already dangerously contaminated the atmosphere.
The third choice, negotiation, presupposes, as Russian behavior demonstrates, a great deal of wishful thinking to make it appear reasonable.
We take the position, however, that the third choice still remains the only sane one open to us.
It is by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the arguments against it as a practical strategy are formidable.
Its primary advantage is that it is a moral choice ; one which, should it fail, will not have contaminated the conscience.
That is the contamination we most fear.
Leaving aside the choice of unilateral cessation of tests as neither sane nor clearly moral, the question must arise as to why resumption of atmospheric tests on our part would not be a good choice.
For that is the one an increasingly large number of prominent Americans are now proposing.
In particular, Governor Nelson Rockefeller has expressed as cogently and clearly as anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric tests.
Speaking recently in Miami, Governor Rockefeller said that to assure the sufficiency of our own weapons in the face of the recent Soviet tests, we are now clearly compelled to conduct our own nuclear tests.
Taking account of the fact that such a move on our part would be unpopular in world opinion, he argued that the responsibility of the United States is to do, confidently and firmly, not what is popular, but what is right.
What was missing in the Governor's argument, as in so many similar arguments, was a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what is right.
The possibility, as he asserted, that the Russians may get ahead of us or come closer to us because of their tests does not supply the needed ethical premise -- unless, of course, we have unwittingly become so brutalized that nuclear superiority is now taken as a moral demand.
Besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the Governor's case, one can ask seriously whether our lead over the Russians in quality and quantity of nuclear weapons is so slight as to make the tests absolutely necessary.
Recent statements by the President and Defense Department spokesmen have, to the contrary, assured us that our lead is very great.
Unless the Administration and the Defense Department have been deceiving us, the facts do not support the assertion that we are compelled to resume atmospheric testing.
It is perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric tests may, at some point in the future, be necessary and even justifiable.
But a resumption does not seem justifiable now.
What we need to realize is that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the Soviet tests had radically increased our own moral obligations.
We now have to think not only of our national security but also of the future generations who will suffer from any tests we might undertake.
This is an ethical demand which cannot be evaded or glossed over by talking exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of Communism.
Too often in the past Russian tactics have been used to justify like tactics on our part.
There ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what Russia does.
The refusal to resume atmospheric testing would be a good start.
Ecumenical hopes when his Holiness Pope John 23 first called for an Ecumenical Council, and at the same time voiced his yearning for Christian unity, the enthusiasm among Catholic and Protestant ecumenicists was immediate.
With good reason it appeared that a new day was upon divided Christendom.
But as the more concrete plans for the work of the Council gradually became known, there was a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all sides.
The Council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affairs of the Church.
As it has turned out, however, the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second were both wrong responses.
Two things have happened in recent months to bring the Council into perspective : each provides a basis for renewed hope and joy.
First of all, it is now known that Pope John sees the renewal and purification of the Church as an absolutely necessary step toward Christian unity.
Far from being irrelevant to the ecumenical task, the Pontiff believes that a revivified Church is required in order that the whole world may see Catholicism in the best possible light.
Equally significant, Pope John has said that Catholics themselves bear some responsibility for Christian disunity.
A major aim of the Council will be to remove as far as possible whatever in the Church today stands in the way of unity.
Secondly, a whole series of addresses and actions by the Pope and by others show that concern for Christian unity is still very much alive and growing within the Church.
The establishment, by the Holy Father, of a permanent Secretariat for Christian Unity in 1960 was the most dramatic mark of this concern.
The designation of five Catholic theologians to attend the World Council of Churches assembly in New Delhi as official observers reverses the Church's earlier stand.
The public appeal by the new Vatican Secretary of State, Cardinal Cicognani, for renewed efforts toward Eastern and Western reunion was still another remarkable act.
Nor can one forget Pope John's unprecedented meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury.
Augustin Cardinal Bea, the director of the Secretariate for Christian Unity, has expressed as directly as anyone the new spirit that pervades the Church's stance toward the Protestant and Orthodox Churches.
Noting all the difficulties that stand in the way of reunion, he has said that they ought not to discourage anyone.
For discouragement, or the temptation to abandon our efforts, would show that one placed excessive trust in purely human means without thinking of the omnipotence of God, the irresistible efficacy of prayer, the action of Christ or the power of the Divine Spirit.
Can any Christian fail to respond to these words?
The budget deficit the administration's official budget review, which estimates a 6.9 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year, isn't making anyone happy.
Certainly it isn't making the President happy, and he has been doing his apologetic best to explain how the budget got into its unbalanced condition, how he intends to economize wherever he can and how he hopes to do better next year.
We sympathize with Mr. Kennedy, but we feel bound to say that his budget review doesn't please us either, although for very different reasons.
Furthermore, we find his defense of the unbalanced budget more dismaying than reassuring.
In the first place, a large part of the discrepancy between President Eisenhower's estimate of a 1.5 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit is the result of the outgoing President's farewell gift of a political booby-trap to his successor.
The Eisenhower budget was simultaneously inadequate in its provisions and yet extravagant in its projections of revenue to be received.
The rest of the deficit is also easily understood.
Four billion dollars of the spending increase is for defense, an expenditure necessitated by the penny-wise policies of the Eisenhhower Administration, quite apart from the recent crises in Berlin and elsewhere.
Four hundred million dollars of the increase is for the expanded space program, a responsibility similarly neglected by Mr. Eisenhower.
The farm program will cost an additional 1.5 billion, because of unusual weather factors, the Food for Peace program and other new measures.
Anti-recession programs -- aid for the unemployed, their children and for depressed areas -- account for only 900 million of the 6.9 billion dollar deficit.
Our complaint is that in many crucial areas the Kennedy programs are not too large but too small, most seriously in regard to the conventional arms build-up and in aid and welfare measures.
And yet Mr. Kennedy persists in trying to mollify the intransigents of the right with apologies and promises of tightening up and economizing.
We wish the President would remember that fiscal responsibility was the battle-cry of the party that lost the election.
The party that won used to say something about a New Frontier.
Ethics and peace introduction of the dialogue principle proved strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meeting of the Catholic Association for International Peace in Washington the last weekend in October.
Two of the principal addresses were delivered by prominent Protestants, and when the speaker was a Catholic, one discussant on the dais tended to be of another religious persuasion.
Several effects were immediately evident.
Sessions devoted to Ethics and Foreign Policy Trends, Moral Principle and Political Judgment, Christian Ethics in the Cold War and related subjects proved to be much livelier under this procedure than if Catholics were merely talking to themselves.
Usually questions from the floor were directed to the non-*catholic speaker or discussion leader.
In the earlier sessions there was plentiful discussion on the natural law, which Dr. William V. O'*brien of Georgetown University, advanced as the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgments on foreign policy.
That Aristotelean-*thomistic principle experienced a thorough going-over from a number of the participants, but in the end the concept came to reassert itself.
Speakers declared that Protestants often make use of it, if, perhaps, by some other name.
A Lebanese Moslem told about its existence and application in the Islamic tradition as the divine law, while a C.*a.*i.*p. member who has been working in close association with delegates of the new U.*n. nations told of its widespread recognition on the African continent.
The impression was unmistakable that, whatever one may choose to call it, natural law is a functioning generality with a certain objective existence.
Another question that arose was the nature of the dialogue itself.
The stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical systems involving certain differences was undeniable.
It was expected that the comparison of different approaches to ethics would produce a better grasp of each other's positions and better comprehension of one's own.
But a realization that each group has much of substance to learn from the other also developed, and a strong conviction grew that each had insights and dimensions to contribute to ethically acceptable solutions of urgent political issues.
One effect of the spirited give-and-take of these discussions was to focus attention on practical applications and the necessity of being armed with the facts : knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiniest tactical atomic weapon would have a bearing on judgments as to the advisability of its use -- to defend Berlin, for example ; the pervasive influence of ideology on our political judgments needs to be recognized and taken into due account ; it is necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demanded by the Christian imperative.
Everywhere I went in Formosa I asked the same question.
I was searching for an accent of self-delusion or, even, of hypocrisy.
I never found it among any of the Chinese with whom I spoke, though granted they were, almost all, members of the official family who, presumably, harbor official thoughts.
But I questioned, also, professional soldiers, who would not easily be hypnotized by a septuagenarian's dreamy irredentism.
Their answer was : it can be done, and we will do it.
And then I put the question as pointedly as I could directly to Chiang Kai-shek : in America, I said, practically no one believes that you subjectively intend to re-enter the Mainland.
What evidence is there of an objective kind that in fact your government proposes to do just that, and that it can be done?
He smiled.
( he always smiles -- at least at visitors, I gather.
He smiled also at a British bloke seated next to me, who asked the most asinine questions.
I recalled sympathetically the Duke's complaint in Browning's My Last Duchess.
) he smiled, and said a word or two to the interpreter, who turned to me, the President wonders where you are going after you leave Taipei?
That, I smarted, is a royal rebuff if ever there was one.
I answered the routine question about my itinerary, rather coolly.
Chiang spoke again, this time at greater length.
The President says, the translator came in, that the reason he asked you where you were going is because he hoped you would be visiting other areas in Southeast Asia, and that everywhere you went, you would seek the answer to your question.
He says that if he were to express to you, once again, his own profound determination to go to the Mainland, and his faith that that return is feasible, he would merely sound redundant.
So you yourself must seek these objective data, and come to your own conclusions.
Any information we have here in Taiwan is at your disposal.
Fair enough.
What are the relevant data?
For every person on Taiwan, there are sixty in Mainland China.
If the raw population figures are crucially relevant, then it is idle to think of liberation, as idle as to suppose that Poland might liberate Russia.
Relative military manpower?
Less than 60-1, but at least 6-1.
The estimates vary widely on the strength of the Chinese army.
Say four million.
The armed forces of Taiwan are at a working strength of about 450,000, though a reserve potential twice that high is contemplated.
Skill?
Training?
Morale?
It is generally conceded that the Formosan air force is the best by far in Asia, and the army the best trained.
The morale is very high.
Even so, it adds up to impossible odds, except that the question arises, on whose side would the Mainland Chinese army fight?
The miserable people of China, the largest cast ever conscripted to enact an ideological passion play, cannot themselves resist overtly.
They think, perforce, of physical survival : everything else is secondary.
But the army which Mao continues to feed well, where are its sympathies?
The psychological strategists in Taiwan stress the great sense of family, cultivated in China over thousands of years.
It has not been extirpated by ten years of Communist depersonalization.
Every soldier in the army has, somewhere, relatives who are close to starvation.
The soldiers themselves cannot stage a successful rebellion, it is assumed : but will their discontent spread to the officer class?
The immediate families of the generals and the admirals are well fed : a despot does not economize on his generals.
But there are the cousins and aunts and nephews.
Their privations are almost beyond endurance.
In behalf of what?
Leninism-*marxism, as understood by Exegete Mao.
To whom will the generals stay loyal?
There is little doubt if they had a secret ballot, they would vote for food for their family, in place of ideological purity out on the farm.
It is another question whether they -- or a single general, off in a corner of China, secure for a few ( galvanizing?
) days at least from instant retaliation -- will defy the Party.
But the disposition to rebel is most definitely there.
But there must be a catalytic pressure.
The military in Taiwan believe that the Communists have made two mistakes, which, together, may prove fatal.
The first was the commune program, which will ensure agricultural poverty for years.
The family is largely broken up ; and where it is not, it is left with no residue, and the social meaning of this is enormous.
For it is the family that, in China, has always provided social security for the indigent, the sick, the down-and-out members of the clan.
Now the government must do that ; but the government is left with no reserve granary, under the agricultural system it has ordained.
Thus the government simultaneously undertook the vast burden of social security which had traditionally been privately discharged, and created a national scarcity which has engendered calamitous problems of social security.
The second mistake is Tibet.
Tibet has historically served China as a buffer state.
A friendly state, sometimes only semi-independent, but never hostile.
China never tried to integrate Tibet by extirpating the people's religion and institutions.
Red China is trying to do this, and she is not likely ever to succeed.
Tibet is too vast, the terrain is too difficult.
Tibet may bleed China as Algeria is bleeding France.
These continuing pressures, social, economic and military, are doing much to keep China in a heightening state of tension.
The imposition of yet another pressure, a strong one, from the outside, might cause it to snap.
The planners in Taiwan struck me as realistic men.
They know that they must depend heavily on factors outside their own control.
First and foremost, they depend on the inhuman idiocies of the Communist regime.
On these they feel they can rely.
Secondly, they depend on America's moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrives.
They hope that if history vouchsafes the West another Budapest, we will receive the opportunity gladly.
I remarked jocularly to the President that the future of China would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of selected American Liberals to Quemoy on an odd day.
He affected ( most properly ) not to understand my point.
But he -- and all of China -- wears the scars of American indecisiveness, and he knows what an uncertain ally we are.
We have been grand to Formosa itself -- lots of aid, and, most of the time, a policy of support for the offshore islands.
But our outlook has been, and continues to be, defensive.
A great deal depends on the crystallization of Mr. Kennedy's views on the world struggle.
The Free Chinese know that the situation on the Mainland is in flux, and are poised to strike.
There is not anywhere on the frontiers of freedom a more highly mobilized force for liberation.
The moment of truth is the moment of crisis.
During the slow buildup, the essence of a policy or a man is concealed under embroidered details, fine words, strutting gestures.
The crisis burns these suddenly away.
There the truth is, open to eyes that are willing to look.
The moment passes.
New self-deceiving rags are hurriedly tossed on the too-naked bones.
A truth-revealing crisis erupted in Katanga for a couple of days this month, to be quickly smothered by the high pressure verbal fog that is kept on tap for such emergencies.
Before memory, too, clouds over, let us make a note or two of what could be seen.
The measure was instantly taken, as always in such cases, of public men at many levels.
One knows better, now, who has bone and who has jelly in his spine.
But I am here concerned more with policy than with men.
Public men come and go but great issues of policy remain.
Now, everyone knows -- or knew in the week of December 10 -- that something had gone shockingly wrong with American foreign policy.
The United States was engaged in a military attack on a peaceful, orderly people governed by a regime that had proved itself the most pro-*western and anti-*communist within any of the new nations -- the only place in Africa, moreover, where a productive relationship between whites and blacks had apparently been achieved.
Of course the fighting was officially under the auspices of the United Nations.
But in the moment of truth everyone could see that the U.*s. was in reality the principal.
The moment simultaneously revealed that in the crisis our policy ran counter to that of all our *j allies, to the entire Western community.
By our policy the West was -- is -- split.
But the key revelation is not new.
The controlling pattern was first displayed in the Hungary-*suez crisis of November 1956.
It reappears, in whole or part, whenever a new crisis exposes the reality : in Cuba last spring ( with which the Dominican events of last month should be paired ) ; at the peaks of the nuclear test and the Berlin cycles ; in relation to Laos, Algeria, South Africa ; right now, with almost cartoon emphasis, in the temporally linked complex of Tshombe-*gizenga-*goa-*ghana.
What the moments reveal this prime element of the truth may be stated as follows : under prevailing policy, the U.*s. can take the initiative against the Right, but cannot take the initiative against the Left.
It makes no difference what part of the world is involved, what form of regime, what particular issue.
The U.*s. cannot take the initiative against the Left.
There is even some question whether the U.*s. can any longer defend itself against an initiative by the Left.
We can attack Tshombe, but not Gigenza.
No matter that Gizenga is Moscow's man in the Congo.
No matter that it is his troops who rape Western women and eat Western men.
No matter that the Katanga operation is strategically insane in terms of Western interests in Africa.
( even granted that the Congo should be unified, you don't protect Western security by first removing the pro-*western weight from the power equilibrium.
) we can force Britain and France out of the Suez, but we cannot so much as try to force the Russian tanks back from Budapest.
We can mass our fleet against the Trujillos, but not against the Castros.
We can vote in the *j against South African apartheid or Portuguese rule in Angola, but we cannot even introduce a motion on the Berlin Wall -- much less, give the simple order to push the Wall down.
We officially receive the anti-*french, Moscow-allied Algerian *j, but we denounce the pro-*europe, anti-*communist *j as criminal.
In the very week of our war against Katanga, we make a $133 million grant to Kwame Nkrumah, who has just declared his solidarity with the Communist bloc, and is busily turning his own country into a totalitarian dictatorship.
As our planes land the war materiel that kills pro-*western Katangans, we stand supinely bleating while Nehru's troops smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of our *j ally, Portugal.
What explains this uni-directional paralysis?
It is the consequence of the system of ideas that constitutes the frame of our international -- and in some degree our domestic -- policy.
The Suez-*hungary crisis proves that this system was not invented by the new Administration, but only made more consistent and more active.
Key to the puzzles most immediately relevant to these episodes in Goa, Katanga and Ghana, as to the Suez-*hungary crisis before them, is the belief that the main theater of the world drama is the underdeveloped region of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
From this belief is derived the practical orientation of our policy on the uncommitted ( neutralist, contested ) nations, especially on those whose leaders make the most noise -- Nehru, Tito, Nkrumah, Sukarno, Betancourt, etc..
Our chief aim becomes that of finding favor in neutralist eyes.
If we grasp this orientation as a key, our national conduct in all of the events here mentioned becomes intelligible.
And it becomes clear why in general we cannot take the initiative against the Left.
Broadway the unoriginals to write a play, the dramatist once needed an idea plus the imagination, the knowledge of life and the craft to develop it.
Nowadays, more and more, all he needs is someone else's book.
To get started, he does not scan the world about him ; he and his prospective producer just read the bestseller lists.
So far this season, Broadway's premieres have included twice as many adaptations and imports as original American stage plays.
Best from abroad.
Of straight dramas, there are All The Way Home, which owes much of its poetic power to the James Agee novel, A Death In The Family ; The Wall, awkwardly based on the John Hersey novel ; Advise And Consent, lively but shallow theater drawn from the mountainously detailed bestseller ; Face Of A Hero ( closed ), based on a Pierre Boulle novel.
The only original works attempting to reach any stature : Tennessee Williams' disappointing domestic comedy, Period Of Adjustment, and Arthur Laurents' clever but empty Invitation To A March.
Clearly the most provocative plays are all imported originals -- A Taste Of Honey, by Britain's young ( 19 when she wrote it ) Shelagh Delaney ; Becket, by France's Jean Anouilh ; The Hostage ( closed ), by Ireland's Brendan Behan.
Among the musicals, Camelot came from T. H. White's The Once And Future King, and novels were the sources of the less than momentous Tenderloin and Do Re Mi.
Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were originals, but pretty bad, leaving top honors again to an import -- the jaunty and charmingly French Irma La Douce.
The only other works at least technically original were dreary farces -- Send Me No Flowers ( closed ), Under The Yum-*yum Tree, Critic's Choice.
In the forthcoming The Conquering Hero and Carnival, Broadway is not even adapting books, but reconverting old movies ( Hail The Conquering Hero and Lili ).
Dry of life.
Originals are not necessarily good and adaptations are not necessarily bad.
Some memorable plays have been drawn from books, notably Life With Father and Diary Of Anne Frank.
And particularly in the musical field, adaptations have long been the rule, from Die Fledermaus and The Merry Widow to Oklahoma and My Fair Lady.
As critic Walter Kerr points out : adaptations, so long as they are good, still qualify as creative.
And other defenders invariably argue that, after all, Shakespeare and Moliere were adapters too.
The difference is that the masters took the bare frame of a plot and filled it with their own world ; most modern adapters totally accept the world of a book, squeeze it dry of life, and add only one contribution of their own : stage technique.
The most frequent excuse for the prevalence of unoriginals and tested imports is increasing production expense -- producers cannot afford to take chances.
But that explanation is only partly true.
Off-*broadway, where production is still comparatively cheap, is proving itself only slightly more original.
Laudably enough, it is offering classics and off-beat imports, but last week only one U.*s. original was on the boards, Robert D. Hock's stunning Civil War work, Borak.
The real trouble seems to be the failing imagination of U.*s. playwrights.
Nightclubs the Cooch Terpers he : come with me to the Casbah.
She : by subway or cab?
That exchange was not only possible but commonplace last week in Manhattan, as more and more New Yorkers were discovering 29th Street and Eighth Avenue, where half a dozen small nightclubs with names like Arabian Nights, Grecian Palace and Egyptian Gardens are the American inpost of belly dancing.
Several more will open soon.
Their burgeoning popularity may be a result of the closing of the 52nd Street burlesque joints, but curiously enough their atmosphere is almost always familial -- neighborhood saloons with a bit of epidermis.
The belly boites, with their papier-mache palm trees or hand-painted Ionic columns, heretofore existed mainly on the patronage of Greek and Turkish families.
Customers often bring their children ; between performances, enthusiastic young men from the audience will take the floor to demonstrate their own amateur graces.
Except for the odd uptown sex maniac or an overeager Greek sailor, the people watch in calm absorption.
Small, shirt-sleeved orchestras play in 2/4 or 4/4 time, using guitars, violins, and more alien instruments with names that would open Sesame : the oud, grandfather of the lute ; the darbuka, a small drum with the treelike shape of a roemer glass ; the def, a low-pitched tambourine.
The girls sit quietly with the musicians, wearing prim dresses or plain, secretarial shifts, until it is time to go off to a back room and reappear in the spare uniform of the harem.
Continuum of mankind.
If a dancer is good, she suggests purely and superbly the fundamental mechanics of ancestry and progeny -- the continuum of mankind.
But a great many of what Variety calls the Cooch Terpers are considerably less cosmic than that.
Each dancer follows the ancient Oriental pattern -- she glides sideways with shoulders motionless while her stomach migrates, and, through breathing and muscle control, she sends ripples across her body to the fingertips and away to the far end of the room.
This is done at varying speeds, ranging from the slow and fast Shifte Telli ( a musical term meaning double strings ) to the fastest, ecstatic Karshilama ( meaning greetings or welcome ).
The New York dancers are highly eclectic, varying the pattern with all kinds of personal improvisations, back bends or floor crawls.
But they do not strip.
The striptease is crass ; the belly dance leaves more to the imagination.
When a dancer does well, she provokes a quiet bombardment of dollar bills -- although the Manhattan clubs prohibit the more cosmopolitan practice of slipping the tips into the dancers' costumes.
With tips, the girls average between $150 and $200 a week, depending on basic salary.
Although they are forbidden to sit with the customers, the dancers are sometimes proffered drinks, and most of them can bolt one down in mid-shimmy.
The melting pot.
All over the country, belly clubs have never been bigger, especially in Detroit, Boston and Chicago, and even in small towns ; one of the best dancers, a Turkish girl named Semra, works at a roadhouse outside Bristol, Conn..
The girls are kept booked and moving by several agents, notably voluble, black-bearded Murat Somay, a Manhattan Turk who is the Sol Hurok of the central abdomen.
He can offer nine Turkish girls, plans to import at least 15 more.
But a great many of the dancers are more or less native.
Sometimes they get their initial experience in church haflis, conducted by Lebanese and Syrians in the U.*s., where they dance with just as few veils across their bodies as in nightclubs.
As the girls come to belly dancing from this and other origins, the melting pot has never bubbled more intriguingly.
Some Manhattan examples : Jemela ( surname : Gerby ), 23, seems Hong Kong Oriental but has a Spanish father and an Indian mother, was born in America and educated at Holy Cross Academy and Textile High School, says she learned belly dancing at family picnics.
Serene ( Mrs. Wilson ), 23, was born in Budapest and raised in Manhattan.
Daughter of a gypsy mother who taught her to dance, she is one of the few really beautiful girls in the New York Casbah, with dark eyes and dark, waist-length hair, the face of an adolescent patrician and a lithe, glimmering body.
Many belly dancers are married, but Serene is one of the few who will admit it.
Marlene ( surname : Adamo ), 25, a Brazilian divorcee who learned the dance from Arabic friends in Paris, now lives on Manhattan's West Side, is about the best belly dancer working the Casbah, loves it so much that she dances on her day off.
She has the small, highly developed body of a prime athlete, and holds in contempt the girls who just move sex.
Leila ( Malia Phillips ), 25, is a Greenwich Village painter of Persianesque miniatures who has red hair that cascades almost to her ankles.
A graduate of Hollywood High School, she likes to imagine herself, as she takes the floor, a village girl coming in to a festival.
Gloria ( surname : Ziraldo ), circa 30, who was born in Italy and once did chorus work in Toronto, has been around longer than most of the others, wistfully remembers the old days when we used to get the seamen from the ships, you know, with big turtleneck sweaters and handkerchiefs and all.
But the ships are very slow now, and we don't get so many sailors any more.
The uptown crowd has moved in, and what girl worth her seventh veil would trade a turtleneck sweater for a button-down collar?
A short, tormented span of the handful of painters that Austria has produced in the 20th century, only one, Oskar Kokoschka, is widely known in the U.*s..
This state of unawareness may not last much longer.
For ten years a small group of European and U.*s. critics has been calling attention to the half-forgotten Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele, who died 42 years ago at the age of 28.
The critics' campaign finally inspired the first major U.*s. exhibit of Schiele's works.
The show has been to Boston and Manhattan, will in time reach Pittsburgh and Minneapolis.
Last week it opened at the J. B. Speed Museum in Louisville, at the very moment that a second Schiele exhibit was being made ready at the Felix Landau gallery in Los Angeles.
Schiele's paintings are anything but pleasant.
His people ( see color ) are angular and knobby-knuckled, sometimes painfully stretched, sometimes grotesquely foreshortened.
His colors are dark and murky, and his landscapes and cityscapes seem swallowed in gloom.
But he painted some of the boldest and most original pictures of his time, and even after nearly half a century, the tense, tormented world he put on canvas has lost none of its fascination.
The devil himself.
The son of a railway stationmaster, Schiele lived most of his childhood in the drowsy Danubian town of Tulln, 14 miles northwest of Vienna.
He was an emotional, lonely boy who spent so much time turning out drawings that he did scarcely any schoolwork.
When he was 15, his parents finally allowed him to attend classes at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.
Even there he did not last for long.
Cried one professor after a few months of Student Schiele's tantrums and rebellion : the devil himself must have defecated you into my classroom ] for a while his work was influenced deeply by the French impressionists, and by the patterned, mosaic-like paintings of Gustav Klimt, then the dean of Austrian art.
Gradually Schiele evolved a somber style of his own -- and he had few inhibitions about his subject matter.
His pictures were roundly denounced as the most disgusting things one has ever seen in Vienna.
He himself was once convicted of painting erotica and jailed for 24 days -- the first three of which he spent desperately trying to make paintings on the wall with his own spittle.
For years he wore hand-me-down suits and homemade paper collars, was even driven to scrounging for cigarette butts in Vienna's gutters.
Drafted into the Austrian army, he rebelliously rejected discipline, wangled a Vienna billet, went on painting.
It was not until the last year of his life that he had his first moneymaking show.
Melancholy obsession.
The unabashed sexuality of so many of his paintings was not the only thing that kept the public at bay : his view of the world was one of almost unrelieved tragedy, and it was too much even for morbid-minded Vienna.
He was obsessed by disease and poverty, by the melancholy of old age and the tyranny of lust.
The children he painted were almost always in rags, his portraits were often ruthless to the point of ugliness, and his nudes -- including several self-portraits -- were stringy, contorted and strangely pathetic.
The subject he liked most was the female body, which he painted in every state -- naked, half-dressed, muffled to the ears, sitting primly in a chair, lying tauntingly on a bed or locked in an embrace.
The most surprising thing about the Twenty-second Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is that it is surprising -- perhaps quite as much, in its own way, as the Twentieth Congress of 1956, which ended with that famous secret report on Stalin.
The publication last July of the party's Draft Program -- that blueprint for the transition to communism -- had led the uninitiated to suppose that this Twenty-second Congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the Khrushchev regime, a solemn consecration of ideas which had, in fact, been current over the last three or four years ( i.e., since the defeat of the anti-party group ) in all theoretical party journals.
These never ceased to suggest that if, in the eyes of Marx and Lenin full communism was still a very distant ideal, the establishment of a Communist society had now, under Khrushchev, become an immediate and tangible reality.
It seems that Khrushchev himself took a very special pride in having made a world-shaking contribution to Marxist doctrine with his Draft Program ( a large part of his twelve-hour speech at the recent Congress was, in fact, very largely a rehash of that interminable document ).
He and other Soviet leaders responsible for the document were proud of having brought forward some new formulas, such as the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an All People's State, and also of having laid down the lines for a much greater democratization of the whole hierarchy of Soviets, starting with the Supreme Soviet itself.
Their plan for rotation of leaders promised a salutary blow at bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct and active part in running the country.
Also, elections would be more democratic ; there might even be two or more candidates for voters to choose from.
No doubt, there was still a lot in the Draft Program -- and in Khrushchev's speech -- which left many points obscure.
Was it the party's intention, for example, to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes, i.e., state farms ( which were, moreover, to be progressively urbanized )?
As we know, the Soviet peasant today still very largely thrives on being able to sell the produce grown on his private plot ; and it is still very far from certain how valid the party's claim is that in a growing number of kolkhozes the peasants are finding it more profitable, to surrender their private plots to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turned into something increasingly like a state farm.
If one follows the reports of the Congress, one finds that there still seems considerable uncertainty in the minds of the leaders themselves about what exactly to do in this matter.
The Draft Program was interesting in other respects, too.
It contained, for example, a number of curious admissions about the peasants, who enjoy no sickness benefits, no old-age pensions, no paid holidays ; they still benefit far less than the other 50 per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the Soviet Union so greatly prides itself on being.
Over all these fairly awkward problems Khrushchev was to skate rather lightly ; and, though he repeated, over and over again, the spectacular figures of industrial and agricultural production in 1980, the ordinary people in Russia are still a little uncertain as to how communism is really going to work in practice, especially in respect of food.
Would agriculture progress as rapidly as industry?
This was something on which K. himself seemed to have some doubts ; for he kept on threatening that he would pull the ears of those responsible for agricultural production.
And, as we know, the Virgin Lands are not producing as much as Khrushchev had hoped.
One cannot but wonder whether these doubts about the success of Khrushchev's agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprises provided by this Congress -- the obsessive harping on the crimes and misdeeds of the anti-party group -- Molotov, Malenkov, Kaganovich and others -- including the eighty-year-old Marshal Voroshilov.
Molotov, in particular, is being charged with all kinds of sins -- especially with wanting to cut down free public services, to increase rents and fares ; in fact, with having been against all the more popular features of the Khrushchev welfare state.
The trouble with all these doctrinal quarrels is that we hear only one side of the story : what, in the secret councils of the Kremlin, Molotov had really proposed, we just don't know, and he has had no chance to reply.
But one cannot escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harping on the misdeeds of the long liquidated anti-party group would be totally unnecessary if there were not, inside the party, some secret but genuine opposition to Khrushchev on vital doctrinal grounds, on the actual methods to be employed in the transition to communism and, last but not least, on foreign policy.
The whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with the capitalist world is in the very center of this Congress.
Mikoyan declared : Molotov altogether rejects the line of peaceful coexistence, reducing this concept merely to the state of peace or rather, the absence of war at a given moment, and to a denial of the possibility of averting a world war.
His views, in fact, coincide with those of foreign enemies of peaceful coexistence, who look upon it merely as a variant of the cold war or of an armed peace.
One cannot help wondering whether Molotov and the rest of the anti-party group are not being used as China's whipping-boys by Khrushchev and his faithful followers.
For something, clearly, has gone very, very seriously wrong in Soviet-*chinese relations, which were never easy, and have now deteriorated.
The effect of Chou En-lai's clash with Khrushchev, together with the everlasting attacks on Molotov & Co., has shifted the whole attention of the world, including that of the Soviet people, from the epoch-making twenty-year program to the present Soviet-*chinese conflict.
Not only, as we know, did Chou En-lai publicly treat Khrushchev's attack on Albania as something that we cannot consider as a serious Marxist-*leninist approach to the problem ( i.e., as something thoroughly dictatorial and undemocratic ), but the Albanian leaders went out of their way to be openly abusive to Khrushchev, calling him a liar, a bully, and so on.
It is extremely doubtful that the handful of Albanians who call themselves Communists could have done this without the direct approval of their Chinese friends.
The big question is whether, in the name of a restored Chinese-*soviet solidarity, the Chinese will choose to persuade the Albanians to present their humble apologies to Khrushchev -- or get rid of Enver Hoxa.
These seem about the only two ways in which the unhappy incident can now be closed.
But Albania is merely a symptom of a real malaise between China and Russia.
There are other symptoms.
Khrushchev, for all his bombastic prophecies about the inevitable decay of capitalism, is genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence and would like, above all, the Berlin and German problems to be settled peacefully ; he knows that he was never more popular than at the time of the Russo-*american honeymoon of 1959.
But it seems that pressures against him are coming from somewhere -- in the first place from China, but perhaps also from that China Lobby which, I was assured in Moscow nearly two years ago, exists on the quiet inside the party.
To these people, solidarity and unity with China should be the real basis of Russia's future policy.
And the Chinese, as the Albanian incident shows, have strong suspicions that Khrushchev is anxious to secure a shameful peace with the West.
The fact that China ( which is obsessed by Formosa -- to Khrushchev a very small matter ) should be supported by North Korea and North Vietnam is highly indicative.
And one cannot but wonder whether Marshal Malinovsky, who was blowing hot and cold, exalting peace but also almost openly considering the possibility of preventive war against the West, wasn't trying to keep the Chinese quiet.
And this brings us inevitably to the 30- or 50-megaton bomb.
Was not this dropped primarily in order to appease the Chinese -- especially after Khrushchev's humiliating surrender to the West in canceling the German peace-treaty deadline of December 31?
What does it all add up to?
Indications are that Khrushchev ( and, with him, the bulk of the Soviet people ) favor peaceful coexistence and ( with the exception of Berlin ) the maintenance of the status quo in the world.
The Chinese, North Vietnamese and North Koreans, on the other hand, feel that, militarily, Russia is strong enough to support them in the just wars of liberation they would like to embark on before long : with China attacking Formosa and the North Koreans and North Vietnamese liberating the southern half of their respective countries.
Perhaps Khrushchev is in a more difficult position than any since 1957, when the anti-party group nearly liquidated him.
He seems strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition ; but if he is up against China's crusading spirit in world affairs, he is going to be faced with the most agonizing choice in his life.
He may support China ( but he won't ) ; he may break with China ( which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous ), or he may succeed, by all kinds of dangerous concessions, in persuading China to be patient.
The next days may show where things stand.
On a misty Sunday morning last month, a small band of militant anti-*communists called the Minutemen held maneuvers in a foggy field about fifteen miles east of here.
Eleven men, a woman and a teen-age boy tramped over cold, damp, fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problems of guerrilla warfare.
To the average American, this must sound like an incredible tale from a Saturday night *j movie.
But to the Minutemen, this is a serious business.
They feel that the United States is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy.
They feel that World War 3 has already begun, and they are setting themselves up as a last line of defense against the Communist advance.
Their national leader, Robert Bolivar De*pugh of Norborne, Mo., says the Minutemen believe that guerrilla tactics are best suited to defeat the Red onslaught.
In their maneuvers last month, they wore World War 2 camouflage garb and helmets, and carried unloaded *j rifles.
The maneuvers were held in secret after a regional seminar for the Minutemen, held in nearby Shiloh, Ill., had been broken up the previous day by deputy sheriffs, who had arrested regional leader Richard Lauchli of Collinsville, Ill., and seized four operative weapons, including a Browning machine gun, two Browning automatic rifles and an *j rifle.
Undismayed by this contretemps, a small band of the faithful gathered at Lauchli's home at 6:30 A.*m. the next day, put on their uniforms, and headed for a farm several miles away.
A 60 mm. mortar and a 57 mm. recoilless rifle owned by Lauchli were brought along.
The mortar was equipped with dummy shells and the recoilless rifle was deactivated.
After a tortuous drive in an open truck and a World War 2 army jeep down soggy trails, the band arrived at a small clearing squeezed between a long, low ridge and a creek-filled gully.
Here the two leaders, De*pugh and Lauchli, hastened to put the group through its paces.
The Minutemen were instructed in the use of terrain for concealment.
They were shown how to advance against an enemy outpost atop a cleared ridge.
They practiced movement behind a smoke screen laid by smoke grenades ; and they attempted a skirmish line of advance against a camouflaged enemy encampment.
Eleven dummy rounds were fired by Lauchli in a demonstration of rapid-fire mortar shooting.
Mrs. De*pugh, the mother of five children and an active member of her husband's organization, participated in all the exercises.
There were no casualties, but the guerrillas admitted to being a little tired when the leaders called a halt at 9 A.*m. to enable out-of-town members to catch a plane.
Tenure as criterion I would like to add one more practical reform to those mentioned by Russell Kirk ( Dec. 16 ).
It has to do with teachers' salaries and tenure.
Next September, after receiving a degree from Yale's Master of Arts in Teaching Program, I will be teaching somewhere -- that much is guaranteed by the present shortage of mathematics teachers.
I will also be underpaid.
The amazing thing is that this too is caused by the dearth of teachers.
Teaching is at present a sellers' market ; as a result buyers, the public, must be satisfied with second-rate teachers.
But this is not the real problem ; the rub arises from the fact that teachers are usually paid on the basis of time served rather than quality.
Hence all teachers, good and bad, who have been teaching for a given number of years are paid the same salary.
I am firmly convinced that considering the average quality of teachers in this country, the profession is grossly overpaid.
It follows that teachers as a group cannot expect any marked salary increases ; there is a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance.
The only hope which good teachers have for being paid their due is to stop dragging the dead weight of poor teachers up the economic ladder with them.
The only hope which the public has for getting good teachers is to pay teachers on the basis of merit rather than tenure.
Here, as in all sectors of the economy, quality and justice are both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with his employer if he so chooses.
Loss of initiative on the eve of the great debate on the proposal to give the President broad powers to make across-the-board tariff concessions which could practically bring us into the Atlantic Community, we should face the alternatives on this proposition.
What we will be sacrificing in any such arrangement will be our power to be selective which is contained in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate.
Without this power we lay open any American industry which the Europeans may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of others.
It is this loss of initiative in how we conduct our economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct our political affairs.
A brief for the negative I disagree with Mr. Burnham's position on the Common Market ( Nov. 18 ) as a desirable organization for us to join.
For him to ignore the political consequences involved in an Atlantic Union of this kind is difficult to understand.
The pressure for our entry to the Common Market is mounting and we will proceed towards this amalgamated trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare, or garden path, with the political ramifications kept neatly in the background.
The appeal is going to be to the pocketbook and may be very convincing to those who do not see its relation to political and legal, as well as economic, self-rule.
In entering this union we will be surrendering most, if not all, of our economic autonomy to international bodies such as the Atlantic Institute ( recently set up ) or the O.*e.*c.*d., I.*m.*f. and others.
To think that we can merely relinquish our economic autonomy without giving up our political or legal autonomy is wishful thinking.
If it is not enough that all of our internationalist One Worlders are advocating that we join this market, I refer you to an article in the New York Times' magazine section ( Nov. 12, 1961 ), by Mr. Eric Johnston, entitled We Must Join The Common Market.
He says : it has swept aside petty nationalisms, age-old rivalries, and worn-out customs.
Referring to Britain, he says, we see a nation that traditionally values sovereignty above all else willing to give up its economy, placing this authority in Continental hands.
Since the goal of our international planners is a World Government, this Atlantic Community would mark a giant step in that direction for, once American economic autonomy is absorbed, a larger grouping is a question of time.
Frankly, it is being very cleverly done for, in a sense, they have us over a barrel.
Listen to what Mr. Johnston has to say : consider the savage wounds that isolationism would inflict.
We would lose our export markets and deny ourselves the imports we need.
We would be crippled by reduced output, industrial decline, widespread unemployment.
But the solution to this dilemma is not the incorporation of the United States into an Atlantic Community or economic empire, but merely what libertarians like Henry Hazlitt and Ludwig Von Mises have been arguing for years : an end to government regulations, an end to government competition in industry, and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry.
Create a free market here, give us a sound, debt-free money system, and we'll compete with anyone, Europe and Asia combined.
In short, get this governmental monstrosity off our backs and we won't have to worry about European competition or Communism either.
If we want to preserve our sovereignty, this is the way to do it ; not acquiesce to an international planning board.
If we go into this Common Market, we might just as well stop talking about Constitutional guarantees, Connally Amendments or, for that matter, conservatism in general.
We welcome this able brief for the negative as part of a many-sided discussion of the Atlantic Common Market which J*n*r will be continuing in our pages.

Mental telepathy?
The Peiping Chinese were the only major silver seller in the world markets who stopped selling the metal on Monday morning, November 27, anticipating by two days the announcement of the U.*s. Treasury that the pegged offering price will be removed.
A professor and the army in 1954 I was drafted and after serving two years honorably on active duty I was not required to participate in any further Army Reserve activities.
Now, more than five years later, I cannot in any realistic sense be called a trained soldier.
But, in spite of this, I, at present a man 31 years of age and a college professor, have been recalled by direction of the President to report on November 25th to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, for another twelve months of active duty as an *j 4 ( the equivalent of a *j ).
Today, seven years after the date of my initial induction as a draftee, I am Assistant Professor of Philosophy and Science at St. Michael's College.
For, after leaving the Army in 1956, I spent five years in graduate school first at Boston College and then at the University of Toronto.
This time, added to that which I had already spent in school prior to my induction in 1954, makes a total of twenty-two ( 22 ) years of education.
The possibility of recall into the Army is part of the price that a modern American has to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoys.
With this no loyal citizen can quarrel.
However, it seems axiomatic that the government has an obligation to exercise its mandate reasonably, equitably and with full regard for the disruptions which it inevitably causes.
In my own case, I submit that such reasonable and fair exercise is woefully lacking.
Taken back into the Army now as an *j 4, I am leaving 110 college students whose teacher I am.
( a wry sidelight on this is that most of my students have deferments from the draft in order to attend my classes.
) at this late date, it is impossible for St. Michael's College to find a suitable replacement for me.
Even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 my personal life is being totally disrupted for the second time for no very compelling reason -- I cannot help looking around at the black leather jacket brigades standing idly on the street corners and in the taverns of every American city and asking myself if our society has gone mad.
Mercenary : term of honor?
In news broadcasts I consistently hear the foreign volunteers fighting in the Katanga Army referred to as mercenaries.
This confuses me no end.
If the Hessian troops sent here willy-nilly by the Hessian Government to fight for England in the 1770's were mercenaries, what shall we call the *j troops sent to the Congo willy-nilly by their governments to fight for the United Nations?
If the *j troops are not mercenaries then the Hessians were not mercenaries either.
And if the foreigners fighting in the Katanga Army are mercenaries then Lafayette and Von Steuben were mercenaries too, as were also the members of the Lafayette Escadrille in the early part of World War 1 and of Chennault's Flying Tigers in the early days of World War 2.
Modern postal slogan it doesn't take a Gore Vidal to tell you what's wrong with Cherokee Textile's slogan ( Pitney-*bowes Objects, July 1 ).
It's an eighteenth-century negative, man ] suggest the following twenty-first-century amendment : by moving the term Republic to lower case, substituting the modern phrase, move ahead for the stodgy keep, and by using the Postmaster's name on every envelope ( in caps, of course, with the in spite as faded as possible ), the slogan cannot fail.
The impending death of Pope in the issue of March 5, 1960 you had an excellent editorial which said : on trial in Jakarta for having flown for the Indonesian anti-*communist insurgents, U.*s. pilot Alan Lawrence Pope boldly told the court that in supporting the freedom fighters, he was actually defending the sovereignty and independence of Indonesia.
Facing a prosecution which has demanded the death penalty, he said : I have participated in the war against Communism in Korea and at Dienbienphu, and I have helped in the evacuation of North Vietnamese to the free world.
I have done all this for the freedom of the individuals concerned and also for the states which have been threatened by Communist domination.
At least in Indonesia, Khrushchev found an American proud to be at total war with Communism ] since then nothing has happened to save the life of Pope.
I found recently a very small article in the New York Times : U.*s. Flier Loses Plea.
Indonesia Court Upholds Pope's Death Sentence.
Indonesia Military Supreme Court has confirmed the death sentence passed on Alan Lawrence Pope, an American pilot.
Pope was convicted last year of having aided North Celebes rebels by flying bombing missions.
He has been in prison since May, 1958, when his aircraft was shot down over Moluccas.
He may appeal to President Sukarno for clemency.
As we see, Pope may appeal to President Sukarno, Khrushchev's friend, for clemency.
This possibility is anything but reassuring.
The Eleanor Roosevelt Tractor Committee acts on behalf of the Cuban freedom fighters.
But who will act now and immediately to save the life of Alan Pope?
Are tractors available for him?
Does anybody think of saving the life of an anti-*communist American pilot?
An analogy a few days before I saw your mention of what Texas Liberals were doing to promote Louis Capet ( The Week, June 3 ), another analogy had occurred to me.
Consider this table : 1.
Louis 14 -- *j.
With no strong men and no parliament to dispute his will, he was the government.
2.
Regency -- Truman.
A dust-settling period of decadence and decline.
3.
Louis 15 -- Eisenhower.
He opened his mouth, said little, and thought not at all.
4.
Louis 16 -- Kennedy.
Not completely virtuous, but completely incompetent.
And Marie Antoinette -- Jacqueline Bouvier.
The beautiful and light-hearted.
5.
French Revolution -- conservative Revolution?
Truly, that Liberals should choose Louis 14 as a bogey-symbol of conservatism is grotesquely ironic, considering the Louis 14 character of their Grand Monarque, *j : not only in his accretion of absolute power and personal deification, ( le roi gouverne par lui meme ) but in the disastrous effects of his spending and war policies.
In defeating Louis Capet, John Tower's victory in Texas signals, once again, the end of the divine right of Liberalism.
Confrontation it seems to me that N.*c., in his editorial Confrontation ( *j, Mar. 25 ), has hit upon the real problem that bothers all of us in a complex world : how do we retain our personal relationship with those who suffer?
This affects us all intimately, and can leave us hopeless in the face of widespread distress.
I know of no other solution than the one N.*c. proposes -- to do what we can for each sufferer as he confronts us, hoping that this will spread beyond him to others at some time and some place.
Never have I seen this expressed so clearly and so sympathetically.
Thank you for the illustrated editorial Confrontation.
It is both great writing and profound religion.
N.*c. has said something important so well that this preacher will many times be tempted to quote the whole piece.
I feel that N.*c. hit the very core of our existence in the editorial Confrontation.
Personally, it meant a great deal ; my only hope is that it will be shared by many, many others.
Confrontation should fortify us all, whether in Southeast Asia or the U.*s..
Congratulations to N.*c. for successfully delving into the heart of the problems that face the Peace Corps.
I concur that it is necessary for Americans to have a confrontation of the situation existing in foreign lands.
It would be heartbreaking to see idealism, and hence effective leadership, thwarted by the poverty and hardship which young Americans will run into.
The editorial Confrontation was certainly direct in its appeal to those of us living here in America.
I personally gained strength from it.
Thanks for continuing to capture the attention and uncover so many areas of need in this amazing world.
N.*c.'s editorial Confrontation is a stunning piece of writing.
I would hope that Sargent Shriver will encourage everyone entering the Peace Corps to read it.
The important people to humanity are not the Khrushchevs and the Castros but the Schweitzers and the Dooleys, and the others like them whose names we will never know.
Editor's note : reprints of Confrontation will be included among the material to be distributed to members of the Peace Corps.
A Peace Corps official described the editorial as precisely the message we need to communicate to the men and women who will soon be Peace Corps volunteers.
Improper Bostonian?
F. L. Lucas's article in *j April 1 issue seemed to be a very fair and objective analysis of the New English Bible.
I certainly hope this will be the impression left in the minds of readers, rather than the comment by Cleveland Amory in his first of the month column.
It is blind, fundamentalist dogmatism to say, messing around with the King James version seems to us a perilous sport at best.
Facts in focus Lester Markel is on the right track in his article Interpretation Of Interpretation ( *j, Mar. 11 ).
The current stereotype of straight news reporting was probably invaluable in protecting the press and its readers from pollution by that combination of doctored fact, fancy, and personal opinion called yellow journalism which flourished in this country more than a generation ago.
We don't need this type of protection any more.
The public is now armed with sophistication and numerous competing media.
Besides, there are no longer enough corruptible journalists about.
The accepted method of writing news has two major liabilities.
First, it does not communicate.
A reporter restricted to the competing propaganda statements of both sides in a major labor dispute, for instance, is unable to tell his readers half of what he knows about the causes of the dispute.
Second, it subjects the news to distortion by the unscrupulous.
The charges by the late junior Senator from Wisconsin not only destroyed innocent people but misled the nation.
Yet the press was powerless to put these charges in perspective in its news columns.
Despite several years of front-page stories, the average citizen was unable to get a complete picture of Mc*carthy until he saw on the television screen what the reporters had been seeing all along but had no effective way of communicating.
The Senator had boxed them in with their own restrictions.
It seems to me the time has come for the American press to start experimenting with ways of reporting the news that will do a better job of communicating and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learned how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve their own ends.
The objective should be to provide a method of getting into print a higher percentage than is now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporters and editors.
Southern California blackout I would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concerning President Kennedy's activities, so far as Southern California is concerned.
You have on more than one occasion praised the idea of a televised press conference and the chance it gives the people to form intelligent opinions.
To begin with, the all-powerful Los Angeles Times does not publish a transcript of these press conferences.
I am sure that they did when Eisenhower was President.
Next, because of the time differential, the conferences come on the networks during the middle of the day.
Up until now, the networks have grudgingly run half-hour tapes at 5 P.*m. or sometimes 7 or 10:30 P.*m..
Even then, a few of the less interesting questions are edited out and glibly summarized by a commentator.
However, last night the tapes were not run at all during the evening hours and all we got on *j were a few snatches which Douglas Edwards and Huntley and Brinkley could squeeze into their programs.
This is no criticism of them, as they obviously cannot get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary.
The radio stations did run transcripts ( I thought ) during the evening hours.
However, by comparing the *j snatches, two different radio station re-runs, and the censored Los Angeles Times version, I found that the radio stations had edited out questions ( A*b*c removed the one regarding Laos ) or even a paragraph out of the middle of the President's answer.
I am interested to know he is getting mail from all over the country about the abuse he is being subjected to.
We out here don't see enough of the conference to know he is being abused.
I don't know if this is the situation in other parts of the country ; apparently it is not.
It also happened with the Inauguration, which was not re-run at all during the evening hours, and I wrote to the *j editor of the Times.
He did mention in his column the fact that he had received many letters about this and he himself did not understand the networks and the independent local stations' not doing this -- but nothing happened.
Can you bring the networks' attention to this?
For a college of propaganda I was interested in James Webb Young's Madison Avenue column in which he raised the question : do we Need a college of propaganda?
( *j, Feb. 11 ).
In my estimation, we definitely do ; and the sad part of it is that we had one, which was rounding into excellent shape, and we let it disintegrate and die.
During the war, we set up schools for the teaching of psychological warfare, which included the teaching of propaganda, both black and white and the various shades of grey in between.
We had a couple of schools in this country, the principal one being on the Marshall Field estate out in Lloyd's Neck.
There were also a couple in Canada, and several in England.
The English schools preceded ours, and by the time we got into it they had learned a lot about the techniques of propaganda and its teaching.
Four of us here in the United States attended, first as students, then as instructors, almost every one of these schools, in England, Canada, and the United States.
We set up the Lloyd's Neck school, worked out its curriculum, and taught there.
Toward the end of the war, we really felt that we had learned something about propaganda and how to teach it.
When the end did come, and the schools were disbanded and abandoned, we felt and hoped that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allowed to rust.
We hoped that its practitioners and teachers might be put on some sort of reserve list and called back for refresher courses each year or so.
Alas, no such thing happened.
There apparently is no school of propaganda or psychological warfare.
A study at the Pentagon and at the service academies revealed that nothing was being done there.
And not one of the four men who attended all the schools has ever been called on to apply any of his knowledge in any way.
Congratulations on the article Do We Need A College Of Propaganda?
This is one of the most constructive suggestions made in this critical field in years, and I certainly hope it sparks some action.
Let the media clean house, too many of us in public relations were flattered that Richard L. Tobin chose to devote his editorial in the March 11 Communications Supplement to the merger of the Public Relations Society of America and the American Public Relations Association.
Snow storm I was surprised and sorry to find in your issue of March 4 a long and detailed attack upon a book that had not yet been published.
Whether in his forthcoming book C. P. Snow commits the errors of judgment and of fact with which your heavily autobiographical critic charged him is important.
One should be able to get hold of the book at once.
But the attack was made from an advance copy.
If this practice should take root and spread, the man who submits a manuscript to a publisher will find himself reviewed before he is accepted and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality.
Editor's note : Sir Robert Watson-*watt wrote, on page 50 of S*r Research for 4 March 1961 : I have read an advance copy of the Snow book which is to be titled, Science And Government.
Until the work actually appears I am not privileged to analyze it publicly in detail.
But I have compared its text with already published commentaries on the 1960 series of Godkin lectures at Harvard, from which the book was derived, and I can with confidence challenge the gist of C. P. Snow's incautious tale.
Watson-*watt's remarks in S*r did not then, constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the Godkin Lectures.
Representatives of Harvard University Press, which is publishing the book this month of April, recognize and freely acknowledge that they invited such reaction by allowing Life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book's publication date.
The text of the book leaves a somewhat milder impression than the prepublication excerpt.
Sir Robert Watson-*watt's rebuttal of Sir Charles Snow's Godkin Lectures is marred throughout by too forceful a desire to defend Lindemann and apparently himself from Sir Charles' supposed falsehoods while stating those falsehoods in an unclear incoherent argument.
The article presents the reader with an absurdity at its beginning.
It calls the conclusion admitted valid by historians and military strategists alike a perverted conclusion.
Nonsense.
It submits an enthusiastic, impressionistic conception of Lindemann contributing another aspect of the man, but on no more authoritative basis than Sir Charles' account.
We are left to choose between the two Lindemanns.
The only fact that holds any weight in the article is the result of the tea party.
But we are to believe that Lindemann actively supported radar outside the Tizard Committee, and dissembling, discounted it inside?
If so, I would lean to Sir Charles' conception of the man.
I think it was a grave error to print the article at this time.
To the unfortunate people unable to attend the Godkin lectures it casts an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from reading it.
It is not news that Nathan Milstein is a wizard of the violin.
Certainly not in Orchestra Hall where he has played countless recitals, and where Thursday night he celebrated his 20th season with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, playing the Brahms Concerto with his own slashing, demon-ridden cadenza melting into the high, pale, pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlocks the heart of the music, or forever finds it closed.
There was about that song something incandescent, for this Brahms was Milstein at white heat.
Not the noblest performance we have heard him play, or the most spacious, or even the most eloquent.
Those would be reserved for the orchestra's great nights when the soloist can surpass himself.
This time the orchestra gave him some superb support fired by response to his own high mood.
But he had in Walter Hendl a willing conductor able only up to a point.
That is, when Mr. Milstein thrust straight to the core of the music, sparks flying, bow shredding, violin singing, glittering and sometimes spitting, Mr. Hendl could go along.
But Mr. Hendl does not go straight to any point.
He flounders and lets music sprawl.
There was in the Brahms none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist, orchestra and music to ultimate fusion.
So we had some dazzling and memorable Milstein, but not great Brahms.
The concert opened with another big romantic score, Schumann's Overture to Manfred, which suffered fate, this time with orchestral thrusts to the Byronic point to keep it afloat.
Hindemith's joust with Weber tunes was a considerably more serious misfortune, for it demands transluscent textures, buoyant rhythms, and astringent wit.
It got the kind of scrambled, coarsened performance that can happen to best of orchestras when the man with the baton lacks technique and style.
Bayreuth next summer the Bayreuth Festival opens July 23 with a new production of Tannhaeuser staged by Wieland Wagner, who is doing all the operas this time, and conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.
Sawalisch also conducts The Flying Dutch, opening July 24.
Parsifal follows July 25, with Hans Knappertsbusch conducting, and he also conducts Die Meistersinger, to be presented Aug. 8 and 12.
The Ring cycles are July 26, 27, 28 and 30, and Aug. 21, 22, 23 and 25.
Rudolf Kempe conducts.
No casts are listed, but Lotte Lehmann sent word that the Negro soprano, Grace Bumbry, will sing Venus in Tannhaeuser.
Remember how by a series of booking absurdities Chicago missed seeing the Bolshoi Ballet?
Remember how by lack of two big theaters Chicago missed the first visit of the Royal Danish Ballet?
Well, now we have two big theaters.
But barring a miracle, and don't hold your breath for it, Chicago will not see the Leningrad-*kirov Ballet, which stems from the ballet cradle of the Maryinsky and is one of the great companies of the world.
Before you let loose a howl saying we announced its coming, not once but several times, indeed we did.
The engagement was supposed to be all set for the big theater in Mc*cormick Place, which Sol Hurok, ballet booker extraordinary, considers the finest house of its kind in the country -- and of course he doesn't weep at the capacity, either.
It was all set.
Allied Arts Corporation first listed the Chicago dates as Dec. 4 thru 10.
Later the Hurok office made it Dec. 8 thru 17, a nice, long booking for the full repertory.
But if you keep a calendar of events, as we do, you noticed a conflict.
Allied Arts had booked Marlene Dietrich into Mc*cormick Place Dec. 8 and 9.
Something had to give.
Not La Dietrich.
Allied Arts then notified us that the Kirov would cut short its Los Angeles booking, fly here to open Nov. 28, and close Dec. 2.
Shorter booking, but still a booking.
We printed it.
A couple of days later a balletomane told me he had telephoned Allied Arts for ticket information and was told the newspapers had made a mistake.
So I started making some calls of my own.
These are the results.
The Kirov Ballet is firmly booked into the Shrine Auditorium, Los Angeles, Nov. 21 thru Dec. 4.
Not a chance of opening here Nov. 28 -- barring that miracle.
Then why not the juicy booking Hurok had held for us?
Well, Dietrich won't budge from Mc*cormick Place.
Then how about the Civic Opera House?
Well, Allied Arts has booked Lena Horne there for a week starting Dec. 4.
Queried about the impasse, Allied Arts said : better cancel the Kirov for the time being.
It's all up in the air again.
So the Kirov will fly back to Russia, minus a Chicago engagement, a serious loss for dance fans -- and for the frustrated bookers, cancellation of one of the richest bookings in the country.
Will somebody please reopen the Auditorium?
Paintings and drawings by Marie Moore of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, are shown thru Nov. 5 at the Meadows Gallery, 3211 Ellis Av., week days, 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., Sundays 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., closed Mondays.
An exhibition of Evelyn Cibula's paintings will open with a reception Nov. 5 at the Evanston Community center, 828 Davis St..
It will continue all month.
Abstractions and semi-abstractions by Everett Mc*near are being exhibited by the University Gallery of Notre Dame until Nov. 5.
In the line of operatic trades to cushion the budget, the Dallas Civic Opera will use San Francisco's new Leni Bauer-*ecsy production of Lucia Di Lammermoor this season, returning the favor next season when San Francisco uses the Dallas Don Giovanni, designed by Franco Zeffirelli.
H E. Bates has scribbled a farce called Hark, Hark, The Lark ] it is one of the most entertaining and irresponsible novels of the season.
If there is a moral lurking among the shenanigans, it is hard to find.
Perhaps the lesson we should take from these pages is that the welfare state in England still allows wild scope for all kinds of rugged eccentrics.
Anyway, a number of them meet here in devastating collisions.
One is an imperial London stockbroker called Jerebohm.
Another is a wily countryman called Larkin, whose blandly boisterous progress has been chronicled, I believe, in earlier volumes of Mr. Bates' comedie humaine.
What's up now?
Well, Jerebohm and his wife Pinkie have reached the stage of affluence that stirs a longing for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicities.
They want to own a junior-grade castle, or a manor house, or some modest little place where Shakespeare might once have staged a pageant for Great Elizabeth and all her bearded courtiers.
They are willing to settle, however, in anything that offers pheasants to shoot at and peasants to work at.
And of course Larkin has just the thing they want.
Splendor by sorcery it's a horror.
The name of it is Gore Court, and it is surrounded by a wasteland that would impress T. S. Eliot.
That's not precisely the way Larkin urges them to look at it, though.
He conjures herds of deer, and wild birds crowding the air.
He suggests that Gore Court embodies all the glories of Tudor splendor.
The stained-glass windows may have developed unpremeditated patinas, the paneling may be no more durable than the planks in a political platform.
The vast, dungeon kitchens may seem hardly worth using except on occasions when one is faced with a thousand unexpected guests for lunch.
Larkin has an answer to all that.
The spaciousness of the Tudor cooking areas, for example, will provide needed space for the extra television sets required by modern butlers, cooks and maids.
Also, perhaps, table-tennis and other indoor sports to keep them fit and contented.
It's a wonder, really, to how much mendacious trouble Larkin puts himself to sell the Jerebohms that preposterous manse.
He doesn't really need the immense sum of money ( probably converted from American gold on the London Exchange ) he makes them pay.
For Larkin is already wonderfully contented with his lot.
He has a glorious wife and many children.
When he needs money to buy something like, say, the Rolls-*royce he keeps near his vegetable patch, he takes a flyer in the sale of surplus army supplies.
One of those capital-gains ventures, in fact, has saddled him with Gore Court.
He is willing to sell it just to get it off his hands.
And the Jerebohms are more than willing to buy it.
They plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox's life on earth.
First one, then the other if, in Larkin's eyes, they are nothing but Piccadilly farmers, he has as much to learn about them as they have to learn about the ways of truly rural living.
Mr. Bates shows us how this mutual education spreads its inevitable havoc.
Oneupmanship is practiced by both sides in a total war.
First the Larkins are ahead, then the Jerebohms.
After Larkin has been persuaded to restock his tangled acres with pheasants, he poaches only what he needs for the nourishment of his family and local callers.
One of the local callers, a retired brigadier apparently left over from Kipling's tales of India, does not approve of the way Larkin gets his birds.
He doesn't think that potting them from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance is entirely sporting.
But the brigadier dines on the birds with relish.
It is truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet made from Miguel De Cervantes' Don Quixote is the brilliant Russian spectacle, done in wide screen and color, which opened yesterday at the Fifty-fifth Street and Sixty-eighth Street Playhouses.
More than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventures and escapades of the tragi-comic knight-errant and his squire, Sancho Panza, in seventeenth-century Spain, this inevitably abbreviated rendering of the classic satire on chivalry is an affectingly warm and human exposition of character.
Nikolai Cherkasov, the Russian actor who has played such heroic roles as Alexander Nevsky and Ivan the Terrible, performs the lanky Don Quixote, and does so with a simple dignity that bridges the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man.
His addle-brained knight-errant, self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor had already been relegated to museums and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry had become a joke, is, as Cervantes no doubt intended, a gaunt but gracious symbol of good, moving soberly and sincerely in a world of cynics, hypocrites and rogues.
Cherkasov does not caricature him, as some actors have been inclined to do.
He treats this deep-eyed, bearded, bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect.
Directed by Grigory Kozintsev in a tempo that is studiously slow, he develops a sense of a high tradition shining brightly and passing gravely through an impious world.
The complexities of communication have been considerably abetted in this case by appropriately stilted English language that has been excellently dubbed in place of the Russian dialogue.
The voices of all the characters, including that of Cherkasov, have richness, roughness or color to conform with the personalities.
And the subtleties of the dialogue are most helpfully conveyed.
Since Russian was being spoken instead of Spanish, there is no violation of artistry or logic here.
Splendid, too, is the performance of Yuri Tolubeyev, one of Russia's leading comedians, as Sancho Panza, the fat, grotesque squire.
Though his character is broader and more comically rounded than the don, he gives it a firmness and toughness -- a sort of peasant dignity -- too.
It is really as though the Russians have seen in this character the oftentimes underlying vitality and courage of supposed buffoons.
The episode in which Sancho Panza concludes the joke that is played on him when he is facetiously put in command of an island is one of the best in the film.
True, the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary qualities that are a bit wearisome in the first half, before Don Quixote goes to the duke's court.
But strength and poignancy develop thenceforth, and the windmill and deathbed episodes gather the threads of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy.
There are other good representations of peasants and people of the court by actors who are finely costumed and magnificently photographed in this last of the Russian films to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange.
Also on the bill at the Fifty-fifth Street is a nice ten-minute color film called Sunday In Greenwich Village, a tour of the haunts and joints.
Television has yet to work out a living arrangement with jazz, which comes to the medium more as an uneasy guest than as a relaxed member of the family.
There seems to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of Chicago-style jazz in prime evening time, for example, could not be justified without the trimmings of a portentous documentary.
At least this seemed to be the working hypothesis for Chicago And All That Jazz, presented on *j Nov. 26.
The program came out of the *j Special Projects department, and was slotted in the Du Pont Show Of The Week series.
Perhaps Special Projects necessarily thinks along documentary lines.
If so, it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department -- one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performers and give them a little room to display their talents.
As a matter of fact, this latter approach has already been tried, and with pleasing results.
A few years ago a Timex All-*star Jazz Show offered a broad range of styles, ranging from Lionel Hampton's big band to the free-wheeling Dukes Of Dixieland.
An enthusiastic audience confirmed the live character of the hour, and provided the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seems to improve the quality of performance.
About that same time John Crosby's *j series on the popular arts proved again that giving jazz ample breathing space is one of the most sensible things a producer can do.
In an hour remembered for its almost rudderless movement, a score of jazz luminaries went before the cameras for lengthy periods.
The program had been arranged to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music.
Cameras stared at soloists' faces in extreme closeups, then considerately pulled back for full views of ensemble work.
Chicago And All That Jazz could not be faulted on the choice of artists.
Some of the in-person performers were Jack Teagarden, Gene Krupa, Bud Freeman, Pee Wee Russell, Johnny St. Cyr, Joe Sullivan, Red Allen, Lil Armstrong, Blossom Seeley.
The jazz buff could hardly ask for more.
Furthermore, Garry Moore makes an ideal master of ceremonies.
( he played host at the Timex show already mentioned.
) one of the script's big problems was how to blend pictures and music of the past with live performances by musicians of today.
N*b*c had gathered a lot of historical material which it was eager to share.
For example, there was sheet music with the word jazz in the title, to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin took hold.
Samples zoomed into closeup range in regular succession, like telephone poles passing on the highway, while representative music reinforced the mood of the late teens and 1920's.
However well chosen and cleverly arranged, such memorabilia unfortunately amounted to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the evening's main business, which ( considering the talent at hand ) should probably have been the gathering of fresh samples of the Chicago style.
Another source of *j pride was its rare film clip of Bix Beiderbecke, but this view of the great trumpeter flew by so fast that a prolonged wink would have blotted out the entire glimpse.
Similarly, in presenting still photographs of early jazz groups, the program allowed no time for a close perusal.
Chicago And All That Jazz may have wound up satisfying neither the confirmed fan nor the inquisitive newcomer.
By trying to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today's artists, the program turned out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either.
Still, the network's willingness to experiment in this musical field is to be commended, and future essays happily anticipated.
Even Joan Sutherland may not have anticipated the tremendous reception she received from the Metropolitan Opera audience attending her debut as Lucia in Donizetti's Lucia Di Lammermoor Sunday night.
The crowd staged its own mad scene in salvos of cheers and applause and finally a standing ovation as Miss Sutherland took curtain call after curtain call following a fantastic Mad Scene created on her own and with the help of the composer and the other performers.
Her entrance in Scene 2, Act 1, brought some disconcerting applause even before she had sung a note.
Thereafter the audience waxed applause-happy, but discriminating operagoers reserved judgment as her singing showed signs of strain, her musicianship some questionable procedure and her acting uncomfortable stylization.
As she gained composure during the second act, her technical resourcefulness emerged stronger, though she had already revealed a trill almost unprecedented in years of performances of Lucia.
She topped the sextet brilliantly.
Each high note had the crowd in ecstasy so that it stopped the show midway in the Mad Scene, but the real reason was a realization of the extraordinary performance unfolding at the moment.
Miss Sutherland appeared almost as another person in this scene : a much more girlish Lucia, a sensational coloratura who ran across stage while singing, and an actress immersed in her role.
What followed the outburst brought almost breathless silence as Miss Sutherland revealed her mastery of a voice probably unique among sopranos today.
This big, flexible voice with uncommon range has been superbly disciplined.
Nervousness at the start must have caused the blemishes of her first scene, or she may warm up slowly.
In the fullness of her vocal splendor, however, she could sing the famous scene magnificently.
Technically it was fascinating, aurally spell-binding, and dramatically quite realistic.
Many years have passed since a Metropolitan audience heard anything comparable.
Her debut over, perhaps the earlier scenes will emerge equally fine.
The performance also marked the debut of a most promising young conductor, Silvio Varviso.
He injected more vitality into the score than it has revealed in many years.
He may respect too much the Italian tradition of letting singers hold on to their notes, but to restrain them in a singers' opera may be quite difficult.
Richard Tucker sang Edgardo in glorious voice.
His bel canto style gave the performance a special distinction.
The remainder of the cast fulfilled its assignments no more than satisfactorily just as the old production and limited stage direction proved only serviceable.
Miss Sutherland first sang Lucia at Covent Garden in 1959.
( the first Metropolitan Opera broadcast on Dec. 9 will introduce her as Lucia.
) she has since turned to Bellini, whose opera Beatrice Di Tenda in a concert version with the American Opera Society introduced her to New York last season.
She will sing La Sonambula with it here next week.
Anyone for musical Ping-pong?
It's really quite fun -- as long as you like games.
You will need a stereo music system, with speakers preferably placed at least seven or eight feet apart, and one or more of the new London Phase 4 records.
There are 12 of these to choose from, all of them of popular music except for the star release, Pass In Review ( S*p-44001 ).
This features the marching songs of several nations, recorded as though the various national bands were marching by your reviewing stand.
Complete with crowd effects, interruptions by jet planes, and sundry other touches of realism, this disc displays London's new technique to the best effect.
All of the jackets carry a fairly technical and detailed explanation of this new recording program.
No reference is made to the possibility of recording other than popular music in this manner, and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music.
Directionality is greatly exaggerated most of the time ; but when the sounds of the two speakers are allowed to mix, there is excellent depth and dimension to the music.
You definitely hear some of the instruments close up and others farther back, with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the nearer instruments merely being louder than the ones farther back.
This is a characteristic of good stereo recording and one of its tremendous advantages over monaural sound.
London explains that the very distinct directional effect in the Phase 4 series is due in large part to their novel methods of microphoning and recording the music on a number of separate tape channels.
These are then mixed by their sound engineers with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combined into the final two channels which are impressed on the record.
In some of the numbers the instrumental parts have even been recorded at different times and then later combined on the master tape to produce special effects.
Some clue to the character of London's approach in these discs may be gained immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 titles include the word percussion or percussive.
Drums, xylophones, castanets, and other percussive instruments are reproduced remarkably well.
Only too often, however, you have the feeling that you are sitting in a room with some of the instruments lined up on one wall to your left and others facing them on the wall to your right.
They are definitely in the same room with you, but your head starts to swing as though you were sitting on the very edge of a tennis court watching a spirited volley.
The Percussive Twenties ( S*p-44006 ) stirs pleasant memories with well-known songs of that day, and Johnny Keating's Kombo gives forth with tingling jazz in Percussive Moods ( S*p-44005 ).
Big Band Percussion ( S*p-44002 ) seemed one of the least attractive discs -- the arrangements just didn't have so much character as the others.
There is an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recordings, apparently obtained at least in part by emphasizing the middle and high frequencies.
The penalty for this is noticeable in the big, bold, brilliant, but brassy piano sounds in Melody And Percussion For Two Pianos ( S*p-44007 ).
All of the releases, however, are recorded at a gratifyingly high level, with resultant masking of any surface noise.
Pass In Review practically guarantees enjoyment, and is a dramatic demonstration of the potentialities of any stereo music system.
Many Hollywood films manage somehow to be authentic, but not realistic.
Strange, but true -- authenticity and realism often aren't related at all.
Almost every film bearing the imprimatur of Hollywood is physically authentic -- in fact, impeccably so.
In any given period piece the costumes, bric-a-brac, vehicles, and decor, bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity.
The major studios maintain a cadre of film librarians and research specialists who look to this matter.
During the making recently of an important Biblical film, some 40 volumes of research material and sketches not only of costumes and interiors, but of architectural developments, sports arenas, vehicles, and other paraphernalia were compiled, consulted, and complied with.
But, alas, the authenticity seems to stop at the set's edge.
The drama itself -- and this seems to be lavishly true of Biblical drama -- often has hardly any relationship with authenticity at all.
The storyline, in sort, is wildly unrealistic.
Thus, in The Story Of Ruth we have Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz and sets that are meticulously authentic.
But except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline -- i.e., that Ruth remained with Naomi and finally wound up with Boaz -- the film version has little to do with the Bible.
And in the new King Of Kings the plot involves intrigues and twists and turns that cannot be traced to the Gospels.
Earlier this month Edward R. Murrow, director of the United States Information Agency, came to Hollywood and had dinner with more than 100 leaders of the motion picture industry.
He talked about unauthentic storylines too.
He intimated that they weren't doing the country much good in the Cold War.
And to an industry that prides itself on authenticity, he urged greater realism.
In many corners of the globe, he said, the major source of impressions about this country are in the movies they meet.
Would we want a future-day Gibbon or Macaulay recounting the saga of America with movies as his prime source of knowledge?
Yet for much of the globe, Hollywood is just that -- prime, if not sole, source of knowledge.
If a man totally ignorant of America were to judge our land and its civilization based on Hollywood alone, what conclusions do you think he might come to?
Francois D'*albert, Hungarian-born violinist who made his New York debut three years ago, played a return engagement last night in Judson Hall.
He is now president of the Chicago Conservatory College.
His pianist was Donald Jenni, a faculty member at De*paul University.
The acoustics of the small hall had been misgauged by the artists, so that for the first half of the program, when the piano was partially open, Mr. Jenni's playing was too loud.
In vying with him, Mr. D'*albert also seemed to be overdriving his tone.
This was not an overriding drawback to enjoyment of the performances, however, except in the case of the opening work, Mozart's Sonata in *j ( K. 526 ), which clattered along noisily in an unrelieved fashion.
Brahm's Sonata in *j, although also vigorous, stood up well under the two artists' strong, large-scale treatment.
Mr. D'*albert has a firm, attractive tone, which eschews an overly sweet vibrato.
He made the most of the long Brahmsian phrases, and by the directness and drive of his playing gave the work a handsome performance.
A Sonata For Violin And Piano, called Bella Bella, by Robert Fleming, was given its first United States performance.
The title refers to the nickname given his wife by the composer, who is also a member of the National Film Board of Canada.
The work's two movements, one melodically sentimental, the other brightly capricious, are clever enough in a Ravel-like style, but they rehash a wornout idiom.
They might well indicate conjugal felicity, but in musical terms that smack of Hollywood.
Works by Dohnanyi, Hubay, Mr. D'*albert himself and Paganini, indicated that the violinist had some virtuoso fireworks up his sleeve as well as a reserved attitude toward a lyric phrase.
Standard items by Sarasate and Saint-*saens completed the program.
In recent years Anna Xydis has played with the New York Philharmonic and at Lewisohn Stadium, but her program last night at Town Hall was the Greek-born pianist's first New York recital since 1948.
Miss Xydis has a natural affinity for the keyboard, and in the twenty years since her debut here she has gained the authority and inner assurance that lead to audience control.
And the tone she commands is always beautiful in sound.
Since she also has considerable technical virtuosity and a feeling for music in the romantic tradition, Miss Xydis gave her listeners a good deal of pleasure.
She played with style and a touch of the grand manner, and every piece she performed was especially effective in its closing measures.
The second half of her program was devoted to Russian composers of this century.
It was in them that Miss Xydis was at her best.
The Rachmaninoff Prelude No. 12, Op. 32, for instance, gave her an opportunity to exploit one of her special facilities -- the ability to produce fine deep-sounding bass tones while contrasting them simultaneously with fine silver filagree in the treble.
The four Kabalevsky Preludes were also assured, rich in color and songful.
And the Prokofieff Seventh Sonata had the combination of romanticism and modern bravura that Prokofieff needs.
Miss Xydis' earlier selections were Mendelssohn's Variations Serieuses, in which each variation was nicely set off from the others ; Haydn's Sonata in *j minor, which was unfailingly pleasant in sound, and Chopin's Sonata in *j flat minor.
A memory lapse in the last somewhat marred the pianist's performance.
So, what was the deepest music on her program had the poorest showing.
Miss Xydis was best when she did not need to be too probing.
All the generals who held important commands in World War 2 did not write books.
It only seems as if they did.
And the best books by generals were not necessarily the first ones written.
One of the very best is only now published in this country, five years after its first publication in England.
It is Defeat Into Victory, by Field Marshal Viscount Slim.
A long book heavily weighted with military technicalities, in this edition it is neither so long nor so technical as it was originally.
Field Marshal Slim has abridged it for the benefit of those who, finding not so great an attraction in accounts of military moves and counter-moves, are more interested in men and their reactions to stress, hardship and danger.
The man whose reactions and conclusions get the most space is, of course, the Field Marshal himself.
William Joseph Slim, First Viscount Slim, former Governor General of Australia, was the principal British commander in the field during the Burma War.
He had been a corps commander during the disastrous defeat and retreat of 1942 when the ill-prepared, ill-equipped British forces were outmaneuvered, outfought and outgeneraled.
He returned in command of an international army of Gurkhas, Indians, Africans, Chinese and British.
And in a series of bitterly fought battles in the jungles and hills and along the great rivers of Burma he waged one of the most brilliant campaigns of the war.
The Forgotten War his soldiers called the Burma fighting because the war in Africa and Europe enjoyed priorities in equipment and in headlines.
Parts of Defeat Into Victory are a tangle of Burmese place names and military units, but a little application makes everything clear enough.
On the whole this is an interesting and exceptionally well-written book.
Field Marshal Slim is striking in description, amusing in many anecdotes.
He has a pleasant sense of humor and is modest enough to admit mistakes and even a cardinal error.
He praises many individuals generously.
He himself seems to be tough, tireless, able and intelligent, more intellectual and self-critical than most soldiers.
Remaking an army to win Defeat Into Victory is a dramatic and lively military narrative.
But it is most interesting in its account of the unending problems of high command, of decisions and their reasons, of the myriad matters that demand attention in addition to battle action.
Before he could return to Burma, Field Marshal Slim had to rally the defeated remnants of a discouraged army and unite them with fresh recruits.
His remarks about training, discipline, morale, leadership and command are enlightening.
He believed in making inspiring speeches and he made a great many.
He believed in being seen near the front lines and he was there.
For general morale reasons and to encourage the efforts of his supply officers, when food was short for combat troops he cut the rations of his headquarters staff accordingly.
Other crucial matters required constant supervision : labor and all noncombatant troops, whose morale was vital, too ; administrative organization and delicate diplomatic relations with Top Brass -- British, American and Chinese ; health, hygiene, medical aid and preventive medicine ; hospitals ( inadequate ) and nurses ( scanty ) ; food and military supplies ; logistics and transport ; airdrops and airstrips ; roads and river barges to be built.
Expected of a commander commenting on these and other matters, Field Marshal Slim makes many frank and provocative remarks : when in doubt as to two courses of action, a general should choose the bolder.
The commander has failed in his duty if he has not won victory -- for that is his duty.
It only does harm to talk to troops about new and desirable equipment which others may have but which you cannot give them.
It depresses them.
So I made no mention of air transport until we could get at least some of it.
Field Marshal Slim is more impressed by the courage of Japanese soldiers than he is by the ability of their commanders.
Of the Japanese private he says : he fought and marched till he died.
If 500 Japanese were ordered to hold a position, we had to kill 495 before it was ours -- and then the last five killed themselves.
Brooding about future wars, the Field Marshal has this to say : the Asian fighting man is at least equally brave ( as the white ), usually more careless of death, less encumbered by mental doubts, less troubled by humanitarian sentiment, and not so moved by slaughter and mutilation around him.
He is, by background and living standards, better fitted to endure hardship uncomplainingly, to demand less in the way of subsistence or comfort, and to look after himself when thrown on his own resources.
A bunch of young buckaroos from out West, who go by the name of Texas Boys Choir, loped into Town Hall last night and succeeded in corralling the hearts of a sizable audience.
Actually, the program they sang was at least two-thirds serious and high-minded, and they sang it beautifully.
Under the capable direction of the choir's founder, Geroge Bragg, the twenty-six boys made some lovely sounds in an opening group of Renaissance and Baroque madrigals and motets, excerpts from Pergolesi's Stabat Mater and all of the Britten Ceremonial Of Carols.
Their singing was well-balanced, clear and, within obvious limitations, extremely pleasing.
The limitations are those one expects from untrained and unsettled voices -- an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity, an occasional waver and now and then a bleat.
But Mr. Bragg is a remarkably gifted conductor, and the results he has produced with his boys are generally superior.
Most surprising of all, he has accomplished some prodigies in training for the production of words.
The Latin, for example, was not only clear ; it was even beautiful.
Furthermore, there were solid musical virtues in the interpretation of the music.
Lines came out neatly and in good balance.
Tempos were lively.
The piano accompaniments by Istvan Szelenyi were stylish.
A boy soprano named Dixon Boyd sang a Durante solo motet and a few other passages enchantingly.
Other capable soloists included David Clifton, Joseph Schockler and Pat Thompson.
The final group included folk songs from back home, stomped out, shouted and chanted with irresistible spirit and in cowboy costume.
Boys will be boys, and Texans will be Texans.
The combination proved quite irresistible last night.
The Polish song and dance company called Mazowsze, after the region of Poland, where it has its headquarters, opened a three-week engagement at the City Center last night.
A thoroughly ingratiating company it is, and when the final curtain falls you may suddenly realize that you have been sitting with a broad grin on your face all evening.
Not that it is all funny, by any means, though some of it is definitely so, but simply that the dancers are young and handsome, high-spirited and communicative, and the program itself is as vivacious as it is varied.
There is no use at all in trying to follow it dance by dance and title by title, for it has a kind of nonstop format, and moves along in an admirable continuity that demands no pauses for identification.
The material is all basically of folk origin, gleaned from every section of Poland.
But under the direction of Mira Ziminska-*sygietynska, who with her late husband founded the organization in 1948, it has all been put into theatrical form, treated selectively, choreographed specifically for presentation to spectators, and performed altogether professionally.
Under the surface of the wide range of folk movements is apparent a sound technical ballet training, and an equally professional sense of performing.
Since the organization was created thirteen years ago, it is obvious that this is not the original company ; it is more likely the sons and daughters of that company.
The girls are charming children and the men are wonderfully vital and engaging youngsters.
The stage is constantly full of them ; indeed, there are never fewer than eight of them on stage, and that is only for the more intimate numbers.
They can be exuberant or sentimental, flirtatious or funny, but the only thing they seem unable to be is dull.
To pick out particular numbers is something of a problem, but one or two identifiable items are too conspicuously excellent to be missed.
There is, for example, a stunning Krakowiak that closes the first act ; the mazurka choreographed by Witold Zapala to music from Moniuszko's opera, Strasny Dwor', may be the most beautiful mazurka you are likely ever to see ; there is an enchanting polonaise ; and the dances and songs from the Tatras contain a magnificent dance for the men.
Everywhere there are little touches of humor, and the leader of the on-stage band of musicians is an ebullient comedian who plays all sorts of odd instruments with winning warmth.
The Theatre-by-the-*sea, Matunuck, presents King Of Hearts by Jean Kerr and Eleanor Brooke.
Directed by Michael Murray ; settings by William David Roberts.
The cast : producer John Holmes has chosen a delightful comedy for his season's opener at Matunuck in Jean Kerr's King Of Hearts.
The dialogue is sharp, witty and candid -- typical don't eat the daisies material -- which has stamped the author throughout her books and plays, and it was obvious that the Theatre-by-the-*sea audience liked it.
The story is of a famous strip cartoonist, an arty individual, whose specialty is the American boy and who adopts a 10-year-old to provide him with fresh idea material.
This is when his troubles begin, not to mention a fledgling artist who he hires, and who turns out to have ideas of his own, with particular respect to the hero's sweetheart-secretary.
John Heffernan, playing Larry Larkin, the cartoonist, carries the show in marvelous fashion.
His portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist is virtually flawless.
This may be unfortunate, perhaps, from the standpoint of David Hedison, Providence's contribution to Hollywood, who is appearing by special arrangement with 20th Century-*fox.
Not that Mr. Hedison does not make the most of his role.
He does, and more.
But the book is written around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist, and it has to be that way.
A word should be said for Gary Morgan, a Broadway youngster who, as the adopted son, makes life miserable for nearly everybody and Larkin in particular.
And for his playmate, Francis Coletta of West Warwick, who has a bit part, Billy.
On the whole, audiences will like this performance.
It is a tremendous book, lively, constantly moving, and the Matunuck cast does well by it.
The Newport Playhouse presents Epitaph For George Dillon by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton, directed by Wallace Gray.
The cast : the angriest young man in Newport last night was at the Playhouse, where Epitaph For George Dillon opened as the jazz festival closed.
For the hero of this work by John Osborne and Anthony Creighton is a chap embittered by more than the lack of beer during a jam session.
He's mad at a world he did not make.
Furthermore, he's something of a scoundrel, an artist whose mind and feelings are all finger-tips.
This is in contrast to the family with whom he boards.
They not only think and feel cliches but live cliches as well.
It is into this household, one eroded by irritations that have tortured the souls out of its people, that George Dillon enters at the beginning of the play.
An unsuccessful playwright and actor, he has faith only in himself and in a talent he is not sure exists.
By the end of the third act, the artist is dead but the body lingers on, a shell among other shells.
Not altogether a successful play, Epitaph For George Dillon overcomes through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be crippling.
It is awfully talky, for instance, and not all of the talk is terribly impressive.
But it strikes sparks on occasion and their light causes all else to be forgotten.
There is a fine second act, as an example, one in which Samuel Groom, as Dillon, has an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another.
This is an exciting young actor to watch.
Just as exciting but in a more technically proficient way is Laura Stuart, whose complete control of her every movement is lovely to watch.
Miss Stuart is as intensely vibrant as one could wish, almost an icy shriek threatening to explode at any moment.
Also fine are Sue Lawless, as a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just as destructive, Harold Cherry, as her scratchy spouse, and Hildy Weissman, as a vegetable in human form.
Wallace Gray has directed a difficult play here, usually well, but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for my taste.
Still, his finale is put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance, despair.
The Warwick Musical Theater presents Where's Charley?
With music and lyrics by Frank Loesser, directed by Christopher Hewett, choreography by Peter Conlow, musical direction by Samuel Matlowsky.
The cast : everybody fell in love with Amy again last night at the Warwick Musical Theater, and Shelley Berman was to blame.
One of the finest soft shoe tunes ever invented, Once In Love With Amy is also, of course, one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyrics to come out of American musical comedy in our era.
So the audience last night was all ears and eyes just after Act 2 got a rousing opening chorus, Where's Charley?
, and Berman sifted out all alone on the stage with the ambling chords and beat of the song just whispering into being.
It is greatly to Berman's credit that he made no attempt to outdo Ray Bolger.
He dropped his earlier and delightful hamming, which is about the only way to handle the old war horse called Charley's Aunt, and let himself go with as appealing an Amy as anybody could ask.
In brief, Berman played himself and not Bolger.
The big audience started applauding even before he had finished.
The whole production this week is fresh and lively.
The costumes are stunning evocations of the voluminous gowns and picture hats of the Gibson Girl days.
The ballet work is on the nose, especially in the opening number by The New Ashmolean Marching Society and Students' Conservatory Band, along with a fiery and sultry Brazilian fantasia later.
Berman, whose fame has rested in recent years on his skills as a night club monologist, proved himself very much at home in musical comedy.
Sparrow-size Virginia Gibson, with sparkling blue eyes and a cheerful smile, made a suitably perky Amy, while Melisande Congdon, as the real aunt, was positively monumental in the very best Gibson Girl manner.
All told, Where's Charley?
Ought not to be missed.
It has a fast pace, excellent music, expert direction, and not only a good comedian, but an appealing person in his own right, Mr. Berman.
The Broadway Theater League of Rhode Island presents C. Edwin Knill's and Martin Tahse's production of Fiorello ] at Veterans Memorial Auditorium.
The book is by Jerome Weidman and George Abbott, music by Jerry Bock, lyrics by Sheldon Harnick, choreography by Peter Gennaro, scenery, costumes and lighting by William and Jean Eckart, musical direction by Jack Elliott, and the production was directed by Mr. Abbott.
The cast : this is one of the happier events of the season.
The company which performed the Pulitzer Prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today is full of bounce, the politicians are in fine voice, the chorines evoke happy memories, and the Little Flower rides to break a lance again.
I saw Fiorello ] performed in New York by the original cast and I think this company is every bit as good, and perhaps better.
Certainly in the matter of principals there is nothing lacking.
Bob Carroll may not bear quite as close a physical resemblance to La*guardia as Tom Bosley does, but I was amazed at the way he became more and more Fiorello as the evening progressed, until one had to catch one's self up and remember that this wasn't really La*guardia come back among us again.
Then Rudy Bond was simply grand as Ben, the distraught Republican Party district chieftain.
And Paul Lipson, as Morris, the faithful one who never gets home to his Shirley's dinner, was fine, too.
As for the ladies, they were full of charm, and sincerity, and deep and abiding affection for this hurrying driving, honest, little man.
Charlotte Fairchild was excellent as the loyal Marie, who became the second Mrs. La*guardia, singing and acting with remarkable conviction.
Jen Nelson, as Thea, his first wife, managed to make that short role impressive.
And little Zeme North, a Dora with real spirit and verve, was fascinating whether she was singing of her love for Floyd, the cop who becomes sewer commissioner and then is promoted into garbage, or just dancing to display her exuberant feelings.
Such fascinating novelties in the score as the fugual treatment of On The Side Of The Angels and Politics And Poker were handled splendidly, and I thought Rudy Bond and his band of tuneful ward-heelers made Little Tin Box even better than it was done by the New York cast ; all the words of its clever lyrics came through with perfect clarity.
The party at Floyd's penthouse gave the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routines which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era's nonsense.
La*guardia's multi-lingual rallies, when he is running for Congress, are well staged, and wind up in a wild Jewish folk-dance that is really great musical theater.
Martin Tahse has established quite a reputation for himself as a successful stager of touring productions.
Not a corner has been visibly cut in this one.
The sets are remarkably elaborate for a road-show that doesn't pause long in any one place, and they are devised so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness.
( several times recently I have wondered whether shows were being staged for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery being shifted right in front of their eyes.
I'm glad to say there's none of that distraction in this Fiorello ] ) it has all been done in superb style, and the result is a show which deserves the support of every person hereabouts who enjoys good musical theater.
Loew's theater presents Where The Boys Are, an *j picture produced by Joe Pasternak and directed by Henry Levin from a screenplay by George Wells.
The cast : since the hero, a sterling and upright fellow, is a rich Brown senior, while two Yalies are cast as virtual rapists, I suppose I should disqualify myself from sitting in judgment on Where The Boys Are, but I shall do nothing of the sort.
Instead -- and not just to prove my objectivity -- I hasten to report that it's a highly amusing film which probably does a fairly accurate job of reporting on the Easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in Fort Lauderdale, and that it seems to come to grips quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vexes youngsters in this age group -- that is to say, sex.
The answers the girls give struck me as reasonably varied and healthily individual.
If most of them weren't exactly specific -- well, that's the way it is in life, I guess.
But at least it's reassuring to see some teenagers who don't profess to know all the answers and are thinking about their problems instead.
Where The Boys Are also has a juvenile bounce that makes for a refreshing venture in comedy.
There are some sharp and whipping lines and some hilariously funny situations -- the best of the latter being a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a mermaid is performing.
Most of the female faces are new, or at least not too familiar.
Dolores Hart, is charming in a leading role, and quite believable.
I was delighted with Paula Prentiss' comedy performance, which was as fresh and unstilted as one's highest hopes might ask.
A couple of the males made good comedy, too -- Jim Hutton and Frank Gorshin.
The only performance which was too soft for me was that of Yvette Mimieux, but since someone had to become the victim of despoilers, just to emphasize that such things do happen at these fracases, I suppose this was the attitude the part called for.
I must say, however, that I preferred the acting that had something of a biting edge to it.
To anyone who remembers Newport at its less than maximum violence, this view of what the boys and girls do in the springtime before they wing north for the Jazz Festival ought to prove entertaining.
The second feature, The Price Of Silence, is a British detective story that will talk your head off.
The superb intellectual and spiritual vitality of William James was never more evident than in his letters.
Here was a man with an enormous gift for living as well as thinking.
To both persons and ideas he brought the same delighted interest, the same open-minded relish for what was unique in each, the same discriminating sensibility and quicksilver intelligence, the same gallantry of judgment.
For this latest addition to the Great Letters Series, under the general editorship of Louis Kronenberger, Miss Hardwick has made a selection which admirably displays the variety of James's genius, not to mention the felicities of his style.
And how he could write ] his famous criticism of brother Henry's third style is surely as subtly, even elegantly, worded an analysis of the latter's intricate air castles as Henry himself could ever have produced.
His letter to his daughter on the pains of growing up is surely as trenchant, forthright, and warmly understanding a piece of advice as ever a grown-up penned to a sensitive child, and with just the right tone of unpatronizing good humor.
Most of all, his letters to his philosophic colleagues show a magnanimity as well as an honesty which help to explain Whitehead's reference to James as that adorable genius.
Miss Hardwick speaks of his superb gift for intellectual friendship, and it is certainly a joy to see the intellectual life lived so free from either academic aridity or passionate dogmatism.
This is a virtue of which we have great need in a society where there seems to be an increasing lack of communication -- or even desire for communication -- between differing schools of thought.
It holds an equally valuable lesson for a society where the word intellectual has become a term of opprobrium to millions of well-meaning people who somehow imagine that it must be destructive of the simpler human virtues.
To his Harvard colleague, Josiah Royce, whose philosophic position differed radically from his own, James could write, different as our minds are, yours has nourished mine, as no other social influence ever has, and in converse with you I have always felt that my life was being lived importantly.
Of another colleague, George Santayana, he could write : the great event in my life recently has been the reading of Santayana's book.
Although I absolutely reject the Platonism of it, I have literally squealed with delight at the imperturbable perfection with which the position is laid down on page after page.
Writing to his colleague George Herbert Palmer -- glorious old Palmer, as he addresses him -- James says that if only the students at Harvard could really understand Royce, Santayana, Palmer, and himself and see that their varying systems are so many religions, ways of fronting life, and worth fighting for, then Harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe.
The best condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse systems.
The world might ring with the struggle, if we devoted ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other.
The belaboring is of course jocular, yet James was not lacking in fundamental seriousness -- unless we measure him by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stakes all on his vision of God.
To James this vision never quite came, despite his appreciation of it in others.
But there is a dignity and even a hint of the inspired prophet in his words to one correspondent : you ask what I am going to reply to Bradley.
But why need one reply to everything and everybody?
I think that readers generally hate minute polemics and recriminations.
All polemic of ours should, I believe, be either very broad statements of contrast, or fine points treated singly, and as far as possible impersonally.
As far as the rising generation goes, why not simply express ourselves positively, and trust that the truer view quietly will displace the other.
Here again God will know his own.
The collected works of James Thurber, now numbering 25 volumes ( including the present exhibit ) represent a high standard of literary excellence, as every schoolboy knows.
The primitive-eclogue quality of his drawings, akin to that of graffiti scratched on a cave wall, is equally well known.
About all that remains to be said is that the present selection, most of which appeared first in The New Yorker, comprises ( as usual ) a slightly unstrung necklace, held together by little more than a slender thread cunningly inserted in the spine of the book.
The one unifying note, if any, is sounded in the initial article entitled : How To Get Through The Day.
It is repeated at intervals in some rather sadly desperate word-games for insomniacs, the hospitalized, and others forced to rely on inner resources, including ( in the *j alone ) palindromes, paraphrases, and parodies.
The Tyranny Of Trivia suggests arbitrary alphabetical associations to induce slumber.
And new vistas of hairshirt asceticism are opened by scholarly monographs entitled : Friends, Romans, Countrymen, Lend Me Your Ear-*muffs, such a phrase as Drifts Through Dream, and The New Vocabularianism.
Some of Thurber's curative methods involve strong potions of mixed metaphor, malapropism, and gobbledygook and are recommended for use only in extreme cases.
A burlesque paean entitled : Hark The Herald Tribune, Times, And All The Other Angels Sing brilliantly succeeds in exaggerating even motion-picture ballyhooey.
How The Kooks Crumble features an amusingly accurate take-off on sneaky announcers who attempt to homogenize radio-*t*v commercials, and The Watchers Of The Night is a veritable waking nightmare.
A semi-serious literary document entitled The Wings Of Henry James is noteworthy, if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master's difficult later period by modest Owen Wister, author of The Virginian.
James, he remarks in a letter to a friend, is attempting the impossible namely, to produce upon the reader, as a painting produces upon the gazer, a number of superimposed, simultaneous impressions.
He would like to put several sentences on top of each other so that you could read them all at once, and get all at once, the various shadings and complexities.
Equally penetrating in its fashion is the following remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation : so much has already been written about everything that you can't find out anything about it.
Or the mildly epigrammatic utterance ( also a quotation ) : woman's place is in the wrong.
Who but Thurber can be counted on to glean such nectareous essences?
A tribute to midsummer bang-sashes seems terribly funny, though it would be hard to explain why.
One of them banged the sash of the window nearest my bed around midnight in July and I leaped out of sleep and out of bed.
It's just a bat, said my wife reassuringly, and I sighed with relief.
Thank God for that, I said ; I thought it was a human being.
In a sense, perhaps, Thurber is indebted artistically to the surrealist painter ( was it Salvador Dali?
) who first conceived the startling fancy of a picture window in the abdomen.
That is, it is literally a picture window : you don't see into the viscera ; you see a picture -- trees, or flowers.
This is something like what Thurber's best effects are like, if I am not mistaken.
Though no longer able to turn out his protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketches ( several old favorites are scattered through the present volume ) Thurber has retained unimpaired his vision of humor as a thing of simple, unaffected humanness.
In his concluding paragraph he writes : the devoted writer of humor will continue to try to come as close to truth as he can.
For many readers Thurber comes closer than anyone else in sight.
The latest Low is a puzzler.
The master's hand has lost none of its craft.
He is at his usual best in exposing the shams and self-deceptions of political and diplomatic life in the fifties.
The reader meets a few old friends like Blimp and the *j horse, and becomes better acquainted with new members of the cast of characters like the bomb itself, and civilization in her classic robe watching the nuclear arms race, her hair standing straight out.
But there is a difference between the present volume and the early Low.
There is fear in the fifties as his title suggests and as his competent drawings show.
But there was terror in the thirties when the Nazis were on the loose and in those days Low struck like lightning.
Anyone can draw his own conclusions from this difference.
It might be argued that the Communists are less inhuman than the Nazis and furnish the artist with drama in a lower key.
But this argument cannot be pushed very far because the Communist system makes up for any shortcomings of its leaders in respect to corrosion.
The Communists wield a power unknown to Hitler.
And the leading issue, that of piecemeal aggression, remains the same.
This is drama enough.
Do we ourselves offer Mr. Low less of a crusade?
In the thirties we would not face our enemy ; that was a nightmarish situation and Low was in his element.
Now we have stood up to the Communists ; we are stronger and more self-confident -- and Low cannot so easily put us to rights.
Or does the reason for less Jovian drawings lie elsewhere?
It might be that Low has seen too many stupidities and that they do not outrage him now.
He writes, Confucius held that in times of stress one should take short views -- only up to lunchtime.
Whatever the cause, his mood in the fifties rarely rises above the level of the capably sardonic.
Dulles?
He does not seem to have caught the subtleties of the man.
Mc*carthy?
The skies turn dark but the clouds do not loose their wrath.
Suez?
Low seems to have supported Eden at first and then relented because things worked out differently, so there is no fire in his eye.
Stalin's death, Churchill's farewell to public life, Hillary and Tensing on Everest, Quemoy and Matsu -- all subjects for a noble anger or an accolade.
Instead the cartoons seem to deal with foibles.
Their Eisenhower is insubstantial.
Did Low decide to let well enough alone when he made his selections?
He often drew the bomb.
He showed puny men attacked by splendidly tyrannical machines.
And Khrushchev turned out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of them all.
But, but and but.
Look in this book for weak mortals and only on occasion for virtues and vices on the heroic scale.
Read the moderately brief text, not for captions, sometimes for tart epigrams, once in a while for an explosion in the middle of your fixed ideas.
A gray fox with a patch on one eye -- confidence man, city slicker, lebensraum specialist -- tries to take over Catfish Bend in this third relaxed allegory from Mr. Burman's refreshing Louisiana animal community.
The fox is all ingratiating smiles when he arrives from New Orleans, accompanied by one wharf rat.
But like all despots, as he builds his following from among the gullible, he grows more threatening toward those who won't follow -- such solid citizens as Doc Raccoon ; Judge Black, the vegetarian black snake ; and the eagle, who leads the bird community when he is not too busy in Washington posing for fifty-cent pieces.
As soon as the fox has taken hold on most of the populace he imports more wharf rats, who, of course, say they are the aggrieved victims of an extermination campaign in the city.
( the followers of bullies invariably are aggrieved about the very things they plan to do to others.
) they train the mink and other animals to fight.
And pretty soon gray fox is announcing that he won't have anyone around that's against him, and setting out to break his second territorial treaty with the birds.
Robert Hillyer, the poet, writes in his introduction to this brief animal fable that Mr. Burman ought to win a Nobel Prize for the Catfish Bend series.
He may have a point in urging that decadent themes be given fewer prizes.
But it's hard to imagine Mr. Burman as a Nobel laureate on the basis of these charming but not really momentous fables.
In substance they lie somewhere between the Southern dialect animal stories of Joel Chandler Harris ( Uncle Remus ) and the polished, witty fables of James Thurber.
George Kennan's account of relations between Russia and the West from the fall of Tsarism to the end of World War 2 is the finest piece of diplomatic history that has appeared in many years.
It combines qualities that are seldom found in one work : scrupulous scholarship, a fund of personal experience, a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era's great historical issues.
In short, the book, based largely on lectures delivered at Harvard University, is both reliable and readable ; the author possesses an uncommonly fine English style, and he is dealing with subjects of vast importance that are highly topical for our time.
If Mr. Kennan is sometimes a little somber in his appraisals, if his analysis of how Western diplomacy met the challenge of an era of great wars and social revolutions is often critical and pessimistic -- well, the record itself is not too encouraging.
Mr. Kennan takes careful account of every mitigating circumstance in recalling the historical atmosphere in which mistaken decisions were taken.
But he rejects, perhaps a little too sweepingly, the theory that disloyal and pro-*communist influences may have contributed to the policy of appeasing Stalin which persisted until after the end of the war and reached its high point at the Yalta Conference in February, 1945.
After all, Alger Hiss, subsequently convicted of perjury in denying that he gave secret State Department documents to Soviet agents, was at Yalta.
And Harry Dexter White, implicated in F.*b.*i. reports in Communist associations, was one of the architects of the Morgenthau Plan, which had it ever been put into full operation, would have simply handed Germany to Stalin.
One item in this unhappy scheme was to have Germany policed exclusively by its continental neighbors, among whom only the Soviet Union possessed real military strength.
It is quite probable, however, that stupidity, inexperience and childish adherence to slogans like unconditional surrender had more to do with the unsatisfactory settlements at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with Communism.
Mr. Kennan sums up his judgment of what went wrong this way : dashed hope you see, first of all and in a sense as the source of all other ills, the unshakeable American commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender : the tendency to view any war in which we might be involved not as a means of achieving limited objectives in the way of changes in a given status quo, but as a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil, with the result that the war had absolutely to be fought to the complete destruction of the enemy's power, no matter what disadvantages or complications this might involve for the more distant future.
Recognizing that there could have been no effective negotiated peace with Hitler, he points out the shocking failure to give support to the anti-*nazi underground, which very nearly eliminated Hitler in 1944.
A veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of Russian language, history and literature, Kennan recalls how, at the time of Hitler's attack on the Soviet Union in 1941, he penned a private note to a State Department official, expressing the hope that never would we associate ourselves with Russian purposes in the areas of eastern Europe beyond her own boundaries.
The hope was vain.
With justified bitterness the author speaks of what seems to me to have been an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the Russian Communist movement, about the history of its diplomacy, about what had happened in the purges, and about what had been going on in Poland and the Baltic States.
He also speaks of Franklin D. Roosevelt's puerile assumption that if only he ( Stalin ) could be exposed to the persuasive charm of someone like F.*d.*r. himself, ideological preconceptions would melt and Russia's co-operation with the West could be easily arranged.
No wonder Khrushchev's first message to President Kennedy was a wistful desire for the return of the good old days of Roosevelt.
This fascinating story begins with a sketch, rich in personal detail, of the glancing mutual impact of World War 1 and the two instalments of the Russian Revolution.
The first of these involved the replacement of the Tsar by a liberal Provisional Government in March, 1917 ; the second, the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks ( who later called themselves Communists ) in November of the same year.
As Kennan shows, the judgment of the Allied governments about what was happening in Russia was warped by the obsession of defeating Germany.
They were blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the Russian people fighting.
They attributed everything that went wrong in Russia to German influence and intrigue.
This, more than any other factor, led to the fiasco of Allied intervention.
As the author very justly says : had a world war not been in progress, there would never, under any conceivable stretch of the imagination, have been an Allied intervention in North Russia.
The scope and significance of this intervention have been grossly exaggerated by Communist propaganda ; here Kennan, operating with precise facts and figures, performs an excellent job of debunking.
Plebian dictators of many passages in the book that exemplify the author's vivid style, the characterizations of the two plebeian dictators whose crimes make those of crowned autocrats pale by comparison may be selected.
On Stalin : this was a man of incredible criminality, of a criminality effectively without limits ; a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love, without mercy or pity ; a man in whose entourage none was ever safe ; a man whose hand was set against all that could not be useful to him at the moment ; a man who was most dangerous of all to those who were his closest collaborators in crime.
And here is Kennan's image of Hitler, Stalin's temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weaker peoples, and his later enemy : behind that Charlie Chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always covered his forehead, behind the tirades and the sulky silences, the passionate orations and the occasional dull evasive stare, behind the prejudices, the cynicism, the total amorality of behavior, behind even the tendency to great strategic mistakes, there lay a statesman of no mean qualities : shrewd, calculating, in many ways realistic, endowed -- like Stalin -- with considerable powers of dissimulation, capable of playing his cards very close to his chest when he so desired, yet bold and resolute in his decisions, and possessing one gift Stalin did not possess : the ability to rouse men to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the spoken word.
Two criticisms of this generally admirable and fascinating book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which is jagged at the edges -- there is no mention of the Potsdam Conference or the Morgenthau Plan.
And in a concluding chapter about America's stance in the contemporary world, one senses certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grips with the baffling riddle of our time : how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war.
But one should not ask for everything.
Mr. Kennan, who has recently abandoned authorship for a new round of diplomacy as the recently appointed American ambassador to Yugoslavia, is not the only man who finds it easier to portray the past than to prescribe for the future.
The story of a quarter of a century of Soviet-*western relations is vitally important, and it is told with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator.
The Ireland we usually hear about in the theater is a place of bitter political or domestic unrest, lightened occasionally with flashes of native wit and charm.
In Donnybrook, there is quite a different Eire, a rural land where singing, dancing, fist-fighting and romancing are the thing.
There is plenty of violence, to be sure, but it is a nice violence and no one gets killed.
By and large, Robert Mc*enroe's adaptation of Maurice Walsh's film, The Quiet Man, provides the entertainment it set out to, and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one.
This is the tale of one John Enright, an American who has accidentally killed a man in the prize ring and is now trying to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man.
But Innesfree, where Ellen Roe Danaher and her bullying brother, Will, live, is no place for a man who will not use his fists.
So Enright's courting of the mettlesome Ellen is impeded considerably, thereby providing the tale which is told.
You may be sure he marries her in the end and has a fine old knockdown fight with the brother, and that there are plenty of minor scraps along the way to ensure that you understand what the word Donnybrook means.
Then there is a matchmaker, one Mikeen Flynn, a role for which Eddie Foy was happily selected.
Now there is no reason in the world why a matchmaker in Ireland should happen also to be a talented soft-shoe dancer and gifted improviser of movements of the limbs, torso and neck, except that these talents add immensely to the enjoyment of the play.
Mr. Foy is a joy, having learned his dancing by practicing it until he is practically perfect.
His matchmaking is, naturally, incidental, and it only serves Flynn right when a determined widow takes him by the ear and leads him off to matrimony.
Art Lund, a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice, impersonates Enright.
Although he is not graced with the subtleties of romantic technique, that's not what an ex-prize fighter is supposed to have, anyway.
Joan Fagan, a fiery redhead who can impress you that she has a temper whether she really has one or not, plays Ellen, and sings the role very well, too.
If the mettle which Ellen exhibits has a bit of theatrical dross in it, never mind ; she fits into the general scheme well enough.
Susan Johnson, as the widow, spends the first half of the play running a bar and singing about the unlamented death of her late husband and the second half trying to acquire a new one.
She has a good, firm delivery of songs and adds to the solid virtues of the evening.
Then there are a pair of old biddies played by Grace Carney and Sibly Bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock Irish characters, but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into their parts that they're quite entertaining.
And in the role of Will Danaher, Philip Bosco roars and sneers sufficiently to intimidate not only one American but the whole British army, if he chose.
Donnybrook is no Brigadoon, but it does have some very nice romantic background touches and some excellent dancing.
The ballads are sweet and sad, and the music generally competent.
It sometimes threatens to linger in the memory after the final curtain, and some of it, such as the catchy Sez I, does.
A Toast To The Bride, sung by Clarence Nordstrom, playing a character called Old Man Toomey, is quite simple, direct and touching.
The men of Innesfree are got up authentically in cloth caps and sweaters, and their dancing and singing is fine.
So is that of the limber company of lasses who whirl and glide and quickstep under Jack Cole's expert choreographic direction.
The male dancers sometimes wear kilts and their performance in them is spirited and stimulating.
Rouben Ter-*arutunian, in his stage settings, often uses the scrim curtain behind which Mr. Cole has placed couples or groups who sing and set the mood for the scenes which are to follow.
There is no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at Donnybrook, unless they are permanently in the mood of Enright when he sings about how easily he could hate the lovable Irish.
We can all breathe more easily this morning -- more easily and joyously, too -- because Joshua Logan has turned the stage show, Fanny, into a delightful and heart-warming film.
The task of taking the raw material of Marcel Pagnol's original trio of French films about people of the waterfront in Marseilles and putting them again on the screen, after their passage through the Broadway musical idiom, was a delicate and perilous one, indeed.
More than the fans of Pagnol's old films and of their heroic star, the great Raimu, were looking askance at the project.
The fans of the musical were, too.
But now the task is completed and the uncertainty resolved with the opening of the English-dialogue picture at the Music Hall yesterday.
Whether fan of the Pagnol films or stage show, whether partial to music or not, you can't help but derive joy from this picture if you have a sense of humor and a heart.
Some of the New York Philharmonic musicians who live in the suburbs spent yesterday morning digging themselves free from snow.
A tiny handful never did make the concert.
But, after a fifteen-minute delay, the substantially complete Philharmonic assembled on stage for the afternoon's proceedings.
They faced a rather small audience, as quite a few subscribers apparently had decided to forego the pleasures of the afternoon.
It was an excellent concert.
Paul Paray, rounding out his current stint with the orchestra, is a solid musician, and the Philharmonic plays for him.
Their collaboration in the Beethoven Second Symphony was lucid, intelligent and natural sounding.
It was not a heavy, ponderous Beethoven.
The music sang nicely, sprinted evenly when necessary, was properly accented and balanced.
The Franck symphonic poem, Psyche, is a lush, sweet-sounding affair that was pleasant to encounter once again.
Fortunate for the music itself, it is not too frequent a visitor ; if it were, its heavily chromatic harmonies would soon become cloying.
Mr. Paray resisted the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic elements of the score.
He did not let the strings, for instance, weep, whine or get hysterical.
His interpretation was a model of refinement and accuracy.
And in the Prokofieff *j major Piano Concerto, with Zadel Skolovsky as soloist, he was an admirable partner.
Mr. Skolovsky's approach to the concerto was bold, sweeping and tonally percussive.
He swept through the music with ease, in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner.
An impressive technician, Mr. Skolovsky has fine rhythm, to boot.
His tone is the weakest part of his equipment ; it tends to be hard and colorless.
A school of thought has it that those attributes are exactly what this concerto needs.
It is, after all, a non-romantic work ( even with the big, juicy melody of the second movement ) ; and the composer himself was called the age of steel pianist.
But granted all this, one still would have liked to have heard a little more tonal nuance than Mr. Skolovsky supplied.
Taken as a whole, though, it was a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra.
Mr. Skolovsky fully deserved the warm reception he received.
A new work on the program was Nikolai Lopatnikoff's Festival Overture, receiving its first New York hearing.
This was composed last year as a salute to the automobile industry.
It is not program music, though.
It runs a little more than ten minutes, is workmanlike, busy, methodical and featureless.
La Gioconda, like it or not, is a singer's opera.
And so, of course, it is a fan's opera as well.
Snow or no, the fans were present in force at the Metropolitan Opera last night for a performance of the Ponchielli work.
So the plot creaks, the sets are decaying, the costumes are pre-historic, the orchestra was sloppy and not very well connected with what the singers were doing.
After all, the opera has juicy music to sing and the goodies are well distributed, with no less than six leading parts.
One of those parts is that of evil, evil Barnaba, the spy.
His wicked deeds were carried on by Anselmo Colzani, who was taking the part for the first time with the company.
He has the temperament and the stage presence for a rousing villain and he sang with character and strong tone.
What was lacking was a real sense of phrase, the kind of legato singing that would have added a dimension of smoothness to what is, after all, a very oily character.
Regina Resnik as Laura and Cesare Siepi as Alvise also were new to the cast, but only with respect to this season ; they have both sung these parts here before.
Laura is a good role for Miss Resnik, and she gave it force, dramatic color and passion.
Mr. Siepi was, as always, a consummate actor ; with a few telling strokes he characterized Alvise magnificently.
Part of this characterization was, of course, accomplished with the vocal chords.
His singing was strong and musical ; unfortunately his voice was out of focus and often spread in quality.
Eileen Farrell in the title role, Mignon Dunn as La Cieca and Richard Tucker as Enzo were holdovers from earlier performances this season, and all contributed to a vigorous performance.
If only they and Fausto Cleva in the pit had got together a bit more.
Melodious birds sing madrigals saith the poet and no better description of the madrigaling of the Deller Consort could be imagined.
Their Vanguard album Madrigal Masterpieces ( B*g 609 ; stereo *j 5031 ) is a good sample of the special, elegant art of English madrigal singing.
It also makes a fine introduction to the international art form with good examples of Italian and English madrigals plus several French chansons.
The English have managed to hold onto their madrigal tradition better than anyone else.
The original impulses came to England late ( in the sixteenth century ) and continue strong long after everyone else had gone on to the baroque basso continuo, sonatas, operas and the like.
Even after Elizabethan traditions were weakened by the Cromwellian interregnum, the practice of singing together -- choruses, catches and glees -- always flourished.
The English never again developed a strong native music that could obliterate the traces of an earlier great age the way, say, the opera in Italy blotted out the Italian madrigal.
Early interest latter-day interest in Elizabethan singing dates well back into the nineteenth century in England, much ahead of similar revivals in other countries.
As a result no comparable literature of the period is better known and better studied nor more often performed than the English madrigal.
Naturally, Mr. Deller and the other singers in his troupe are most charming and elegant when they are squarely in their tradition and singing music by their countrymen : William Byrd, Thomas Morley and Thomas Tomkins.
There is an almost instrumental quality to their singing, with a tendency to lift out important lines and make them lead the musical texture.
Both techniques give the music purity and clarity.
Claude Jannequin's vocal description of a battle ( the French equivalents of tarantara, rum-tum-tum, and boom-boom-boom are very picturesque ) is lots of fun, and the singers get a sense of grace and shape into other chansons by Jannequin and Lassus.
Only with the more sensual, intense and baroque expressions of Marenzio, Monteverdi and Gesualdo does the singing seem a little superficial.
Nevertheless, the musicality, accuracy and infectious charm of these performances, excellently reproduced, make it an attractive look-see at the period.
The works are presented chronologically.
Texts and translations are provided.
Elegance and color the elements of elegance and color in Jannequin are strong French characteristics.
Baroque instrumental music in Italy and Germany tends to be strong, lively, intense, controlled and quite abstract.
In France, it remained always more picturesque, more dancelike, more full of flavor.
Couperin and Rameau gave titles to nearly everything they wrote, not in the later sense of program music but as a kind of nonmusical reference for the close, clear musical forms filled with keen wit and precise utterance.
Both composers turn up on new imports from France.
B*a*m is the unlikely name of a French recording company whose full label is Editions De La boite A Musique.
They specialize in out-of-the-way items and old French music naturally occupies a good deal of their attention.
Sonates et Concerts Royaux of Couperin Le Grand occupy two disks ( *j and *j and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master -- delicate, flexible and gemlike.
The Concerts -- nos. 2, 6, 9, 10 and 14 are represented -- are really closer to chamber suites than to concertos in the Italian sense.
The sonatas, La Francaise, La Sultane, L'*astree and L'*imperiale, are often more elaborately worked out and, in fact, show a strong Italian influence.
Couperin also turns up along with some lesser-known contemporaries on a disk called Musique Francaise Du 18e Siecle ( B*a*m 060 ).
Jean-*marie Le*clair still is remembered a bit, but Bodin De Beismortier, Corrette and Mondonville are hardly household words.
What is interesting about these chamber works here is how they all reveal the aspect of French music that was moving toward the rococo.
The Couperin La Steinkerque, with its battle music, brevity, wit and refined simplicity, already shakes off Corelli and points towards the mid-century elegances that ended the baroque era.
If Couperin shows the fashionable trend, the others do so all the more.
All these records have close, attractive sound and the performances by a variety of instrumentalists is characteristic.
Rameau's Six Concerts En Sextuor, recorded by L'orchestre De Chambre Pierre Menet ( B*a*m 046 ), turn out to be harpsichord pieces arranged for strings apparently by the composer himself.
The strange, delightful little character pieces with their odd and sometimes inexplicable titles are still evocative and gracious.
Maitres Allemands Des 17e et 18e Siecles contains music by Pachelbel, Buxtehude, Rosenmueller and Telemann, well performed by the Ensemble Instrumental Sylvie Spycket ( B*a*m 035 ).
Rococo music -- a lot of it -- was played in Carnegie Recital Hall on Saturday night in the first of four concerts being sponsored this season by a new organization known as Globe Concert Arts.
Works by J. C. Bach, Anton Craft, Joseph Haydn, Giuseppe Sammartini, Comenico Dragonetti and J. G. Janitsch were performed by seven instrumentalists including Anabel Brieff, flutist, Josef Marx, oboist, and Robert Conant, pianist and harpsichordist.
Since rococo music tends to be pretty and elegant above all, it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ears that have grown accustomed to the stress and dissonances of composers from Beethoven to Boulez.
Thus there was really an excess of eighteenth-century charm as one of these light-weight pieces followed another on Saturday night.
Each might find a useful place in a varied musical program, but taken together they grew quite tiresome.
The performances were variable, those of the full ensemble being generally satisfying, some by soloists proving rather trying.
Ellie Mao, soprano, and Frederick Fuller, baritone, presented a program of folksongs entitled East Meets West in Carnegie Recital Hall last night.
They were accompanied by Anna Mi Lee, pianist.
Selections from fifteen countries were sung as solos and duets in a broad range of languages.
Songs from China and Japan were reserved exclusively for Miss Mao, who is a native of China, and those of the British Isles were sung by Mr. Fuller, who is English by birth.
This was not a program intended to illustrate authentic folk styles.
On the contrary, Miss Mao and Mr. Fuller chose many of their arrangements from the works of composers such as Mendelssohn, Dvorak, Canteloube, Copland and Britten.
There was, therefore, more musical substance in the concert than might have been the case otherwise.
The performances were assured, communicative and pleasingly informal.
What was omitted from A Neglected Education were those essentials known as the facts of life.
Chabrier's little one-act operetta, presented yesterday afternoon at Town Hall, is a fragile, precious little piece, very French, not without wit and charm.
The poor uneducated newlywed, a certain Gontran De Boismassif, has his problems in getting the necessary information.
The humor of the situation can be imagined.
It all takes place in the eighteenth century.
What a silly, artificial way of life, Chabrier and his librettists chuckle.
But they wish they could bring it back.
Chabrier's delightful music stands just at the point where the classical, rationalist tradition, ( handed down to Chabrier largely in the form of operetta and salon music ) becomes virtually neo-classicism.
The musical cleverness and spirit plus a strong sense of taste and measure save a wry little joke from becoming either bawdy or mawkish.
The simple, clever production was also able to tread the thin line between those extremes.
Arlene Saunders was charming as poor Gontran.
Yes, Arlene is her name ; the work uses the old eighteenth-century tradition of giving the part of a young inexperienced youth to a soprano.
Benita Valente was delightful as the young wife and John Parella was amusing as the tutor who failed to do all his tutoring.
The work was presented as the final event in the Town Hall Festival of Music.
It was paired with a Darius Milhaud opera, The Poor Sailor, set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau, a kind of Grand Guignol by the sea, a sailor returns, unrecognized, and gets done in by his wife.
With the exception of a few spots, Milhaud's music mostly churns away with his usual collection of ditties, odd harmonies, and lumbering, satiric orchestration.
Had a funny experience at Newport yesterday afternoon.
Sat there and as a woman sang, she kept getting thinner and thinner, right before my eyes, and the eyes of some 5,500 other people.
I make this observation about the lady, Miss Judy Garland, because she brought up the subject herself in telling a story about a British female reporter who flattered her terribly in London recently and then wrote in the paper the next day : Judy Garland has arrived in London.
She's not chubby.
She's not plump.
She's fat.
But who cares, when the lady sings?
Certainly not the largest afternoon audience Newport has ever had at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet.
They applauded every number, not only at its conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme -- sometimes at the first chord.
And Judy sang the lovely old familiar things which seemed, at times, a blessed relief from the way-out compositions of the progressive jazzmen who have dominated these proceedings.
Things like When You're Smiling, Almost Like Being In Love, Do It Again, Born To Wander, Alone Together, Who Cares?
, Puttin' On The Ritz, How Long Has This Been Going On?
And her own personal songs like The Man That Got Away, and the inevitable Over The Rainbow.
Miss Garland is not only one of the great singers of our time but she is one of the superb showmen.
At the start of her program there were evidences of pique.
She had held to the letter of her contract and didn't come onto the stage until well after 4 p.m., the appointed hour, although the Music at Newport people had tried to get the program underway at 3.
Then there was a bad delay in getting Mort Lindsey's 30-piece orchestra wedged into its chairs.
Along about 4:30, just when it was getting to be about time to turn the audience over and toast them on the other side, Judy came on singing, in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flapped in the wind.
Her bouffant coiffure was fortunately combed on the left which happened to be the direction from which a brisk breeze was blowing.
In her first song she waved away one encroaching photographer who dared approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boys with the cameras had to unsheathe their 300 mm. lenses and shoot at extreme range.
There also came a brief contretemps with the sound mixers who made the mistake of being overheard during a quiet moment near the conclusion of Do It Again, and she made the tart observation that I never saw so much moving about in an audience.
But it didn't take Judy Garland, showman, long to realize that this sort of thing was par for the course at Newport and that you have to learn to live with it.
Before her chore was finished she was rescuing wind-blown sheets of music, trundling microphones about the stage, helping to move the piano and otherwise joining in the informal atmosphere.
And time after time she really belted out her songs.
Sometimes they struck me as horribly over-arranged -- which was the way I felt about her Come Rain or Come Shine -- and sometimes they were just plain magnificent, like her shatteringly beautiful Beautiful Weather.
To her partisan audience, such picayune haggling would have seemed nothing more than a critic striving to hold his franchise ; they just sat back on their haunches and cried for more, as though they could never get enough.
They were rewarded with splendid, exciting, singing.
Her Rockabye Your Baby was as good as it can be done, and her really personal songs, like The Man That Got Away were deeply moving.
The audience wouldn't let her leave until it had heard Over The Rainbow -- although the fellow that kept crying for Get Happy had to go home unhappy, about that item anyway.
She was generous with her encores and the audience was equally so with its cheers and applause and flowers.
All went home happy except the Newport police, who feared that the throng departing at 6:35 might meet head-on the night crowd drawing nigh, and those deprived of their happy hour at the cocktail bar.
In Newport last night there were flashes of distant lightning in the northern skies.
This was perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the evening -- flashes in the distance, but no storm.
Several times it came near breaking, and there were in fact some lovely peals of thunder from Jerry Mulligan's big band, which is about as fine an aggregation as has come along in the jazz business since John Hammond found Count Basie working in a Kansas City trap.
Mulligan's band has been infected with his solid sense of swing, and what it does seems far more meaningful than most of the noise generated by the big concert aggregations.
But what is equally impressive is the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and Mulligan's baritone sax in a fragile ballad like Bob Brookmeyer's arrangement of Django's Castle.
For subtle swinging rhythms, I could admire intensely Mulligan's version of Weep, and the fireworks went on display in 18 Carrots For Robert, a sax tribute to Johnny Hodges.
There was considerable contrast between this Mulligan performance and that of Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers, who are able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group.
Unfortunately, Blakey doesn't choose to work much of the time in this vein.
He prefers to have his soloist performing and thus we get only brief glimpses of what his ensemble work is like.
What we did get, however, was impressive.
A few drops of rain just before midnight, when Sarah Vaughan was in the midst of her first number, scattered the more timid members of the audience briefly, but at this hour and with Sarah on the stand, most of the listeners didn't care whether they got wet.
Miss Vaughan was back in top form, somehow mellowed and improved with the passage of time -- like a fine wine.
After the spate of female vocalists we have been having, all of whom took Sarah as a point of departure and then tried to see what they could do that might make her seem old hat, it seemed that all that has happened is to make the real thing seem better than ever.
Jazz Three open program the evening program was opened by the Jazz Three, a Newport group consisting of Steve Budieshein on bass, Jack Warner, drums, and Don Cook, piano.
This was a continuation of a good idea which was first tried out Saturday night when the Eddie Stack group, also local talent, went on first.
Putting on local musicians at this place in the program serves a triple purpose : it saves the top flight jazz men from being wasted in this unenviable spot, when the audience is cold, restless, and in flux ; it prevents late-comers from missing some of the people they have come a long way to hear, and it gives the resident musicians a chance to perform before the famous Newport audience.
The Jazz Three displayed their sound musicianship, not only in their own chosen set, but as the emergency accompanists for Al Minns & Leon James, the superb jazz dancers who have now been Newport performers for three successive years, gradually moving up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blues to a spot on the evening program.
Julie Wilson sings Julie Wilson, a vigorous vocalist without many wild twists, sang a set, a large part of which consisted of such seldom heard old oldies as Hard-*hearted Hannah, The Vamp Of Savannah, and the delightful Sunday.
She frosted the cake with the always reliable Bill Bailey.
From this taste of the 1920s, we leaped way out to Stan Getz's private brand of progressive jazz, which did lovely, subtle things for Baubles, Bangles And Beads, and a couple of ballards.
Getz is a difficult musician to categorize.
He plays his sax principally for beauty of tone, rather than for scintillating flights of meaningless improvisations, and he has a quiet way of getting back and restating the melody after the improvising is over.
In this he is sticking with tradition, however far removed from it he may seem to be.
Shearing takes over George Shearing took over with his well disciplined group, a sextet consisting of vibes, guitar, bass, drums, Shearing's piano and a bongo drummer.
He met with enthusiastic audience approval, especially when he swung from jazz to Latin American things like the Mambo.
Shearing, himself, seemed to me to be playing better piano than in his recent Newport appearances.
A very casual, pleasant program -- one of those easy-going things that make Newport's afternoon programs such a relaxing delight -- was held again under sunny skies, hot sun, and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who came to Newport to hear music rather than go to the beach.
Divided almost equally into two parts, it consisted of The Evolution Of The Blues, narrated by Jon Hendricks, who had presented it last year at the Monterey, Calif., Jazz Festival, and an hour-long session of Maynard Ferguson and his orchestra, a blasting big band.
Hendricks' story was designed for children and he had a small audience of small children right on stage with him.
Tracing the blues from its African roots among the slaves who were brought to this country and the West Indies, he stressed the close relationship between the early jazz forms and the music of the Negro churches.
Surprise addition to help him on this religious aspect of primitive jazz he had Big Miller, as a preacher-singer and Hannah Dean, Gospel-singer, while Oscar Brown Jr., an extremely talented young man, did a slave auctioneer's call, a field-hands' work song, and a beautifully sung Negro lullaby, Brown Baby, which was one of the truly moving moments of the festival.
One of those delightful surprise additions, which so frequently occur in jazz programs, was an excellent stint at the drums by the great Joe Jones, drumming to Old Man River, which seems to have been elected the favorite solo for the boys on the batterie at this year's concerts.
Demonstrating the primitive African rhythmic backgrounds of the Blues was Michael Babatunde Olatunji, who plays such native drums as the konga and even does a resounding job slapping his own chest.
He has been on previous Newport programs and was one of the sensations of last year's afternoon concerts.
Hendricks had Billy Mitchell, tenor sax ; Pony Poindexter, alto sax ; Jimmy Witherspoon, Blues singer ( and a good one ), and the Ike Isaacs Trio, which has done such wonderful work for two afternoons now, helping him with the musical examples.
It all went very well.
Pianists who are serious about their work are likely to know the interesting material contained in Schubert's Sonatas.
Music lovers who are not familiar with this literature may hear an excellent example, played for *j by Emil Gilels.
He has chosen Sonata Op. 53 in *j.
The playing takes both sides of the disc.
Perhaps one of the reasons these Sonatas are not programmed more often is their great length.
Rhythmic interest, melodic beauty and the expansiveness of the writing are all qualities which hold one's attention with the Gilels playing.
His technique is ample and his musical ideas are projected beautifully.
The male chorus of the Robert Shaw Chorale sings Sea Shanties in fine style.
The group is superbly trained.
What a discussion can ensue when the title of this type of song is in question.
Do you say chantey, as if the word were derived from the French word chanter, to sing, or do you say shanty and think of a roughly built cabin, which derives its name from the French-*canadian use of the word chantier, with one of its meanings given as a boat-yard?
I say chantey.
Either way, the Robert Shaw chorus sings them in fine style with every colorful word and its musical frame spelled out in terms of agreeable listening.
If your favorite song is not here it must be an unfamiliar one.
The London label offers an operatic recital by Ettore Bastianini, a baritone whose fame is international.
Murray Louis and his dance company appeared at the Henry Street Playhouse on Friday and Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoons in the premiere of his latest work, Signal, and the repetition of an earlier one, Journal.
Signal is choreographed for three male dancers to an electronic score by Alwin Nikolais.
Its abstract decor is by John Hultberg.
Program note reads as follows : take hands ; this urgent visage beckons us.
Here, as in Journal, Mr. Louis has given himself the lion's share of the dancing, and there is no doubt that he is capable of conceiving and executing a wide variety of difficult and arresting physical movements.
Indeed, both Journal and Signal qualify as instructive catalogues of modern-dance calisthenics.
But chains of movements are not necessarily communicative, and it is in the realm of communication that the works prove disappointing.
One frequently has the feeling that the order of their movement combinations could be transposed without notable loss of effect, there is too little suggestion of organic relationship and development.
It may be, of course, that Mr. Louis is consciously trying to create works that anticipate an age of total automation.
But it may be, also, that he is merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time.
One thing is certain, however, and that is that he is far more slavish to the detailed accents, phrasings and contours of the music he deals with than a confident dance creator need be.
An American journey a brisk, satirical spoof of contemporary American mores entitled An American Journey was given its first New York performance at Hunter College Playhouse last night by the Helen Tamiris-*daniel Nagrin Dance Company.
Choreographed by Mr. Nagrin, the work filled the second half of a program that also offered the first New York showing of Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time as well as her Women's Song and Mr. Nagrin's Indeterminate Figure.
Eugene Lester assembled a witty and explicit score for An American Journey, and Malcolm Mc*cormick gave it sprightly imaginative costumes.
Mr. Nagrin has described four places, each with its scenery and people, added two diversions, and concluded with A Toccata for the Young, a refreshingly underplayed interpretation of rock'n'roll dancing.
The places could be anywhere, the idiosyncrasies and foibles observed there could be anybody's, and the laugh is on us all.
But we need not mind too much, because Mr. Nagrin has expressed it through movement that is diverting and clever almost all the way.
Miss Tamiris' Once Upon A Time is a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figures that bother them somehow.
Unfortunately, the man and woman were not made to appear very interesting at the outset and the menacing figures failed to make them any more so.
Nor did the dancing involved really seize the attention at any time.
The music here, Russell Smith's Tetrameron, sounded good.
All the performances of the evening were smooth and assured, and the sizable company, with Mr. Nagrin and Marion Scott as its leading dancers, seemed to be fine shape.
The Symphony Of The Air, greatly assisted by Van Cliburn, last night got its seven-concert Beethoven cycle at Carnegie Hall off to a good start.
At the same time the orchestra announced that next season it would be giving twenty-five programs at Carnegie, and that it would be taking these concerts to the suburbs, repeating each of them in five different communities.
This news, announced by Jerome Toobin, the orchestra's administrative director, brought applause from the 2,800 persons who filled the hall.
They showed they were glad that Carnegie would have a major orchestra playing there so often next season to take up the slack with the departure to Lincoln Center of the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Boston Symphony.
This season the orchestra has already taken a step toward the suburbs in that it is giving six subscription concerts for the Orchestral Society of Westchester in the County Center in White Plains.
The details of the suburban concerts next season, and the centers in which they will be given, will be announced later, Mr. Toobin said.
The concertos that Van Cliburn has been associated with in New York since his triumphant return from Russia in 1958 have been the Tchaikovsky, the Rachmaninoff Third, and the Prokofieff Third.
It was pleasant last night, therefore, to hear him do something else : a concerto he has recently recorded, The Emperor.
The young Texas pianist can make great chords ring out as well as anyone, so last night the massive sonorities of this challenging concerto were no hazard to him.
But they were not what distinguished his performance.
The elements that did were the introspective slow movement, the beautiful transition to the third movement, and the passages of filigree that laced through the bigger moments of the opening movement and the final Rondo.
Mr. Cliburn gave the slow movement some of the quality of a Chopin Nocturne.
Alfred Wallenstein, the conductor, sensitive accompanist that he is, picked up the idea and led the orchestra here with a sense of brooding, poetic mystery.
The collaboration was remarkable, as it was in both the other movements, too.
Mr. Wallenstein, who will lead all of the concerts in the cycle, also conducted the Leonore Overture No. 3 and the Fourth Symphony.
The orchestra was obviously on its mettle and it played most responsively.
And although there was plenty of vigor in the performance, the ensemble was at its best when the playing was soft and lyrical, yet full of the suppressed tension that is one of the hallmarks of Beethoven.
Igor Oistrakh will be the next soloist on Feb. 4.
There are times when one suspects that the songs that are dropped from musical shows before they reach Broadway may really be better than many of those that are left in.
Today, in the era of the integrated musical when an individual song must contribute to the over-all development of the show, it is understandable that a song, no matter how excellent it may be on its own terms, is cut out because it does not perform the function required of it.
In the more casually constructed musicals of the Nineteen Twenties and Nineteen Thirties there would seem to have been less reason for eliminating a song of merit.
Yet there is the classic case of the Gershwins' The Man I Love.
Deemed too static when it was first heard in Lady Be Good in Philadelphia in 1924, it was dropped from the score.
It was heard again in Philadelphia in 1927 in the first version of Strike Up The Band and again abandoned shortly before the entire show was given up.
It finally reached Broadway in the second and successful version of Strike Up The Band in 1929.
( still another song in Strike Up The Band -- I've Got A Crush On You -- was retrieved from a 1928 failure, Treasure Girl.
) second chance like the Gershwins, Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart were loath to let a good song get away from them.
If one of Mr. Rodgers' melodies seemed to deserve a better fate than interment in Boston or the obscurity of a Broadway failure, Mr. Hart was likely to deck it out with new lyrics to give it a second chance in another show.
Several of these double entries have been collected by Ben Bagley and Michael Mc*whinney, along with Rodgers and Hart songs that disappeared permanently en route to New York and others that reached Broadway but have not become part of the constantly heard Rodgers and Hart repertory, in a delightfully refreshing album, Rodgers And Hart Revisited ( Spruce Records, 505 Fifth Avenue, New York ).
Among the particular gems in this collection is the impudent opening song of The Garrick Gaieties, an impressive forecast of the wit and melody that were to come from Rodgers and Hart in the years that followed ; Dorothy Loudon's raucous listing of the attractions At The Roxy Music Hall from I Married An Angel ; and the incisive style with which Charlotte Rae delivers the top-drawer Hart lyrics of I Blush, a song that was cut from A Connecticut Yankee.
Altogether fifteen virtually unknown Rodgers and Hart songs are sung by a quintet of able vocalists.
Norman Paris has provided them with extremely effective orchestral accompaniment.
Turning to the current musical season on Broadway, the most widely acclaimed of the new arrivals, How To Succeed In Business Without Really Trying, has been transferred to an original cast album ( R. C. A. Victor 1066 ; stereo *j 1066 ) that has some entertaining moments, although it is scarcely as inventive as the praise elicited by the show might lead one to expect.
Robert Morse, singing with comically plaintive earnestness, carries most of the burden and is responsible for the high spots in Frank Loesser's score.
Rudy Vallee, who shares star billing with Mr. Morse, makes only two appearances.
He shares with Mr. Morse a parody of the college anthems he once sang while his second song is whisked away from him by Virginia Martin, a girl with a remarkably expressive yip in her voice.
In general, Mr. Loesser has done a more consistent job as lyricist than he has as composer.
Like Mr. Loesser, Jerry Herman is both composer and lyriist for Milk And Honey ( R. C. A. Victor *j 1065 ; stereo *j 1065 ), but in this case it is the music that stands above the lyrics.
For this story of an American couple who meet and fall in love in Israel, Mr. Herman has written songs that are warmly melodious and dance music that sparkles.
Resourceful voices there are the full-bodied, resourceful voices of Robert Weede, Mimi Benzell and Tommy Rall to make the most of Mr. Herman's lilting melodies and, for an occasional change of pace, the bright humor of Molly Picon.
Mr. Herman has managed to mix musical ideas drawn from Israel and the standard American ballad style in a manner that stresses the basic tunefulness of both idioms.
Not content to create only the music and lyrics, Noel Coward also wrote the book and directed Sail Away ( Capitol *j 1643 ; stereo *j 1643 ), a saga of life on a cruise ship that is not apt to be included among Mr. Coward's more memorable works.
The melodies flow along pleasantly, as Mr. Coward's songs usually do, but his lyrics have a tired, cut-to-a-familiar-pattern quality.
Elaine Stritch, who sings with a persuasively warm huskiness, belts some life into most of her songs, but the other members of the cast sound as lukewarm as Mr. Coward's songs.
With three fine Russian films in recent months on World War 2 -- The House I Live In, The Cranes Are Flying and Ballad Of A Soldier -- we had every right to expect a real Soviet block-buster in The Day The War Ended.
It simply isn't, not by a long shot.
The Artkino presentation, with English titles, opened on Saturday at the Cameo Theatre.
Make no mistake, this Gorky Studio drama is a respectable import -- aptly grave, carefully written, performed and directed.
In describing the initial Allied occupation of a middle-sized German city, the picture has color, pictorial pull and genuinely moving moments.
Told strictly from the viewpoint of the Russian conquerors, the film compassionately peers over the shoulders of a smitten Soviet couple, at both sides of the conflict's aftermath.
Unfortunately, the whole picture hinges on this romance, at the expense of everything else.
Tenderly and rather tediously, the camera rivets on the abrupt, deep love of a pretty nurse and a uniformed teacher, complicated by nothing more than a friend they don't want to hurt.
It's the old story, war or no war, and more than one viewer may recall Hollywood's Titanic, several seasons back, when the paramount concern was for the marital discord of a society dilettante.
Not that the picture is superficial.
Under Yakov Segal's direction, it begins stirringly, as crouching Soviet and Nazi troops silently scan each other, waiting for the first surrender gesture.
One high-up camera shot is magnificent, as the Germans straggle from a cathedral, dotting a huge, cobblestone square, and drop their weapons.
Ring Of Bright Water, by Gavin Maxwell.
211 pages.
Dutton.
$5.
Only once in a very long while comes a book that gives the reader a magic sense of sharing a rare experience.
Ring Of Bright Water by Gavin Maxwell is just that -- a haunting, warmly personal chronicle of a man, an otter, and a remote cottage in the Scottish West Highlands.
He has married me with a ring of bright water, begins the Kathleen Raine poem from which Maxwell takes his title, and it is this mystic bond between the human and natural world that the author conveys.
The place is Camusfearna, the site of a long-vanished sea-village opposite the isle of Skye.
It is a land of long fjords, few people, a single-lane road miles away -- and of wild stags, Greylag geese, wild swans, dolphins and porpoises playing in the waters.
How Maxwell recounts his first coming to Camusfearna, his furnishing the empty house with beach-drift, the subtle changes in season over ten years, is a moving experience.
Just the evocations of time and place, of passionate encounter between man and a natural world which today seems almost lost, would be enough.
But it isn't.
There is Mijbil, an otter who travelled with Maxwell -- and gave Maxwell's name to a new species -- from the Tigris marshes to his London flat.
It may sound extravagant to say that there has never been a more engaging animal in all literature.
This is not only a compliment to Mijbil, of whom there are a fine series of photographs and drawings in the book, but to the author who has catalogued the saga of a frightened otter cub's journey by plane from Iraq to London, then by train ( where he lay curled in the wash basin playing with the water tap ) to Camusfearna, with affectionate detail.
Mij, as his owner was soon to learn, had strange, inexplicable habits.
He liked to nip ear lobes of unsuspecting visitors with his needle-sharp teeth.
He preferred sleeping in bed with his head on a pillow.
Systematically he would open and ransack drawers.
Given a small ball or marbles, he would invent games and play by himself for hours.
With curiosity and elan, he explored every inch of glen, beach and burn, once stranding himself for hours on a ledge high up a sheer seventy-foot cliff and waiting with calm faith to be rescued by Maxwell, who nearly lost his life in doing so.
A year and a day of this idyll is described for the reader, one in which not only discovery of a new world of personality is charted, but self-discovery as well.
In the solitude of Camusfearna there had been no loneliness.
To be quite alone where there are no other human beings is sharply exhilarating ; it is as though some pressure had suddenly been lifted, allowing an intense awareness a sharpening of the senses.
Now, with the increasing interdependence between himself and Mij came a knowledge of an obscure need, that of being trusted implicitly by some creature.
Two other people in time shared Mijbil's love : it remained around us three that his orb revolved when he was not away in his own imponderable world of wave and water ; we were his Trinity, and he behaved towards us with a mixture of trust and abuse, passion and irritation.
In turn each of us in our own way depended, as gods do, upon his worship.
Yet the idyll ended.
The brief details of Mijbil's death lend depth to the story, give it an edge of ironic tragedy.
Man, to whom Mij gave endless affection and fealty, was responsible in the form of a road worker with a pickaxe who somehow becomes an abstract symbol of the savage in man.
But then, through a strange coincidence, Maxwell manages to acquire Idal, a female otter, and the fascinating story starts once more.
One is not sure who emerges as the main personality of this book -- Mijbil, with his rollicking ways, or Maxwell himself, poet, portrait painter, writer, journalist, traveller and zoologist, sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life, in a language at once lyrical and forceful, vivid and unabashed.
This reviewer read the book when it was first brought out in England with a sense of discovery and excitement.
Now Gavin Maxwell's Ring Of Bright Water has widened to enchant the world.
New York -- the performances of the Comedie Francaise are the most important recent events in the New York theater.
They serve to contradict a popular notion that the Comedie merely repeats, as accurately as possible, the techniques of acting the classics that prevailed in the 17th century.
On the contrary, the old plays are continually being reinterpreted, and each new production of a classic has only a brief history at the Comedie.
Of course, the well-received revivals last longer than the others, and that further reminds us that the Comedie is not insensitive to criticism.
The directors of the Comedie do not respond to adverse notices in as docile and subservient a manner as the Broadway producers who, in two instances this season, closed their plays after one performance.
But they are aware of the world outside, they court public approval, they delight in full houses, and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpreting a dramatic classic.
In France, novel approaches to the classic French plays are frequently attempted.
The government pays a subsidy for revival of the classics, and this policy attracts experimenters who sometimes put Moliere's characters in modern dress and often achieve interesting results.
So far as I know, the Comedie has never put Moliere's people in the costumes of the 20th century, but they do reinterpret plays and characters.
Last season, the Comedie's two principal experiments came to grief, and, in consequence, we can expect fairly soon to see still newer productions of Racine's Phedre and Moliere's School For Wives.
The new Phedre was done in 17th century setting, instead of ancient Greek ; perhaps that is the Comedie's equivalent for thrusting this play's characters into our own time.
The speaking of the lines seemed excessively slow and stately, possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance.
A few literary men defended what they took to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama, but the response was mainly hostile and quite violent.
The new School For Wives was interpreted according to a principle that is becoming increasingly common in the playing of classic comedy -- the idea of turning some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character.
Among the Moliere specialists of some years ago, Louis Jouvet tried to humanize some of the clowns, while Fernand Ledoux, often performing at the Comedie, made them more gross than Moliere may have intended.
Apparently, Jouvet and Ledoux attempted just these dissimilar approaches in the role of Arnolphe in The School For Wives.
I say apparently although I saw Jouvet as Arnolphe when he visited this country shortly before his death ; by that time, he seemed to have dropped the tragic playing of the last moments of the comedy.
Arnolphe, it will be recalled, is a man of mature years who tries to preserve the innocence of his youthful wife-to-be.
The part can lend itself to serious treatment ; one influential French critic remarked : pity for Arnolphe comes with age.
Accordingly, at the Comedie last year, Jean Meyer played a sympathetic Arnolphe and drew criticism for turning the comedy into a tragedy.
But the stuff of tragedy was not truly present and the play became only comedy acted rather slowly.
Wisely, the Comedie has brought Moliere's Tartuffe on its tour and has left The School For Wives at home.
Tartuffe is the religious hypocrite who courts his benefactor's wife.
Jouvet played him as a sincere zealot, and Ledoux, at the Comedie, made him a gross buffoon, or so the historians tell us.
Louis Seigner, who formerly played the deluded benefactor opposite Ledoux, is the Tartuffe of the present production, which he himself directed.
His Tartuffe observes the golden mean.
His red face, his coarse gestures, and his lustful stares bespeak his sensuality.
But his heavenward glances and his pious speeches are not merely perfunctory ; of course, they do not reflect sincerity, but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of his pious impersonation.
Occasionally, Seigner draws some justly deserved laughs by his quick shifts from one personality to another.
The whole role, by the way, is a considerable transformation for anyone who has seen Seigner in his other parts.
His normal specialty is playing the good-natured old man, frequently stupid or deluded but never mean or sly.
Here, he is, quite persuasively, the very embodiment of meanness and slyness.
Seigner is the dean of the company, the oldest actor in point of continuous service.
In that function, he helps to rebut another legend about the Comedie.
We are often told that the Comedie has, unfortunately, life-contracts with old actors who are both mediocre and lazy, drawing their pay without much acting but probably doing real service to the Comedie by staying off the stage.
Seigner, however, is a fine actor and probably the busiest man in the company ; among his other parts are the leads in The Bourgeois Gentleman and The Imaginary Invalid.
In Moliere's farce, The Tricks Of Scapin, Robert Hirsch undertakes another of the great roles.
Here some innovation is attempted.
To begin with, Scapin is a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plots the strategy of courtship for his master.
Hirsch's Scapin is healthy, cheerful, energetic, revelling in his physical agility and his obvious superiority to the young gentlemen whom he serves.
Hirsch says that he has given the role certain qualities he has observed in the city toughs of the real world.
And surely his Scapin has a fresh directness, a no-nonsense quality that seems to make him his own master and nobody's servant.
Django Reinhardt, the ill-fated gypsy, was a true artist, one who demonstrated conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channels.
There is hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who doesn't owe something to Django.
And Django owed much to Louis Armstrong.
He told once of how he switched his style of playing to jazz after listening to two old Armstrong records he bought in the Flea Market in Paris.
It was the first jazz he had heard.
Django, who was born Jean Baptiste Reinhardt in Belgium and who died in 1953 in France, was an extraordinary man.
Most of the fingers on his left hand were burned off when he fell asleep with a cigarette.
And this was before he began to play his startlingly beautiful jazz.
You can catch up with him -- if you haven't already -- on *j album.
Djangology, made up of tracks he recorded with Stephane Grappelly and the Quintet of the Hot Club of France.
This is a choice item and Grappely deserves mention too, of course.
He is one of the few men in history who plays jazz on a violin.
They play : Minor Swing, Honeysuckle Rose, Beyond The Sea, Bricktop, Heavy Artillery, Djangology, After You've Gone, Where Are You, My Love?
I Saw Stars, Lover Man, Menilmontant and Swing 42.
All this is great proceedings -- get the minutes.
Kid Ory, the trombonist chicken farmer, is also one of the solid anchor points of jazz.
He dates back to the days before the first sailing ship pulled into New Orleans.
His horn has blown loud and clear across the land for more years than he cares to remember.
Good Time Jazz has released a nice two-record album which he made.
He is starred against Alvin Alcorn, trumpet ; Phil Gomez, clarinet ; Cedric Haywood, piano ; Julian Davidson, guitar ; Wellman Braud, bass, and Minor Hall, drums.
The set contains High Society, Do What Ory Say, Down Home Rag, Careless Love, Jazz Me Blues, Weary Blues, Original Dixieland One-*step, Bourbon Street Parade, Panama, Toot, Toot, Tootsie, Oh Didn't He Ramble, Beale Street Blues, Maryland, My Maryland, 1919 Rag, Eh, La Bas, Mood Indigo, and Bugle Call Rag.
All this will serve to show off the Ory style in fine fashion and is a must for those who want to collect elements of the old-time jazz before it is too late to lay hands on the gems.
Mischa Elman shared last night's Lewisohn Stadium concert with three American composers.
His portion of the program -- and a big portion it was -- consisted of half the major nineteenth-century concertos for the violin : to wit, the Mendelssohn and the Tchaikovsky.
That is an evening of music-making that would faze many a younger man ; Mr. Elman is 70 years old.
There were 8,000 persons at the Stadium who can tell their grandchildren that they heard Elman.
But, with all due respects and allowances, it must truthfully be said that what they heard was more syrupy than sweet, more mannered than musical.
The occasion was sentimental ; so was the playing.
The American part of the evening consisted of Paul Creston's Dance Overture, William Schuman's Chester From New England Triptych and two works of Wallingford Riegger, Dance Rhythms, Op. 58, and a Romanza For Strings, Op. 56*a.
The Creston is purely a potboiler, with Spanish, English, French and American dances mixed into the stew.
The Riegger, with its Latin hesitation bounce, is just this side of the pale ; like his sweet, attractive Romanza, it belongs to what the composer called his Non-*dissonant ( mostly ) category of works.
The Schuman Chester takes off from an old William Billings tune with rousing woodwind and brass effect.
All these -- potboilers or no -- provided a welcome breath of fresh air in the form of lively, colorful, unstuffy works well suited for the great out-of-doors.
It was nice to have something a little up-to-date for a change.
We have Alfredo Antonini to thank for this healthy change of diet as well as the lively performances of the Stadium Symphony.
A woman who undergoes artificial insemination against the wishes of her husband is the unlikely heroine of A Question Of Adultery, yesterday's new British import at the Apollo.
Since an objective viewer might well conclude that this is not a situation that would often arise, the film's extensive discussion of the problem seems, at best, superfluous.
In its present artless, low-budget form, the subject matter seems designed to invite censorial wrath.
With Julie London enacting the central role with husky-voiced sincerity, the longsuffering heroine is at least attractive.
The explanation offered for her conduct is a misguided attempt to save her marriage to a neurotic husband left sterile as a result of an automobile accident.
Anthony Steel, as the husband, is a jealous type who argues against her course and sues for divorce, labeling her action adulterous.
The actor plays his role glumly under the lurid direction of Don Chaffey, as do Basil Sydney as his unsympathetic father and Anton Diffring as an innocent bystander.
After a protracted, hysterical trial scene more notable for the frankness of its language than for dramatic credibility, the jury, to no one's surprise, leaves the legal question unresolved.
When the husband drops the case and returns to his wife, both seem sorry they brought the matter up in the first place.
So was the audience.
London, July 4 for its final change of bill in its London season, the Leningrad State Kirov Ballet chose tonight to give one of those choreographic miscellanies known as a gala program at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.
No doubt the underlying idea was to show that for all the elegance and artistry that have distinguished its presentations thus far, it too could give a circus if it pleased.
And please it did, in every sense of the word, for it had the audience shouting much of the time in a manner far from typical of London audiences.
At the end of the program, indeed, there was a demonstration that lasted for forty-five minutes, and nothing could stop it.
Alexandre Livshitz repeated a fantastic technical bit from the closing number, Taras Bulba, but even then there was a substantial number of diehards who seemed determined not to go home at all.
Only a plea from the house manager, John Collins, finally broke up the party.
But for all the manifest intention to show off, this was a circus with a difference, for instead of descending in quality to what is known as a popular level, it added further to the evidence that this is a very great dancing company.
The Taras Bulba excerpt is a rousing version of Gogol's Ukrainian folk-tale choreographed by Bo Fenster to music of Soloviev-*sedoi.
It is danced by some thirty-five men and no women, and it contains everything in the books -- lusty comedy, gregarious cavorting, and tricks that only madmen or Russians would attempt to make the human body perform.
Yuri Soloviev, Oleg Sokolov, Alexei Zhitkov, Lev Sokolov, Yuri Korneyev and Mr. Livshitz were the chief soloists, but everybody on stage was magnificent.
At the other extreme in character was the half-hour excerpt from the Petipa-*minkus ballet Bayaderka, which opened the evening.
What a man this Petipa was ] and why do we in the West know so few of his ballets?
This scene is a white ballet in which a lovelorn hero searches for his departed love's spirit among twenty-eight extraordinarily beautiful shadows who can all dance like nothing human -- which, of course, is altogether fitting.
The ensemble enters in a long adagio passage that is of fantastic difficulty, as well as loveliness, and adagio is the general medium of the piece.
Its ballerina, Olga Moiseyeva, performs simple miracles of beauty, and Ludmilla Alexeyeva, Inna Korneyeva and Gabrielle Komleva make up a threesome of exquisite accomplishments.
Sergei Vikulov, as the lone male, meets the competition well with some brilliant hits, but the work is designed to belong to the ladies.
The middle section of the program was made up of short numbers, naturally enough of unequal merit, but all of them pretty good at that.
They consisted of a new arrangement of Nutcracker excerpts danced stunningly by Irina Kolpakova and Mr. Sokolev, with a large ensemble ; a winning little Snow Maiden variation by the adorable Galina Kekisheva ; two of those poetic adagios in Greek veils ( and superb esthetic acrobacy ) by Alla Osipenko and Igor Chernishev in one case and Inna Zubkovskaya and Yuri Kornevey in the other ; an amusing character pas de cinq called Gossiping Women ; a stirring Flames Of Paris pas de deux by Xenia Ter-*stepanova and Alexandre Pavlovsky, and a lovely version of Fokine's Le Cygne by Olga Moiseyeva, which had to be repeated.
Vadim Kalentiev was the conductor.
It was quite an evening ] a year ago today, when the Democrats were fretting and frolicking in Los Angeles and John F. Kennedy was still only an able and ambitious Senator who yearned for the power and responsibility of the Presidency, Theodore H. White had already compiled masses of notes about the Presidential campaign of 1960.
As the pace of the quadrennial American political festival accelerated, Mr. White took more notes.
He traveled alternately with Mr. Kennedy and with Richard M. Nixon.
He asked intimate questions and got frank answers from the members of what he calls the candidates' in-groups.
He assembled quantities of facts about the nature of American politics in general, as well as about the day-to-day course of the closest Presidential election in American history.
Those of us who read the papers may think we know a good deal about that election ; how little we know of what there is to be known is made humiliatingly clear by Mr. White in The Making Of The President 1960.
This is a remarkable book and an astonishingly interesting one.
What might have been only warmed-over topical journalism turns out to be an eyewitness contribution to history.
Mr. White, who is only a competent novelist, is a brilliant reporter.
His zest for specific detail, his sensitivity to emotional atmosphere, his tireless industry and his crisply turned prose all contribute to the effectiveness of his book.
A lesson in politics as a dramatic narrative The Making Of The President 1960 is continuously engrossing.
And as an introduction to American politics it is highly educational.
The author begins this volume with a close-up of Mr. Kennedy, his family and his entourage waiting for the returns.
He then switches back to a consideration of the seven principal Presidential hopefuls : five Democrats -- Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, Senator Stuart Symington, Senator Lyndon B. Johnson, Adlai E. Stevenson and Mr. Kennedy -- and two Republicans -- Governor Rockefeller and Mr. Nixon.
Then, in chronological order, Mr. White covers the primary campaigns, the conventions and the Presidential campaign itself.
In the process he writes at length about many related matters : the importance of race, religion, local tradition, bosses, organizations, zealous volunteers and television.
Mr. White is bluntly frank in his personal opinions.
He frequently cites intimate details that seem to come straight from the horse's mouth, from numerous insiders and from Mr. Kennedy himself ; but never from Mr. Nixon, who looked on reporters with suspicion and distrust.
Rarely in American history has there been a political campaign that discussed issues less or clarified them less, says Mr. White.
Mr. Nixon, he believes, has no particular political philosophy and mismanaged his own campaign.
Although a skillful politician and a courageous and honest man, Mr. Nixon, Mr. White believes, ignored his own top-level planners, wasted time and effort in the wrong regions, missed opportunities through indecision and damaged his chances on television.
Mr. Nixon is a broody, moody man, given to long stretches of introspection ; he trusts only himself and his wife.
He is a man of major talent -- but a man of solitary, uncertain impulses.
He was above all a friend seeker, almost pathetic in his eagerness to be liked.
He wanted to identify with people and have a connection with them ; the least inspiring candidate since Alfred M. Landon.
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. White believes, had mastered politics on so many different levels that no other American could match him.
Calm, dignified, composed, superbly eloquent, Mr. Kennedy always knew everything about everybody.
He enlisted a staff of loyal experts and of many zealous volunteers.
Every decision was made quickly on sound grounds.
Efficiency was enforced and nothing was left to chance.
Mr. Kennedy did not neglect to cultivate the personal friendship of reporters.
Mr. White admires him profoundly and leaves no doubt that he is a Democrat himself who expects Mr. Kennedy to be a fine President.
Pressures portrayed throughout The Making Of A President Mr. White shows wonderfully well how the pressures pile up on candidates, how decisions have constantly to be made, how fatigue and illness and nervous strain wear candidates down, how subordinates play key roles.
And he makes many interesting comments.
Here are several : the root question in American politics is always : who's the man to see?
To understand American politics is, simply, to know people, to know the relative weight of names -- who are heroes, who are straw men, who controls, who does not.
But to operate in American politics one must go a step further -- one must build a bridge to such names, establish a warmth, a personal connection.
In the hard life of politics it is well known that no platform nor any program advanced by either major American party has any purpose beyond expressing emotion.
All platforms are meaningless : the program of either party is what lies in the vision and conscience of the candidate the party chooses to lead it.
Nostalgia week at Lewisohn Stadium, which had begun with the appearance of the 70-year-old Mischa Elman on Tuesday night, continued last night as Lily Pons led the list of celebrities in an evening of French operatic excerpts.
Miss Pons is certainly not 70 -- no singer ever is -- and yet the rewards of the evening again lay more in paying tribute to a great figure of times gone by than in present accomplishments.
The better part of gallantry might be, perhaps, to honor her perennial good looks and her gorgeous rainbow-hued gown, and to chide the orchestra for not playing in the same keys in which she had chosen to sing.
No orchestra, however, could be expected to follow a singer through quite as many adventures with pitch as Miss Pons encountered last night.
In all fairness, there were flashes of the great stylist of yesteryear, flashes even of the old consummate vocalism.
One such moment came in the breathtaking way Miss Pons sang the cadenza to Meyerbeer's Shadow Song.
The years suddenly fell away at this point.
On the whole, however, one must wonder at just what it is that forces a beloved artist to besmirch her own reputation as time marches inexorably on.
Sharing the program was the young French-*canadian tenor Richard Verreau, making his stadium debut on this occasion.
Mr. Verreau began shakily, with a voice that tended toward an unpleasant whiteness when pushed beyond middle volume.
Later on this problem vanished, and the Flower Song from Bizet's Carmen was beautifully and intelligently projected.
Radio is easily outdistancing television in its strides to reach the minority listener.
Lower costs and a larger number of stations are the key factors making such specialization possible.
The mushrooming of *j outlets, offering concerts ( both jazz and classical ), lectures, and other special events, is a phenomenon which has had a fair amount of publicity.
Not so well known is the growth of broadcasting operations aimed wholly or partly at Negro listeners -- an audience which, in the United States, comprises some 19,000,000 people with $20,000,000,000 to spend each year.
Of course, the nonwhite listener does his share of television watching.
He even buys a lot of the products he sees advertised -- despite the fact that the copy makes no special bid for his favor and sponsors rarely use any but white models in commercials.
But the growing number of Negro-appeal radio stations, plus evidence of strong listener support of their advertisers, give time salesmen an impressive argument as they approach new prospects.
It is estimated that more than 600 stations ( of a total of 3,400 ) do a significant amount of programing for the Negro.
At least 60 stations devote all of their time to reaching this audience in about half of the 50 states.
These and other figures and comments have been reported in a special supplement of Sponsor magazine, a trade publication for radio and *j advertisers.
For 10 years Sponsor has issued an annual survey of the size and characteristics of the Negro market and of successful techniques for reaching this market through radio.
In the past 10 years, Sponsor observes, these trends have become apparent : Negro population in the U.*s. has increased 25 per cent while the white population was growing by 18 per cent.
The forgotten 15 million -- as Sponsor tagged the Negro market in its first survey -- has become a better-remembered 19 million.
Advertisers are changing their attitudes, both as to the significance of this market and the ways of speaking to it.
Stations programing to Negro listeners are having to upgrade their shows in order to keep pace with rising educational, economic, and cultural levels.
Futhermore, the station which wants real prestige must lead or participate in community improvement projects, not simply serve on the air.
In the last decade the number of Negro-appeal radio program hours has risen at least 15 per cent, and the number of Negro-appeal stations has increased 30 per cent, according to a research man quoted by Sponsor.
A year ago the Negro Radio Association was formed to spur research which the 30-odd member stations are sure will bring in more business.
The 1960 census underscored the explosive character of the population growth.
It also brought home proof of something a casual observer might have missed : that more than half of the U.*s. Negroes live outside the southeastern states.
Also, the state with the largest number of Negroes is New York -- not in the South at all.
In New York City, *j boasts more community service programs than any other Negro station and one of the largest Negro news staffs in America.
And *j colorful mobile unit, cruising predominately Negro neighborhoods, is a frequent reminder of that station's round-the-clock dedication to nonwhite interests.
Recently, *j won praise for its expose of particular cases of employment agency deceit.
A half-dozen other stations in the New York area also bid for attention of the city's Negro population, up about 50 per cent in the past decade.
In all big cities outside the South, and even in small towns within the South, radio stations can be found beaming some or all of their programs at Negro listeners.
The Keystone Broadcasting System's Negro network includes 360 affiliated stations, whose signals reach more than half the total U.*s. Negro population.
One question which inevitably crops up is whether such stations have a future in a nation where the Negro is moving into a fully integrated status.
Whatever the long-range impact of integration, the owners of Negro-appeal radio stations these days know they have an audience and that it is loyal.
Advertisers have discovered the tendency of Negroes to shop for brand names they have heard on stations catering to their special interests.
And many advertisers have been happy with the results of letting a Negro disc jockey phrase the commercial in his own words, working only from a fact sheet.
What sets Negro-appeal programing apart from other radio shows?
Sponsor magazine notes the stress on popular Negro bands and singers ; rhythm-and-blues mood music ; race music, folk songs and melodies, and gospel programs.
Furthermore, news and special presentations inform the listener about groups, projects, and personalities rarely mentioned on a general-appeal station.
Advertising copy frequently takes into account matters of special Negro concern.
Sponsor quotes John Mc*lendon of the Mc*lendon-*ebony station group as saying that the Southern Negro is becoming conscious of quality and does not wish to be associated with radio which is any way degrading to his race ; he tends to shy away from the hooting and hollering personalities that originally made Negro radio programs famous.
The sociological impact is perhaps most eloquently summed up in this quotation of J. Walter Carroll of *j, San Francisco : Negro-appeal radio is more important to the Negro today, because it provides a direct and powerful mirror in which the Negro can hear and see his ambitions, achievements and desires.
It will continue to be important as a means of orientation to the Negro, seeking to become urbanized, as he tries to make adjustment to the urban life.
Negro radio is vitally necessary during the process of assimilation.
Presentation of The Life And Times Of John Sloan in the Delaware Art Center here suggests a current nostalgia for human values in art.
Staged by way of announcing the gift of a large and intimate Sloan collection by the artist's widow, Helen Farr Sloan, to the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts, the exhibition presents a survey of Sloan's work.
From early family portraits, painted before he entered the schools of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the chronology extends to a group of paintings executed in his last year ( 1951 ) and still part of his estate.
Few artists have left a life work so eloquent of the period in which they lived.
Few who have painted the scenes around them have done so with so little bitterness.
The paintings, drawings, prints, and illustrations all reflect the manners, costumes, and mores of America in the first half of the present century.
Obviously Sloan's early years were influenced by his close friend Robert Henri.
As early as 1928, however, the Sloan style began to change.
The dark pigments of the early work were superseded by a brighter palette.
The solidity of brush stroke yielded to a hatching technique that finally led to virtual abandonment of American genres in favor of single figure studies and studio nudes.
The exhibition presents all phases of Sloan's many-sided art.
In addition to the paintings are drawings, prints, and illustrations.
Sloan created such works for newspaper supplements before syndication threw him out of a job and sent him to roam the streets of New York, thereby building for America an incomparable city survey from paintings of Mc*sorley's Saloon to breezy clotheslines on city roofs.
One of the most appealing of the rooftop canvases is Sun And Wind On The Roof, with a woman and child bracing themselves against flapping clothes and flying birds.
Although there are landscapes in the show ( one of the strongest is a vista of Gloucester Harbor in 1915 ), the human element was the compelling factor in Sloan's art.
Significant are such canvases as Bleeker Street, Saturday Night, with its typically American crowd ( Sloan never went abroad ) ; the multifigure Traveling Carnival, in which action is vivified by lighting ; or Carmine Theater, 1912, the only canvas with an ash can ( and foraging dog ), although Sloan was a member of the famous Eight, and of the so-called Ash-*can School, a term he resented.
Not all the paintings, however, are of cities.
The exhibition touches briefly on his sojourn in the Southwest ( Koshare in the Dust, a vigorous Indian dance, and landscapes suggest the influence of western color on his palette ).
The fact that Sloan was an extrovert, concerned primarily with what he saw, adds greatly to the value of his art as a human chronicle.
There are 151 items in the Wilmington show, including one painting by each member of the Eight, as well as work by Sloan's friends and students.
Supplementing the actual art are memorabilia -- correspondence, diaries, books from the artist's library, etc..
All belong to the collection being given to Wilmington over a period of years by Mrs. Sloan, who has cherished such revelatory items ever since she first studied with Sloan at the Art Students League, New York, in the 1920's.
To enable students and the public to spot Sloan forgeries, the Delaware Art Center ( according to its director, Bruce St. John ) will maintain a complete file of photographs of all Sloan works, as well as a card index file.
The entire Sloan collection will be made available at the center to all serious art students and historians.
The current exhibition, which remains on view through Oct. 29, has tapped 14 major collections and many private sources.
Any musician playing Beethoven here, where Beethoven was born, is likely to examine his own interpretations with special care.
In a sense, he is offering Bonn what its famous son ( who left as a youth ) never did -- the sound of the composer's mature style.
Robert Riefling, who gave the only piano recital of the recently concluded 23rd Beethoven Festival, penetrated deep into the spirit of the style.
His readings were careful without being fussy, and they were authoritative without being presumptuous.
The 32 *j Minor Variations with which he opened moved fluently yet logically from one to another, leaving the right impression of abundance under discipline.
The *j Minor Sonata, Op. 31 No. 2, introduced by dynamically shaped arpeggios, was most engaging in its moments of quasi-recitative -- single lines in which the fingers seemed to be feeling their way toward the idea to come.
These inwardly dramatic moments showed the kind of opera style of which Beethoven was genuinely capable, but which did not take so kindly to the mechanics of staging.
Two late Sonatas, Op. 110 and 111, were played with similar insight, the disarming simplicities of the Op. 111 Adagio made plain without ever becoming obvious.
The two were separated from each other by the Six Bagatelles of Op. 126.
Herr Riefling, in everything he gave his large Beethoven Hall audience, proved himself as an interpreter of unobtrusive authority.
Volker Wangenheim, who conducted Bonn's Stadtisches Orchester on the following evening, made one more conscious of the process of interpretation.
Herr Wangenheim has only recently become the city's music director, and is a young man with a clear flair for the podium.
But he weighted the Eighth Symphony, at times, with a shuddering subjectivity which seemed considerably at odds with the music.
He might have been hoping, to all appearances, that this relatively sunny symphony, in conjunction with the Choral Fantasy at the end of the program, could amount to something like the Ninth ; but no amount of head-tossing could make it so.
The conductor's preoccupation with the business of starting and stopping caused occasional raggedness, as with the first orchestra entrance in the Fourth Piano Concerto, but when he put his deliberations and obsequies aside and let the music move as designed, it did so with plenty of spring.
The concerto's soloist, Hans Richter-*haaser, played with compensatory ease and economy, though without the consummate plasticity to which we had been treated on the previous evening by Herr Riefling.
His was a burgomaster's Beethoven, solid and sensible.
Everybody returned after intermission for the miscellaneous sweepings of the Fantasy For Piano, Chorus, And Orchestra In *j Minor, made up by its composer to fill out one of his programs.
The entrance of the Stadtisches Gesangverein ( Bonn's civic chorus ) was worth all the waiting, however, as the young Rhenish voices finally brought the music to life.
The last program of this festival, which during two weeks had sampled most compositional categories, brought the Cologne Rundfunk-*sinfonie-*orchesternp and Rundfunkchor to Bonn's gold-filled hall for a performance of the Missa Solemnis.
A tribe in ancient India believed the earth was a huge tea tray resting on the backs of three giant elephants, which in turn stood on the shell of a great tortoise.
This theory eventually proved inexact.
But the primitive method of explaining the unknown with what is known bears at least a symbolic resemblance to the methods of modern science.
It is the business of cosmologists, the scientists who study the nature and structure of the universe, to try to solve the great cosmic mysteries by using keys that have clicked open other doors.
These keys are the working principles of physics, mathematics and astronomy, principles which are then extrapolated, or projected, to explain phenomena of which we have little or no direct knowledge.
In the autumn of 1959, the British Broadcasting Corporation presented a series of talks by four scientists competent in cosmology.
Three of these men discussed major theories of the universe while the other acted as a moderator.
The participants were Professor H. Bondi, professor of mathematics at King's College, London ; Dr. W. B. Bonnor, reader in mathematics at Queen Elizabeth College, London ; Dr. R. A. Lyttleton, a lecturer at St. John's College, Cambridge, and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the University of Cambridge ; and Dr. G. J. Whitrow, reader in applied mathematics at the Imperial College of Science and Technology, London.
Dr. Whitrow functioned as moderator.
The programs were so well received by the British public that the arguments have been published in a totally engrossing little book called, Rival Theories Of Cosmology.
Dr. Bonnor begins with a discussion of the relativistic theories of the universe, based on the general theory of relativity.
First of all, and this has been calculated by observation, the universe is expanding -- that is, the galaxies are receding from each other at immense speeds.
Because of this Dr. Bonnor holds that the universe is becoming more thinly populated by stars and whatever else is there.
This expansion has been going on for an estimated eight billion years.
Expands and contracts Dr. Bonnor supports the idea that the universe both expands and contracts, that in several billion years the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in.
Then, after many more billions of years, when all the galaxies are whistling toward a common center, this movement will slow down and reverse itself again.
Professor Bondi disagrees with the expansion-contraction theory.
He supports the steady-state theory which holds that matter is continually being created in space.
For this reason, he says, the density of the universe always remains the same even though the galaxies are zooming away in all directions.
New galaxies are forever being formed to fill in the gaps left by the receding galaxies.
If this is true, then the universe today looks just as it did millions of years ago and as it will look millions of years hence, even though the universe is expanding.
For new galaxies to be created, Professor Bondi declares, it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be created in an area the size of your living room once every few million years.
He contends this idea doesn't conflict with experiments on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy is based because some slight error must be assumed in such experiments.
Dr. Lyttleton backs the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory starts with the behavior of protons and electrons.
Protons and electrons bear opposite electrical charges which make them attract each other, and when they are joined they make up an atom of hydrogen -- the basic building block of matter.
The charges of the electron and proton are believed to be exactly equal and opposite, but Dr. Lyttleton is not so sure.
Suppose, says Dr. Lyttleton, the proton has a slightly greater charge than the electron ( so slight it is presently immeasurable ).
This would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess.
Now if one hydrogen atom were placed at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atoms, it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atoms in the sphere.
Because electrical forces ( the charge-excess ) are far more powerful than gravitation, the surface hydrogen atoms would shoot away from the sphere.
Dr. Lyttleton then imagines the universe as a large hydrogen sphere with surface atoms shooting away from it.
This, he claims, would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe.
Fleeting glimpse this slim book, while giving the reader only a fleeting glimpse of the scientific mind confronting the universe, has the appeal that informed conversation always has.
Several photographs and charts of galaxies help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion, and the smooth language indicates the contributors were determined to avoid the jargon that seems to work its way into almost every field.
It is clear from this discussion that cosmologists of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equipped with optical devices which will open up new vistas to science.
Presently, the intense absorption of ultra-violet rays in the earth's atmosphere seriously hinders ground observation.
These scientists are convinced that a telescope unclouded by the earth's gases will go a long way toward bolstering or destroying cosmic theories.
There would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nations is at the same time accelerating the study of the space around us, giving us a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien regions.
In doing away with the tea tray, the elephants and the giant tortoise, science has developed a series of rationally defensible explanations of the cosmos.
And although the universe may forever defy understanding, it might even now be finding its match in the imagination of man.
Roots, the new play at the brand-new Mayfair Theater on 46th St. which has been made over from a night club, is about the intellectual and spiritual awakening of an English farm girl.
Highly successful in England before its transfer to New York, most of Roots is as relentlessly dour as the trappings of the small new theater are gaudy.
Only in its final scene, where Beatie Bryant ( Mary Doyle ) shakes off the disappointment of being jilted by her intellectual lover and proclaims her emancipation do we get much which makes worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happenings we have had to watch for most of the first two and one-half acts.
The burden of Mr. Wesker's message is that people living close to the soil ( at least in England ) are not the happy, fine, strong, natural, earthy people city-bred intellectuals imagine.
Rather they are genuine clods, proud of their cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminating influences of aesthetics or thought.
They care no more for politics, says Mr. Wesker, than they do for a symphony.
Seeming to have roots in the soil, they actually have none in life.
They dwell, in short, in the doltish twilight in which peasants and serfs of the past are commonly reported to have lived.
But this is a theme which does not take so much time to state as Mr. Wesker dedicates to it.
So much untidiness of mind and household does not attract the interest of the theatergoer ( unless he has been living in a gilded palace, perhaps, and wants a real big heap of contrast ).
The messy meals, the washing of dishes, the drying of clothes may be realism, but there is such a thing as redundancy.
Now for the good points.
Miss Doyle as Beatie has a great fund of animal spirits, a strong voice and a warm smile.
She is just home from a sojourn in London where she has become the sweetheart of a young fellow named Ronnie ( we never do see him ) and has been subjected to a first course in thinking and appreciating, including a dose of good British socialism.
But while she is able to tell her retarded family about the new world she has seen open before her, Ronnie has not been able to observe her progress, and instead of appearing at a family party to be looked over like a new bull, he sends Beatie a letter of dismissal.
Beatie, getting no sympathy for her misfortune, soon rallies and finds that although she has lost a lover she has gained her freedom.
Despite a too long sustained declamatory flight, this final speech is convincing, and we see why British audiences apparently were impressed by Roots.
There were several fairly good minor portraits in the play, including William Hansen's impersonation of a stubborn, rather pathetic father, and Katherine Squire's vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brooked no hifalutin' nonsense from her daughter, or anyone else.
But I am afraid Mr. Wesker's meat and potatoes dish isn't well seasoned enough for local audiences.
Shakespeare had a word for everything, even for the rain that disrupted Wednesday night's Much Ado About Nothing opening the season of free theatre in Central Park.
The New York Shakespeare Festival, which is using the Wollman Memorial Skating Rink while its theatre near the Belvedere is being completed, began bravely.
Joseph Papp, impassioned founder of the festival and director of Much Ado, had a vibrant, colorful production under way.
Using a wide stage resourcefully he mingled music and dance with Shakespeare's words in a spirited mixture.
The audience filled all the seats inside the Wollman enclosure and overflowed onto the lawns outside the fence.
The barbed sallies of Beatrice and Benedick, so contemporary to a public inured to the humor of insult, raised chuckles.
The simple-minded comedy of Dogberry and Verges, also familiar in a day that responds easily to jokes skimmed off the top of writers' heads, evoked laughter.
The vivacity of the masquers' party at Leonato's palace, with the Spanish motif in the music and dancing in honor of the visiting Prince of Arragon, cast a spell of delight.
As Much Ado turned serious while the insipid Claudio rejected Hero at the altar, a sprinkle began to fall.
At first hardly a person in the audience moved, although some umbrellas were opened.
But the rain came more heavily, and men and women in light summer clothes began to depart.
The grieving Hero and her father, Leonato, followed by the Friar, left the stage.
A voice on the loudspeaker system announced that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minutes.
More than half the audience departed.
Some remained in the Wollman enclosure, fortified with raincoats or with newspapers to cover their heads.
Others huddled under the trees outside the fence.
Twenty minutes after the interruption, although it was still raining, the play was resumed at the point in the fourth act where it had been stopped.
Beatrice ( Nan Martin ) and Benedick ( J. D. Cannon ) took their places on the stage.
In their very first speeches it was clear that Shakespeare, like a Nostradamus, had foreseen this moment.
Said Benedick : Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
Replied Beatrice : yea, and I will weep a while longer.
The heavens refused to give up their weeping.
The gallant company completed Act 4 and got through part of Act 5.
But the final scenes could not be played.
If any among the hardy hundreds who sat in the downpour are in doubt about how it comes out, let them take comfort.
Much Ado ends happily.
The Parks Department has done an admirable job of preparing the Wollman Rink for Shakespeare.
One could hardly blame Newbold Morris, the Parks Commissioner, for devoting so much grateful mention to the department's technicians who at short notice provided the stage with its rising platforms, its balcony, its generous wings and even its impressive trapdoors for the use of the villains.
Eldon Elder, who designed the stage, also created a gay, spacious set that blended attractively with the park background and Shakespeare's lighthearted mood.
Mr. Papp has directed a performance that has verve and pace, although he has tolerated obvious business to garner easy laughs where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable.
Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints.
Still a demurrer or two must be entered.
Schwarzkopf is, of course, Schwarzkopf.
For style and assurance, for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her.
If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be, it is still a beautiful instrument, controlled and flexible.
Put to the service of lieder of Schubert, Brahms, Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way, it made its effect with ease and precision.
But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism.
Instead of her old confidence in the simplest, purest, most moving musical expression, Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra, some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside.
The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable.
Clever light songs were overly coy, tragic songs a little too melodramatic.
There was an extra pause here, a gasp or a sigh there, here and there an extra little twist of a word or note, all in the interest of effect.
The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness.
There were stunning musical phrases too, and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication.
Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist, John Wustman, often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition.
All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them.
The dance, dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8,500 of them ) had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier, when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs.
On Saturday, the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field, the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing, and the order of the program improved.
There was, additionally, a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons.
Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first New York performance of Mr. Ailey's Roots Of The Blues, a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival.
Otherwise, the program included, as on Thursday, the Taras-*tchaikovsky Design For Strings, the Dollar-*britten Divertimento, the Dollar-*de Banfield The Duel and the pas de deux from The Nutcracker.
Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn, who danced the Nutcracker pas de deux, were also seen in the Petipa-*minkus pas de deux from Don Quixote, another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely.
Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening, Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in The Duel, a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants.
Mr. Ailey's Roots Of The Blues, an earthy and very human modern dance work, provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening.
As Brother John Sellers sang five blues to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard, Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating, threatening, contemptuous and ecstatic.
Their props were two stepladders, a chair and a palm fan.
He wore the clothes of a laborer, and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress.
The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps, lifts, crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong, sometimes almost frightening, tensions.
Roots Of The Blues may not be for gentle souls, but others should welcome its super-charged impact.
Perhaps it is better to stay at home.
The armchair traveler preserves his illusions.
This somewhat cynical comment may be found in Blue Skies, Brown Studies, a collection of travel essays by William Sansom, who would never consider staying home for long.
Mr. Sansom is English, bearded, formidably cultivated, the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories, of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between.
The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning, his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell, Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an American multimillionaire ( his fourth ).
The result is rather wonderful, but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices.
There are sixteen essays in Blue Skies, Brown Studies.
Most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines.
All are well written and are overwritten.
But, even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow, he still can charm and astound.
Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another.
Mr. Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence, with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of English, with a thick shower of sophisticated, cultural references.
A contemplative connoisseur I like to sniff a place, and reproduce what it really smells and looks like, its color, its particular kind of life.
This is an exact description of what Mr. Sansom does.
He ignores guidebook facts.
He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions.
It is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for, an impression compounded of visual details, of a savory mixture of smells, of much loving attention to architecture and scenery, of lights and shadows, of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past.
William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London, Vienna, the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords.
But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions.
A writer lives, at best, in a state of astonishment, he says.
Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all.
To transmit that feeling he writes.
This may not be true of many writers, but it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom.
So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez ; at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands, always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City ; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants, La Bonne Auberge, which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport ; and at the infinite variety of London.
Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto.
He can coin a neat phrase : a street spattered with an invigoration of people ; tulips with petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears ; after a snowstorm a landscape smelling of woodsmoke and clarity.
And, for all his lacquered, almost Byzantine self-consciousness, he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison.
Beauty borrowed from afar in one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza.
How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus : the white colonnaded, cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South, the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza : the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch, the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen, his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep, his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips.
Nice, even if a trifle gaudy.
Blue Skies, Brown Studies is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs.
In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television, but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio.
W*b*a*i, the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band, has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void.
Yesterday it offered Poised For Violence, by Jean Reavey.
W*b*a*i is on the right track : in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre, as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate.
Unfortunately, Poised For Violence was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point.
Mrs. Reavey's work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-*broadway production in the fall -- and, in addition, employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged.
The play's device is to explore society's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting rather than just be themselves.
In a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe, performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty.
Somewhere in Mrs. Reavey's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit.
But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt.
Moreover, her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills.
But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words.
Which in itself is an immediate reward of the *j experiment ; good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration.
A weekly showcase for contemporary music, from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music, is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month.
Titled What's New In Music?
The enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station *j.
The brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points, and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze.
The show is programed and written by the station's assistant continuity editor, Chuck Briefer.
The first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings.
Last Saturday's interesting melange included Ernst Toch, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new space opera by the Swedish composer, Karl-*birger Blomdahl.
Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer, a particular type of music or the music of a given country.
It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene.
But one wishes, when the appetite is whetted, as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera, that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions.
The Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close.
It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season, but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's heart.
It is good to see those numbers again.
The Suite Of Old Russian Dances that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth ; the amusing Yurochka, in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance ; the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) Polyanka or The Meadow ; the three Moldavian dances entitled Zhok ; the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called Bul'ba ; and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called City Quadrille are all just as good as one remembers them to have been, and they are welcome back.
So, for that matter, are the newer dances -- the Kalmuk Dance with its animal movements, that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called The Platter, the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called Summer, The Three Shepherds of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs, and, of course, the trenchant Rock 'n' Roll.
As autumn starts its annual sweep, few Americans and Canadians realize how fortunate they are in having the world's finest fall coloring.
Spectacular displays of this sort are relatively rare in the entire land surface of the earth.
The only other regions so blessed are the British Isles, western Europe, eastern China, southern Chile and parts of Japan, New Zealand and Tasmania.
Their autumn tints are all fairly low keyed compared with the fiery stabs of crimson, gold, purple, bronze, blue and vermilion that flame up in North America.
Jack Frost is not really responsible for this great seasonal spectacle ; in fact, a freezing autumn dulls the blaze.
The best effects come from a combination of temperate climate and plenty of late-summer rain, followed by sunny days and cool nights.
Foliage pilgrimages, either organized or individual, are becoming an autumn item for more and more Americans each year.
Below is a specific guide, keyed to the calendar.
Nature Canada.
Late September finds Quebec's color at its peak, especially in the Laurentian hills and in the area south of the St. Lawrence River.
In the Maritime provinces farther east, the tones are a little quieter.
Ontario's foliage is most vivid from about Sept. 23 to Oct. 10, with both Muskoka ( 100 miles north of Toronto ) and Haliburton ( 125 miles northwest of Toronto ) holding color cavalcades starting Sept. 23.
In the Canadian Rockies, great groves of aspen are already glinting gold.
New England.
Vermont's sugar maples are scarlet from Sept. 25 to Oct. 15, and often hit a height in early October.
New Hampshire figures its peak around Columbus Day and boasts of all its hardwoods including the yellow of the birches.
The shades tend to be a little softer in the forests that blanket so much of Maine.
In western Massachusetts and northwest Connecticut, the Berkshires are at their vibrant prime the first week of October.
Middle Atlantic states.
The Adirondacks blaze brightest in early October, choice routes being 9*n from Saratoga up to Lake George and 73 and 86 in the Lake Placid area.
Farther south in New York there is a heavy haze of color over the Catskills in mid-*october, notably along routes 23 and 23*a.
About the same time the Alleghenies and Poconos in Pennsylvania are magnificent -- Renovo holds its annual Flaming Foliage Festival on Oct. 14, 15.
New Jersey's color varies from staccato to pastel all the way from the Delaware Water Gap to Cape May.
Southeast.
During the first half of October the Blue Ridge and other parts of the Appalachians provide a spectacle stretching from Maryland and West Virginia to Georgia.
The most brilliant displays are along the Skyline Drive above Virginia's Shenandoah Valley and throughout the Great Smokies between North Carolina and Tennessee.
Midwest.
Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have many superb stretches of color which reach their height from the last few days of September well into October, especially in their northern sections, e.g., Wisconsin's Vilas County whose Colorama celebration is Sept. 29-*oct. 8.
In Wisconsin, take route 55 north of Shawano or routes 78 and 60 from Portage to Prairie Du Chien.
In Michigan, there is fine color on route 27 up to the Mackinac Straits, while the views around Marquette and Iron Mountain in the Upper Peninsula are spectacular.
In Minnesota, Arrowhead County and route 53 north to International Falls are outstanding.
Farther south, there are attractive patches all the way to the Ozarks, with some seasonal peaks as late as early November.
Illinois' Shawnee National Forest, Missouri's Iron County and the maples of Hiawatha, Kan. should be at their best in mid-*october.
The West.
The Rockies have many Aspencades, which are organized tours of the aspen areas with frequent stops at vantage points for viewing the golden panoramas.
In Colorado, Ouray has its Fall Color Week Sept. 22-29, Rye and Salida both sponsor Aspencades Sept. 24, and Steamboat Springs has a week-long Aspencade Sept. 25-30.
New Mexico's biggest is at Ruidoso Oct. 7, 8, while Alamogordo and Cloudcroft cooperate in similar trips Oct. 1.
Americana pleasure domes.
Two sharply contrasting places designed for public enjoyment are now on display.
The Corn Palace at Mitchell, S. Dak., the world's corniest building, has a carnival through Sept. 23 headlining the Three Stooges and Pee Wee Hunt.
Since 1892 ears of red, yellow, purple and white corn have annually been nailed to 11 big picture panels to create huge paintings.
The 1961 theme is the Dakota Territorial Centennial, with the pictures including the Lewis and Clark expedition, the first river steamboat, the 1876 gold rush, a little red schoolhouse on the prairie, and today's construction of large Missouri River reservoirs.
The panels will stay up until they are replaced next summer.
Longwood Gardens, near Kennett Square, Pa. ( about 12 miles from Wilmington, Del. ), was developed and heavily endowed by the late Pierre S. Du Pont.
Every Wednesday night through Oct. 11 there will be an elaborate colored fountain display, with 229 nozzles throwing jets of water up to 130 feet.
The peacock tail nozzle throws a giant fan of water 100 feet wide and 40 feet high.
The gardens themselves are open free of charge the year round, and the 192 permanent employes make sure that not a dead or wilted flower is ever seen indoors or out by any visitor.
The greenhouses alone cover 3-1/2 acres.
Books clock without hands.
Carson Mc*cullers, after a long, painful illness that might have crushed a less-indomitable soul, has come back with an absolute gem of a novel which jumped high on best-seller lists even before official publication.
Though the subject -- segregation in her native South -- has been thoroughly worked, Miss Mc*cullers uses her poet's instinct and storyteller's skill to reaffirm her place at the very top of modern American writing.
Franny and Zooey.
With an art that almost conceals art, J. D. Salinger can create a fictional world so authentic that it hurts.
Here, in the most eagerly awaited novel of the season ( his first since The Catcher In The Rye, ) he tells of a college girl in flight from the life around her and the tart but sympathetic help she gets from her 25-year-old brother.
The Head Of Monsieur M., Althea Urn.
A deft, hilarious satire on very high French society involving a statesman with two enviable possessions, a lovely young bride and a head containing such weighty thoughts that he has occasionally to remove it for greater comfort.
There is probably a moral in all this about mind vs. heart.
A Matter Of Life And Death.
Virgilia Peterson, a critic by trade, has turned her critical eye pitilessly and honestly on herself in an autobiography more of the mind and heart than of specific events.
It is an engrossing commentary on a repressive, upper-middle-class New York way of life in the first part of this century.
Dark Rider.
This retelling by Louis Zara of the brief, anguished life of Stephen Crane -- poet and master novelist at 23, dead at 28 -- is in novelized form but does not abuse its tragic subject.
Rural Free, Rachel Peden.
Subtitled A Farmwife's Almanac Of Country Living, this is a gentle and nostalgic chronicle of the changing seasons seen through the clear, humorous eye of a Hoosier housewife and popular columnist.
Dance Russians, Filipinos.
Two noted troupes from overseas will get the fall dance season off to a sparkling start.
Leningrad's Kirov Ballet, famous for classic purity of technique, begins its first U.*s. tour in New York ( through Sept. 30 ).
The Bayanihan Philippine Dance Company, with music and dances that depict the many facets of Filipino culture, opens its 60-city U.*s. tour in San Francisco ( through Sept. 24 ) then, via one-night stands, moves on to Los Angeles ( Sept. 29 thru Oct. 1 ).
Festivals across the land.
With harvests in full swing, you can enjoy festivals for grapes at Sonoma, Calif. ( Sept. 22-24 ), as well as for cranberries at Bandon, Ore. ( Sept. 28 thru Oct. 1 ), for buckwheat at Kingwood, W. Va. ( Sept. 28-30 ), sugar cane at New Iberia, La. ( Sept. 29 thru Oct. 1 ) and tobacco at Richmond, Va. ( Sept. 23-30 ).
The mule is honored at Benson, N.*c. ( Sept. 22, 23 ) and at Boron, Calif. ( Sept. 24 thru Oct. 1 ), while the legend of the Maid of the Mist is celebrated at Niagara Falls through the 24th.
The fine old mansions of U.*s. Grant's old home town of Galena, Ill. are open for inspection ( Sept. 23, 24 ).
An archery tournament will be held at North Falmouth, Mass. ( Sept. 23, 24 ).
The 300th anniversaries of Staten Island ( through Sept. 23 ) and of Mamaroneck, N.*y. ( through Sept. 24 ) will both include parades and pageants.
Movies Purple Noon : this French film, set in Italy, is a summertime splurge in shock and terror all shot in lovely sunny scenery -- so breath-taking that at times you almost forget the horrors the movie is dealing with.
But slowly they take over as Alain Delon ( Life, Sept. 15 ), playing a sometimes appealing but always criminal boy, casually tells a rich and foot-loose American that he is going to murder him, then does it even while the American is trying to puzzle out how Delon expects to profit from the act.
Records Norma.
Callas devotees will have good reason to do their customary cart wheels over a new and complete stereo version of the Bellini opera.

Of the nation's eight million pleasure-boat owners a sizable number have learned that late autumn is one of the loveliest seasons to be afloat -- at least in that broad balmy region that lies below America's belt line.
Waterways are busy right now from the Virginia capes to the Texas coast.
There true yachtsmen often find November winds steadier, the waters cooler, the fish hungrier, and rivers more pleasant -- less turbulence and mud, and fewer floating logs.
More and more boats move overland on wheels ( 1.8 million trailers are now in use ) and Midwesterners taking long weekends can travel south with their craft.
In the Southwest, the fall brings out flotillas of boatsmen who find the summer too hot for comfort.
And on northern shores indomitable sailors from Long Island to Lake Michigan will beat around the buoys in dozens of frostbite races.
Some pleasant fall cruising country is mapped out below.
Boating west coast.
Pleasure boating is just scooting into its best months in California as crisp breezes bring out craft of every size on every kind of water -- ocean, lake and reservoir.
Shore facilities are enormous -- Los Angeles harbors 5,000 boats, and Long Beach 3,000 -- but marinas are crowded everywhere.
New docks and ramps are being rushed at Playa Del Rey, Ventura, Dana Point, Oceanside and Mission Bay.

Ten thousand twisty miles of shoreline frame the 30-odd lakes in the vast Tennessee River system that loops in and out of seven states.
When dam construction began in 1933, fewer than 600 boats used these waters ; today there are 48,500.
A year ago it was bruited that the primary character in Erich Maria Remarque's new novel was based on the Marquis Alfonso De Portago, the Spanish nobleman who died driving in the Mille Miglia automobile race of 1957.
If this was in fact Mr. Remarque's intention he has achieved a notable failure.
Clerfayt of Heaven Has No Favorites resembles Portago only in that he is male and a race-driver -- quite a bad race-driver, whereas Portago was a good one.
He is a dull, unformed, and aimless person ; the twelfth Marquis De Portago was intelligent, purposeful, and passionate.
One looked forward to Mr. Remarque's ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel has yet been written grounded on automobile racing, as dramatic a sport as mankind has devised.
Unhappily, Heaven Has No Favorites does not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list.
Mr. Remarque's conception of this novel was sound and perhaps even noble.
He proposed throwing together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balanced on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery.
His treatment of it is something else.
His heroine chooses to die -- the price of recovery, years under the strict regimen of a sanatorium, being higher than she wishes to pay.
Her lover precedes her in death, at the wheel, and presumably he too has chosen.
Between the first meeting of Clerfayt and Lillian and this dismal denouement, Mr. Remarque has laid down many pages of junior-philosophical discourse, some demure and rather fetching love-making, pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurants of Europe, and a modicum of automobile racing.
The ramblings on life, death, and the wonder of it all are distressing ; the love-making, perhaps because it is pale and low-key when one has been conditioned to expect harsh colors and explicitness, is often charming ; the automobile racing bears little relation to reality.
This latter failure is more than merely bad reportage and it is distinctly more important than it would have been had the author drawn Clerfayt as, say, a tournament golfer.
Hazards to life and limb on the golf course, while existent, are actuarially insignificant.
Race-drivers, on the other hand, are quite often killed on the circuit, and since it was obviously Mr. Remarque's intention to establish automobile racing as life in microcosm, one might reasonably have expected him to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of techniques but of mores and attitudes.
He does not.
The jacket biography describes him as a former racing driver, and he may indeed have been, although I do not recall having encountered his name either in the records or the literature.
Perhaps he has only forgotten a great deal.
The book carries a disclaimer in which Remarque says it has been necessary for him to take minor liberties with some of the procedures and formalities of racing.
The necessity is not clear to me, and, in any case, to present a case-hardened race-driver as saying he has left his car, which, or whom, he calls Giuseppe, parked on the Place Vendome sneering at a dozen Bentleys and Rolls-*royces parked around him is not a liberty ; it is an absurdity.
But it is in the matter of preoccupation with death, which is the primary concern of the book, that Remarque's failure is plainest.
Clerfayt is neurotic, preoccupied, and passive.
To be human, he believes, is to seek one's own destruction : the Freudian death-wish cliche inevitably cited whenever laymen talk about auto race-drivers.
In point of fact, the race-drivers one knows are nearly always intelligent, healthy technicians who differ from other technicians only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live.
A Clerfayt may moon on about the face of Death in the cockpit ; a Portago could say, as he did say to me, if I die tomorrow, still I have had twenty-eight wonderful years ; but I shan't die tomorrow ; I'll live to be 105.
Clerfayt, transported, may think of the engine driving his car as a mystical beast under the hood.
The Italian master Piero Taruffi, no less sensitive, knows twice the ecstasy though he thinks of a car's adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 miles an hour as a matter best expressed in algebraic formulae.
Clerfayt, driving, sees himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell ; the Briton Stirling Moss, one of the greatest virtuosi of all time, believes that ultra-fast road-circuit driving is an art form related to ballet.
Errors in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the German may not convey quite everything Mr. Remarque hoped to tell us.
However, my principal objection in this sort of novel is to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers, pilots, submariners, atomic researchers, and all the machine-masters of our age as brooding mystics or hysterical fatalists.
The west is leaderless, according to this book.
In contrast, the East is ably led by such stalwart heroes as Khrushchev, Tito, and Mao.
Against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stands a group of nations unable to agree on fundamentals and each refusing to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all.
It is Field Marshal Montgomery's belief that in most Western countries about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or Christianity ; about 30 per cent call themselves Christians in order to keep up appearances and be considered respectable, and only the last 10 per cent are genuine Christians and believers in democracy.
But these Western countries do care about themselves.
Each feels intensely national.
If, say, the Russians intended to stop Tom Jones' going to the pub, then Tom Jones would fight the Commies.
But he would fight for his own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connected with it -- such as cause.
For all practical purposes, the West stands disunited, undedicated, and unprepared for the tasks of world leadership.
With this barrage, Montgomery of Alamein launches his attack upon the blunderings of the West.
Never given to mincing words, he places heavy blame upon the faulty, uncourageous leadership of Britain and particularly America.
At war's end leadership in Western Europe passed from Britain because the Labour Government devoted its attention to the creation of a welfare state.
With Britain looking inward, overseas problems were neglected and the baton was passed on to the United States.
Montgomery believes that she started well.
America gave generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike.
She pushed wartorn and poverty-stricken nations into prosperity, but she failed to lead them into unity and world peace.
America has divided more than she has united the West.
The reasons are that America generally believes that she can buy anything with dollars, and that she compulsively strives to be liked.
However, she really does not know how to match the quantity of dollars given away by a quality of leadership that is basically needed.
But the greater reason for fumbling, stumbling American leadership is due to the shock her pride suffered when the Japanese attacked at Pearl Harbor.
They are determined, Montgomery writes, not to be surprised again, and now insist on a state of readiness for war which is not only unnecessary, but also creates nervousness among other nations in the Western Alliance -- not to mention such great suspicions among the nations of the Eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament is not possible.
The net result is that under American leadership the general world situation has become bad.
To Monty, the American people, who in two previous world wars were very reluctant to join the fight, now look like the nation most likely to lead us all into a third World War.
As faulty as has been our leadership clearly the United States must be relied upon to lead.
The path to leadership is made clear.
Montgomery calls for a leader who will first put the West's own house in order.
Such a man must be able and willing to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group, a person in whom all the member nations will have absolute confidence.
This leader must be a man who lives above illusions that heretofore have shaped the foreign policy of the United States, namely that Russia will agree to a reunited Germany, that the East German government does not exist, that events in Japan in June 1960 were Communist-inspired, that the true government of China is in Formosa, that Mao was the evil influence behind Khrushchev at the Summit Conference in Paris in May 1960, and that either China or Russia wants or expects war.
Such a leader must strengthen *j politically, and establish that true unity about which it has always talked.
After drastically overhauling *j, Western leadership should turn to reducing the suspicions that tear apart the East and West.
Major to this effort is to get all world powers to withdraw to their own territories, say by 1970.
The West should make the central proposal ; but the East would have to show sincerity in carrying it out.
But where is the leader who will handle all these things for us?
Montgomery knew all the national leaders up to the time of Kennedy.
The man whom he would select as our leader for this great task is De Gaulle.
He alone has the wisdom, the conviction, the tenacity, and the courage to reach a decision.
But De Gaulle is buried in the cause of restoring France's lost soul.
Whoever rises to the occasion walks a treacherous path to leadership.
The leader Montgomery envisages will need to discipline himself, lead a carefully regulated and orderly life, allow time for quiet thought and reflection, adapt decisions and plans to changing situations, be ruthless, particularly with inefficiency, and be honest and morally proper.
All in all, Montgomery calls for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the events that surround him.
In looking as far back as Moses, thence to Cromwell, Napoleon, Lincoln, Churchill, and Nehru, Montgomery attempts to trace the stirrings and qualities of great men.
He believes that greatness is a marriage between the man and the times as was aptly represented by Churchill, who would very possibly have gone down in history as a political failure if it had not been for Hitler's war.
However, Montgomery makes little contribution to leadership theory and practice.
Most of what is said about his great men of history has already been said, and what has not is largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene.
Like Eisenhower, he holds the militarist's suspicion of politicians.
However, at the same time Montgomery selects as his hero De Gaulle, who is a militarist dominated by political ambitions.
Monty shows a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for giving adequate support.
For the most part, his writing rambles and jogs, preventing easy access by the reader to his true thoughts.
Nevertheless, Montgomery has stated courageously and wisely the crisis of the Western world.
It suffers from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership.
And it remains to be seen if the new frontier now taking form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of events.
It is no common thing for a listener ( critical or otherwise ) to hear a singer live for the first time only after he has died.
But then, Mario Lanza was no common singer, and his whole career, public and non-public, was studded with the kind of unconventional happenings that terminate with the appearance of his first recital only when he has ceased to be a living voice.
It is a kind of justice, too, that it should originate in London's Royal Albert Hall, where, traditionally, the loudest, if not the greatest, performers have entertained the thousands it will accommodate ( R*c*a Victor *j 2454, $4.98 ).
To be sure, Lanza made numerous concert tours, here and abroad, but these did not take him to New York where the carping critic might lurk.
The reading public, the theatergoing public, the skindiving public, the horse-playing public -- all these and others fill substantial roles in U.*s. life, but none is so varied, vast and vigilant as the eating public.
The Department of Agriculture averaged out U.*s. food consumption last year at 1,488 lbs. per person, which, allowing for the 17 million Americans that John Kennedy said go to bed hungry every night, means that certain gluttons on the upper end must somehow down 8 lbs. or more a day.
That mother hen of the weight-height tables, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., clucks that 48 million Americans are overweight.
Through previous centuries, eating changed by nearly imperceptible degrees, and mostly toward just getting enough.
Now big forces buffet food.
For the first time in history, the U.*s. has produced a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the Government's most embarrassing problem is how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million tons of surplus farm produce.
In this same society, the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth his income buy more calories than he can consume.
Refrigeration, automated processing and packaging conspire to defy season and banish spoilage.
And in the wake of the new affluence and the new techniques of processing comes a new American interest in how what people eat affects their health.
To eat is human, the nation is learning to think, to survive divine.
Fads, facts not all the concern for health is well directed.
From the fusty panaceas of spinach, eggs and prunes, the U.*s. has progressed to curds, concentrates and capsules.
Each year, reports the American Medical Association, ten million Americans spend $900 million on vitamins, tonics and other food supplements.
At juice bars in Los Angeles' 35 health stores, a new sensation is a pink, high-protein cocktail, concocted of dried eggs, powdered milk and cherry-flavored No-*cal, which sells for 59-cents per 8-oz. glass.
Grocery stores sell dozens of foods that boast of having almost no food value at all.
But a big part of the public wants to know facts about diet and health, and a big group of U.*s. scientists wants to supply them.
The man most firmly at grips with the problem is the University of Minnesota's Physiologist Ancel Keys, 57, inventor of the wartime *j ( for Keys ) ration and author of last year's bestselling Eat Well And Stay Well.
From his birch-paneled office in the Laboratory of Physiological Hygiene, under the university's football stadium in Minneapolis ( we get a rumble on every touchdown ), blocky, grey-haired Dr. Keys directs an ambitious, $200,000-a-year experiment on diet, which spans three continents and seven nations and is still growing.
Pursuing it, he has logged 500,000 miles, suffered indescribable digestive indignities, and meticulously collected physiological data on the health and eating habits of 10,000 individuals, from Bantu tribesmen to Italian contadini.
He has measured the skinfolds ( the fleshy areas under the shoulder blades ) of Neapolitan firemen, studied the metabolism of Finnish woodcutters, analyzed the mealie-meal eaten by Capetown coloreds, and experimented on Minneapolis businessmen.
And fats.
Keys's findings, though far from complete, are likely to smash many an eating cliche.
Vitamins, eggs and milk begin to look like foods to hold down on ( though mothers' milk is still the ticket ).
Readings of the number of milligrams of cholesterol in the blood, which seem to have value in predicting heart attacks, are becoming as routine as the electrocardiogram, which can show that the heart has suffered a symptomatic attack.
Already many an American knows his count, and rejoices or worries depending on whether it is nearer 180 ( safe ) or 250 ( dangerous ).
Out of cholesterol come Keys's main messages so far : Americans eat too much.
The typical U.*s. daily menu, says Dr. Keys, contains 3,000 calories, should contain 2,300.
And extra weight increases the risk of cancer, diabetes, artery disease and heart attack.
Americans eat too much fat.
With meat, milk, butter and ice cream, the calorie-heavy U.*s. diet is 40% fat, and most of that is saturated fat -- the insidious kind, says Dr. Keys, that increases blood cholesterol, damages arteries, and leads to coronary disease.
Obesity : a malnutrition.
Throughout much of the world, food is still so scarce that half of the earth's population has trouble getting the 1,600 calories a day necessary to sustain life.
The deficiency diseases -- scurvy, tropical sprue, pellagra -- run rampant.
In West Africa, for example, where meat is a luxury and babies must be weaned early to make room at the breast for later arrivals, a childhood menace is kwashiorkor, or Red Johnny, a growth-stunting protein deficiency ( signs : reddish hair, bloated belly ) that kills more than half its victims, leaves the rest prey for parasites and lingering tropical disease.
In the well-fed U.*s., deficiency diseases have virtually vanished in the past 20 years.
Today, as Harrison's Principles Of Internal Medicine, a standard internist's text, puts it, the most common form of malnutrition is caloric excess or obesity.
Puritan New England regarded obesity as a flagrant symbol of intemperance, and thus a sin.
Says Keys : maybe if the idea got around again that obesity is immoral, the fat man would start to think.
Morals aside, the fat man has plenty to worry about -- over and above the fact that no one any longer loves him.
The simple mechanical strain of overweight, says New York's Dr. Norman Jolliffe, can overburden and damage the heart for much the same reason that a Chevrolet engine in a Cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it were in a body for which it was built.
The fat man has trouble buying life insurance or has to pay higher premiums.
He has -- for unclear reasons -- a 25% higher death rate from cancer.
He is particularly vulnerable to diabetes.
He may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable, because excess body fat hampers his breathing and restricts his muscular movement.
Physiologically, people overeat because what Dr. Jolliffe calls the appestat is set too high.
The appestat, which adjusts the appetite to keep weight constant, is located, says Jolliffe, in the hypothalamus -- near the body's temperature, sleep and water-balance controls.
Physical exercise raises the appestat.
So does cold weather.
In moderate doses, alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhances appetite ( the original reason for the cocktail ) ; but because liquor has a high caloric value -- 100 calories per oz. -- the heavy drinker is seldom hungry.
In rare cases, diseases such as encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently, destroying nearly all sense of satiety.
Food for frustration.
Far more frequently, overeating is the result of a psychological compulsion.
It may be fostered by frustration, depression, insecurity -- or, in children, simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother's nagging.
Some families place undue emphasis on food : conversations center on it, and rich delicacies are offered as rewards, withheld as punishment.
The result says Jolliffe : the child gains the feeling that food is the purpose of life.
Food may act as a sedative, giving temporary emotional solace, just as, for some people, alcohol does.
Reports Dr. Keys : a fairly common experience for us is the wife who finds her husband staying out more and more.
He may be interested in another woman, or just like being with the boys.
So she fishes around in the cupboard and hauls out a chocolate cake.
It's a matter of boredom, and the subconscious feeling that she is entitled to something, because she's being deprived of something else.
For the army of compulsive eaters -- from the nibblers and the gobblers to the downright gluttons -- reducing is a war with the will that is rarely won.
Physiologist Keys flatly dismisses such appetite depressants as the amphetamines ( Benzedrine, Dexedrine ) as dangerous crutches for a weak will.
Keys has no such objections to Metrecal, Quaker Oats's Quota and other 900-calorie milk formulas that are currently winning favor from dieters.
Metrecal is a pretty complete food, he says.
It contains large amounts of protein, vitamins and minerals.
In the quantity of 900 calories a day, anyone will lose weight on it -- 20, 30 or 40 lbs..
But Keys worries that the Metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eating smaller portions of food.
That remarkable cholesterol.
Despite his personal distaste for obesity ( disgusting ), Dr. Keys has only an incidental interest in how much Americans eat.
What concerns him much more is the relationship of diet to the nation's No. 1 killer : coronary artery disease, which accounts for more than half of all heart fatalities and kills 500,000 Americans a year -- twice the toll from all varieties of cancer, five times the deaths from automobile accidents.
Cholesterol, the cornerstone of Dr. Keys's theory, is a mysterious yellowish, waxy substance, chemically a crystalline alcohol.
Scientists assume that cholesterol ( from the Greek chole, meaning bile, and sterios, meaning solid ) is somehow necessary for the formation of brain cells, since it accounts for about 2% of the brain's total solid weight.
They know it is the chief ingredient in gallstones.
They suspect it plays a role in the production of adrenal hormones, and they believe it is essential to the transport of fats throughout the circulatory system.
But they cannot fully explain the process of its manufacture by the human liver.
Although the fatty protein molecules, carried in the blood and partly composed of cholesterol, are water soluble, cholesterol itself is insoluble, and cannot be destroyed by the body.
A remarkable substance, says Dr. Keys, quite apart from its tendency to be deposited in the walls of arteries.
When thus deposited, Keys says that cholesterol is mainly responsible for the arterial blockages that culminate in heart attacks.
Explains Keys : as the fatty protein molecules travel in the bloodstream, they are deposited in the intima, or inner wall of a coronary artery.
The proteins and fats are burned off, and the cholesterol is left behind.
As cholesterol piles up, it narrows, irritates and damages the artery, encouraging formation of calcium deposits and slowing circulation.
Eventually, says Keys, one of two things happens.
A clot forms at the site, seals off the flow of blood to the heart and provokes a heart attack.
Or ( more commonly, thinks Keys ) the deposits themselves get so big that they choke off the artery's flow to the point that an infarct occurs : the heart muscle is suffocated, cells supplied by the artery die, and the heart is permanently, perhaps fatally injured.
Fats & coronaries.
Ordinarily, the human liver synthesizes only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body's needs -- for transportation of fats and for production of bile.
Even eggs and other cholesterol-rich foods, eaten in normal amounts, says Dr. Keys, do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood.
But fatty foods do.
During World War 2, doctors in The Netherlands and Scandinavia noted a curious fact : despite the stresses of Nazi occupation, the death rate from coronary artery disease was slowly dropping.
Not until long after the war -- 1950, in fact -- did they get a hint of the reason.
That year, Sweden's Haqvin Malmros showed that the sinking death rate neatly coincided with increasingly severe restrictions on fatty foods.
That same year the University of California's Dr. Laurance Kinsell, timing oxidation rates of blood fats, stumbled onto the discovery that many vegetable fats cause blood cholesterol levels to drop radically, while animal fats cause them to rise.
Here Keys and others, such as Dr. A. E. Ahrens of the Rockefeller Institute, took over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fats -- and even between different varieties of each.
All natural food fats fall into one of three categories -- saturated, mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated.
The degree of saturation depends on the number of hydrogen atoms on the fat molecule.
Saturated fats can accommodate no more hydrogens.
Mono-unsaturated fats have room for two more hydrogens on each molecule, and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule has room for at least four hydrogens.
The three fats have similar caloric values ( about 265 calories per oz. ), but each exerts a radically different influence on blood cholesterol.
As a result, although we still make use of this distinction, there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed.
Just what is meant by spirit and by matter?
The terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all.
Yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do.
For in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreed-upon elements of experience.
We are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected.
When the words are used, we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind, or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours.
One of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit.
Just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities.
Not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true.
Demons, fairies, angels, and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars.
In such a world the words matter and spirit both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all.
In it important elements of Christianity and of the Biblical view of reality in general, which now cause us much difficulty, could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously.
The progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of Biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it.
In carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit.
The objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support.
Science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time.
When, therefore, it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit, these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality.
In doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions, removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear, and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions.
There have been, indeed, many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful.
All this has not, however, been an unmixed blessing.
The scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough.
The house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means, or at best with wholly inadequate means, for dealing with his experience of spirit.
Although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective, the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever.
We simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience.
There is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality, as we know and apprehend it, with respect to which we can refer this experience.
Science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives.
The situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in Arthur Miller's play The Crucible, which deals with the Salem witch trials.
As the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of Salem in Puritan America at the end of the eighteenth century.
Aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene, it is a quite normal community.
The conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures, foibles, irritations, and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age.
There is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people.
Instead, the audience can sit back at ease and, from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things, enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion.
A teenage girl, Abigail Williams, is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle, the Reverend Samuel Parris, about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings.
For all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night, the demon world is populated with real creatures, and witches actually can be seen flying through the air.
As the play unfolds, however, the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community.
Everyone in Salem, saint and sinner alike, is swept up by it.
It is like a mysterious epidemic which, starting first with Abigail and Parris, spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it.
It grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery, moral disintegration, and destruction.
The audience leaves the play under a spell, it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes.
If one asks about this play, what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power, there is no better answer to give than spirit.
This is not to attempt to say what spirit is, but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience.
In the end the good man, John Proctor, expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says, a fire, a fire is burning ] I hear the boot of Lucifer, I see his filthy face ] the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them.
We marvel at their blindness for not seeing this.
Yet are not we of the mid-twentieth century, who rightly do not believe there is any such thing as the devil, just as bad off as they -- only in a different way?
In our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play.
We are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false.
Even Mr. Miller himself seems uncertain on this score.
In a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play, he says at one point : however, that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of Lucifer's many-faced lieutenants.
And his belief is not to his discredit.
Better minds than Hale's were -- and still are -- convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken.
( page 33 ) on the other hand, a little later on he says : since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out God's beard and the Devil's horns, but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes.
The concept of unity, in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force, in which good and evil are relative, ever-changing, and always joined to the same phenomenon -- such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas.
When we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's worthlessness -- until redeemed -- the necessity of the Devil may become evident as a weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or church-state.
( page 34 ) apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real.
Yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over Salem.
It casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power.
It is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect.
For this does not account for the integral, elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds, nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell.
The reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary.
Spirit and community there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit.
Apart from spirit there could be no community, for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity, cohesiveness, and permanence.
Think, for example, of the spirit of the Marine Corps.
Surely this is a reality we all acknowledge.
We cannot, of course, assign it any substance.
It is not material and is not a thing occupying space and time.
Yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known.
So it is too with many other spirits which we all know : the spirit of Nazism or Communism, school spirit, the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team, the spirit of Rotary or the Ku Klux Klan.
Every community, if it is alive has a spirit, and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity.
In searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit, the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful.
For it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit.
It is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere.
It is the spirit which is the source of a community's drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers.
Yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community.
The idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas.
One characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness.
The members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them.
It is for them a given which they and they alone possess.
The spirit of the Marine Corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it.
It is they, of course, who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the Corps for future recruits to find as they come into it.
If the content of faith is to be presented today in a form that can be understanded of the people -- and this, it must not be forgotten, is one of the goals of the perennial theological task -- there is no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation.
This does not mean that mythological language as such can no longer be used in theology and preaching.
The absurd notion that demythologization entails the expurgation of all mythological concepts completely misrepresents Bultmann's intention.
His point is not that mythology may not be used, but that it may no longer be regarded as the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for expressing the Christian kerygma.
When we say that a mythological mode of thought must be completely abandoned, we mean it must be abandoned as the sole or proper means for presenting the Christian understanding of existence.
Mythological concepts may by all means still be used, but they can be used responsibly only as symbols or ciphers, that is, only if they are also constantly interpreted in nonmythological ( or existential ) terms.
The statement is often made that when Bultmann argues in this way, he overestimates the intellectual stumbling-block which myth is supposed to put in the way of accepting the Christian faith.
But this statement is completely unconvincing.
If Bultmann's own definition of myth is strictly adhered to ( and it is interesting that this is almost never done by those who make such pronouncements ), the evidence is overwhelming that he does not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concepts of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant.
Nor is it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban centers of our culture that are admittedly almost entirely secularized and so profoundly estranged from the conventional forms in which the gospel has been communicated.
On the contrary, even in the heart of the Bible belt itself, as can be attested by any one who is called to work there, the industrial and technological revolutions have long been under way, together with the corresponding changes in man's picture of himself and his world.
In fact, it is in just such a situation that the profundity of Bultmann's argument is disclosed.
Although the theological forms of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularized situation, the striking thing is the rapidity with which they are being reduced to a marginal existence.
This is especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class.
Time and again in counseling and teaching, one encounters members of this group whose attempts to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythologies of their fundamentalist heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world are only too painfully obvious.
The same thing is also evidenced by the extreme culture-*protestantism so often observed to characterize the preaching and teaching of the American churches.
In the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be expressed, the unavoidable need to demythologize it makes use of whatever resources are at hand -- and this usually means one or another of the various forms of folk religion current in the situation.
This is not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with Norman Vincent Peale's cult of reassurance or the other types of a purely cultural Christianity is the ever-present need for a demythologized gospel.
But it is to say that this need is far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundits seem to have suspected.
However, even if the latent demand for demythologization is not nearly as widespread as we are claiming, at least among the cultured elements of the population there tends to be an almost complete indifference to the church and its traditional message of sin and grace.
To be sure, when this is pointed out, a common response among certain churchmen is to fulminate about the little flock and the great crowd and to take solace from Paul's castigation of the wisdom of the wise in the opening chapter of First Corinthians.
But can we any longer afford the luxury of such smug indigation?
Can the church risk assuming that the folly of men is as dear to God as their wisdom, or, as is also commonly implied, that the foolishness of God and the foolishness of men are simply two ways of talking about the same thing?
Can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gifts we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation our mission in the world must become increasingly precarious?
There is an ancient and venerable tradition in the church ( which derives, however, from the heritage of the Greeks rather than from the Bible ) that God is completely independent of his creation and so has no need of men for accomplishing his work in the world.
By analogy, the church also has been regarded as entirely independent of the world in the sense of requiring nothing from it in order to be the church.
But, as Scripture everywhere reminds us, God does have need of his creatures, and the church, a fortiori, can ill afford to do without the talents with which the world, by God's providence, presents it.
And yet this is exactly the risk we run when we assume, as we too often do, that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that makes it seem incredible and irrelevant to cultured men.
Until we translate this gospel into a language that enlightened men today can understand, we are depriving ourselves of the very resources on which the continued success of our witness most certainly depends.
In arguing in this way, we are obviously taking for granted that a demythologized restatement of the kerygma can be achieved ; and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reasons to justify such a conviction.
But the main point here is that even if such a restatement were not possible, the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable.
This is what we mean when we say this demand must be accepted without condition.
If to be a Christian means to say yes where I otherwise say no, or where I do not have the right to say anything at all, then my only choice is to refuse to be a Christian.
Expressed differently : if the price for becoming a faithful follower of Jesus Christ is some form of self-destruction, whether of the body or of the mind -- sacrificium corporis, sacrificium intellectus -- then there is no alternative but that the price remain unpaid.
This must be stressed because it is absolutely essential to the argument of this concluding chapter.
Modern man, as Dietrich Bonhoeffer has told us, has come of age ; and though this process by no means represents an unambiguous gain and is, in fact, marked by the estrangement from the depths that seems to be the cost of human maturation, it is still a positive step forward ; and those of us who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it.
In any event, it is an irreversible step, and if we are at all honest with ourselves, we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which God has seen fit to place us.
To say this, of course, is to take up a position on one side of a controversy going on now for some two hundred years, or, at any rate, since the beginning of the distinctively modern period in theological thought.
We have aligned ourselves with that liberal tradition in Protestant Christianity that counts among the great names in its history those of Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Herrmann, Harnack, and Troeltsch, and more recently, Schweitzer and the early Barth and, in part at least, Bultmann.
It is to this same tradition that most of the creative figures in the last century and a half of American theology also belong.
For we must number here not only the names of Bushnell, Clarke, and Rauschenbusch, not to mention those of the Chicago School and Macintosh, but those of the brothers Niebuhr and ( if America may claim him ] ) Tillich as well.
Finally, we may also mention the several members of the self-consciously neoliberal movement that developed at the University of Chicago and is heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of Alfred North Whitehead.
What makes this long and diverse tradition essentially one is that those who have belonged to it have been profoundly in earnest about being modern men in a distinctively modern world.
Although they have also been concerned to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church, they have exhibited no willingness whatever to sacrifice their modernity to their Christianity.
They have insisted, rather, on living fully and completely within modern culture and, so far from considering this treason to God, have looked upon it as the only way they could be faithful to him.
When we say, then, that today, in our situation, the demand for demythologization must be accepted without condition, we are simply saying that at least this much of the liberal tradition is an enduring achievement.
However much we may have to criticize liberal theology's constructive formulations, the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism, not behind it.
In affirming this we have already taken the decisive step in breaking the deadlock into which Bultmann's attempt to formulate such a theology has led.
For we have said, in effect, that of the two alternatives to his position variously represented by the other participants in the demythologizing discussion, only one is really an alternative.
If the demand for demythologization is unavoidable and so must be accepted by theology unconditionally, the position of the right is clearly untenable.
Whereas Bultmann's center position is structurally inconsistent and is therefore indefensible on formal grounds alone, the general position of the right, as represented, say, by Karl Barth, involves the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so is invalidated on the material grounds we have just considered.
It follows, then, provided the possibilities have been exhausted, that the only real alternative is the general viewpoint of the left, which has been represented on the Continent by Fritz Buri and, to some extent at least, is found in much that is significant in American and English theology.
In order to make the implications of our position as clear as possible, we may develop this argument at greater length.
We may show, first, that there cannot possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represented by Bultmann, Barth, and Buri.
To do this, it is sufficient to point out that if the principle in terms of which alternatives are to be conceived is such as to exclude more than two, then the question of a third possibility is a meaningless question.
Thus, if what is at issue is whether all *j is *j, it is indifferent whether some *j is not *j or no *j is *j, since in either case the judgment in question is false.
Hence, if what is in question is whether in a given theology myth is or is not completely rejected, it is unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity is accepted ; for, in either event, the first possibility is excluded.
Therefore, the only conceivable alternatives are those represented, on the one hand, by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive positions of Buri and Barth and, on the other hand, by the third but really pseudo position ( analogous to a round square ) of Bultmann.
A second point requires more extended comment.
It will be recalled from the discussion in Section 7 that the position of the right, as represented by Barth, rests on the following thesis : the only tenable alternative to Bultmann's position is a theology that ( 1 ) rejects or at least qualifies his unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation ; ( 2 ) accepts instead a special biblical hermeneutics or method of interpretation ; and ( 3 ) in so doing, frees itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event Jesus Christ by means of statements that, from Bultmann's point of view, are mythological.
One hundred years ago there existed in England the Association for the Promotion of the Unity of Christendom.
Representing as it did the efforts of only unauthorized individuals of the Roman and Anglican Churches, and urging a communion of prayer unacceptable to Rome, this association produced little fruit, and, in fact, was condemned by the Holy Office in 1864.
Now again in 1961, in England, there is perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discussed as Christian unity.
The Church Unity Octave, January 18-25, was enthusiastically devoted to prayer and discussion by the various churches.
Many people seem hopeful, yet it is difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of Christian unity in 1961 than there was in 1861.
But it must be readily seen that the religious picture in England has so greatly changed during these hundred years as to engender hope, at least on the Catholic side.
For the tide is well on the turn, as the London Catholic weekly Universe has written.
I came to England last summer to do research on the unpublished letters of Cardinal Newman.
As an American Catholic of Irish ancestry, I came with certain preconceptions and expectations ; being intellectually influenced by Newman and the general 19th-century literature of England, I knew only a Protestant-dominated country.
Since arriving here, however, I have formed a far different religious picture of present-day England.
In representing part of this new picture, I will be recounting some of my own personal experiences, reactions and judgments ; but my primary aim is to transcribe what Englishmen themselves are saying and writing and implying about the Roman and Anglican Churches and about the present religious state of England.
Since the Protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit, my Roman collar and black garb usually identify me in England as a Roman Catholic cleric.
In any case, I have always been treated with the utmost courtesy by Englishmen, even in Devonshire and Cornwall, where anti-*catholic feeling has supposedly existed the strongest and longest.
Nowhere have I seen public expression of anti-*catholicism.
On my first Guy Fawkes Day here, I found Catholics as well as non-*catholics celebrating with the traditional fireworks and bonfires, and was told that most Englishmen either do not know or are not concerned with the historical significance of the day.
A Birmingham newspaper printed in a column for children an article entitled The True Story of Guy Fawkes, which began : when you pile your guy on the bonfire tomorrow night, I wonder how much of the true story of Guy Fawkes you will remember?
In the 355 years since the first Guy Fawkes Night, much of the story has been forgotten, so here is a reminder.
The article proceeded to give an inaccurate account of a Catholic plot to kill King James 1.
In spite of the increase in numbers and prestige brought about by the conversions of Newman and other Tractarians of the 1840's and 1850's, the Catholic segment of England one hundred years ago was a very small one ( four per cent, or 800,000 ) which did not enjoy a gracious hearing from the general public.
The return of the Catholic hierarchy in 1850 was looked upon with indignant disapprobation and, in fact, was charged with being a gesture of disloyalty.
In 1864 Newman professedly had to write his Apologia with his keenest feelings in order to be believed and to command a fair hearing from English readers.
Now, in 1961, the Catholic population of England is still quite small ( ten per cent, or 5 million ) ; yet it represents a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population.
A Protestant woman marveled to me over the large crowds going in and out of the Birmingham Oratory ( Catholic ) Church on Sunday mornings.
She found this a marvel because, as she said, only six per cent of English people are churchgoers.
She may not have been exact on this number, but others here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten.
From many sides come remarks that Protestant churches are badly attended and the large medieval cathedrals look all but empty during services.
A Catholic priest recently recounted how in the chapel of a large city university, following Anglican evensong, at which there was a congregation of twelve, he celebrated Mass before more than a hundred.
The Protestant themselves are the first to admit the great falling off in effective membership in their churches.
According to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the Church of England, the total of confirmed members is 9,748,000, but only 2,887,671 are registered on the parochial church rolls, and over 27 million people in England are baptized into the Church of England, but roughly only a tenth of them continue.
An amazing article in the Manchester Guardian of last November, entitled Fate Of Redundant Churches, states than an Archbishops' Commission reported last month that in the Church of England alone there are 790 churches which are redundant now, or will be in 20 years' time.
A further 260 Anglican churches have been demolished since 1948.
And in the last five years, the Methodist chapel committee has authorized the demolition or, more often, the sale of 764 chapels.
Most of these former churches are now used as warehouses, but neither Anglicans nor Nonconformists object to selling churches to Roman Catholics, and have done so.
While it must be said that these same Protestants have built some new churches during this period, and that religious population shifts have emptied churches, a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy is that fewer Protestants are going to church.
It should be admitted, too, that there is a good percentage of lapsed or nonchurchgoing Catholics ( one paper writes 50 per cent ).
Still, it is clear from such reports, and apparently clear from the remarks of many people, that Protestants are decreasing and Catholics increasing.
An Anglican clergyman in Oxford sadly but frankly acknowledged to me that this is true.
A century ago, Newman saw that liberalism ( what we now might call secularism ) would gradually but definitely make its mark on English Protestantism, and that even high Anglicanism would someday no longer be a serviceable breakwater against doctrinal errors more fundamental than its own.
That day is perhaps today, 1961, and it seems no longer very meaningful to call England a Protestant country.
One of the ironies of the present crusade for Christian unity is that there are not, relatively speaking, many real Christians to unite.
Many English Catholics are proud of their Catholicism and know that they are in a new ascendancy.
The London Universe devoted its centenary issue last December 8 to mapping out various aspects of Catholic progress during the last one hundred years.
With traditional nationalistic spirit, some Englishmen claim that English Catholicism is Catholicism at its best.
I have found myself saying with other foreigners here that English Catholics are good Catholics.
It has been my experience to find as many men as women in church, and to hear almost everyone in church congregations reciting the Latin prayers and responses at Mass.
They hope, of course, to reclaim the non-*catholic population to the Catholic faith, and at every Sunday Benediction they recite by heart the Prayer for England : o Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and our most gentle queen and mother, look down in mercy upon England, thy dowry, and upon us all who greatly hope and trust in thee.
Intercede for our separated brethren, that with us in the one true fold they may be united to the chief Shepherd, the vicar of thy Son.
A hymn often to be heard in Catholic churches is Faith Of Our Fathers, which glories in England's ancient faith that endured persecution, and which proclaims : faith of our Fathers : Mary's prayers shall win our country back to thee.
The English saints are widely venerated, quite naturally, and now there is great hope that the Forty Martyrs and Cardinal Newman will soon be canonized.
Because they have kept the faith of their medieval fathers, English Catholics have always strongly resented the charge of being un-*english.
I have not seen this charge made during my stay here, but apparently it is still in the air.
For example, a writer in a recent number of the Queen hyperbolically states that of the myriad imprecations the only one which the English Catholics really resent is the suggestion that they are un-*english.
In this connection, it has been observed that the increasing number of Irish Catholics, priests and laity, in England, while certainly seen as good for Catholicism, is nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic English Catholics, especially when these Irishmen offer to remind their Christian brethren of this good.
One of the more noteworthy changes that have taken place since the mid-19th century is the situation of Catholics at Oxford and Cambridge Universities.
At Oxford one hundred years ago there were very few Catholics, partly because religious tests were removed only in 1854.
Moreover, for those few there was almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for their religious needs.
Now, not only are there considerably more laity as students and professors at Oxford, but there are also numerous houses of religious orders existing in respectable and friendly relations with the non-*catholic members of the University.
Some Catholic priests lecture there ; Catholic seminarians attend tutorials and row on the Cherwell with non-*catholic students.
Further evidence that Roman Catholicism enjoys a more favorable position today than in 1861 is the respectful attention given to it in the mass media of England.
The general tone of articles appearing in such important newspapers as the Manchester Guardian and the Sunday Observer implies a kindly recognition that the Catholic Church is now at least of equal stature in England with the Protestant churches.
On successive Sundays during October, 1960, Paul Ferris ( a non-*catholic ) wrote articles in the Observer depicting clergymen of the Church of England, the Church of Rome and the Nonconformist Church.
The Catholic priest, though somewhat superficially drawn, easily came out the best.
There were many letters of strong protest against the portrait of the Anglican clergyman, who was indeed portrayed as a man not particularly concerned with religious matters and without really very much to do as clergyman.
Such a series of articles was certainly never printed in the public press of mid-*victorian England.
There was so much interest shown in this present-day venture that it was continued on B.*b.*c., where comments were equally made by an Anglican parson, a Free Church minister and a Catholic priest.
Catholic priests have frequently appeared on television programs, sometimes discussing the Christian faith on an equal footing with Protestant clergymen.
A notable example of this was the discussion of Christian unity by the Catholic Archbishop of Liverpool, Dr. Heenan, and the Anglican Archbishop of York, Dr. Ramsey, recently appointed Archbishop of Canterbury.
The good feeling which exists between these two important church figures is now well known in England.
The Holy Sacrifice of the Mass with commentary has been televised several times in recent months.
And it was interesting to observe that B.*b.*c.'s television film on Christmas Eve was The Bells Of St. Mary's.
Of course, the crowning event that has dramatically upset the traditional pattern of English religious history was the friendly visit paid by Dr. Fisher, then Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, to the Vatican last December.
It was the first time an English Primate has done this since the 14th century.
English Catholics reacted to this event with moderate but real hope.
Almost daily something is reported which feeds this Catholic hope in England : statistics of the increasing numbers of converts and Irish Catholic immigrants ; news of a Protestant minister in Leamington who has offered to allow a Catholic priest to preach from his pulpit ; a report that a Catholic nun had been requested to teach in a non-*catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of its masters ; the startling statement in a respectable periodical that Catholics, if the present system is still in operation, will constitute almost one-third of the House of Lords in the next generation ; a report that 200 Protestant clergymen and laity attended a votive Mass offered for Christian unity at a Catholic church in Slough during the Church Unity Octave.
The death of a man is unique, and yet it is universal.
The straight line would symbolize its uniqueness, the circle its universality.
But how can one figure symbolize both?
Christianity declares that in the life and death of Jesus Christ the unique and the universal concur.
Perhaps no church father saw this concurrence of the unique and the universal as clearly, or formulated it as precisely, as Irenaeus.
To be the Savior and the Lord, Jesus Christ has to be a historical individual with a biography all his own ; he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoops to earth for a while but never identifies itself with man's history.
Yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind.
His history is his alone, yet each man must recognize his own history in it.
His death is his alone, yet each man can see his own death in the crucifixion of Jesus.
Each man can identify himself with the history and the death of Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ has identified himself with human history and human death, coming as the head of a new humanity.
Not a circle, then, nor a straight line, but a spiral represents the shape of death as Irenaeus sees it ; for a spiral has motion as well as recurrence.
As represented by a spiral, history may, in some sense, be said to repeat itself ; yet each historical event remains unique.
Christ is both unique and universal.
The first turn of the spiral is the primeval history of humanity in Adam.
As Origen interprets the end of history on the basis of its beginning, so Irenaeus portrays the story of Adam on the basis of the story of Christ.
Whence, then, comes the substance of the first man?
From God's Will and Wisdom, and from virgin earth.
For God had not rained, says the Scripture, before man was made, and there was no man to till the earth.
From this earth, then, while it was still virgin God took dust and fashioned the man, the beginning of humanity.
Irenaeus does not regard Adam and Eve merely as private individuals, but as universal human beings, who were and are all of humanity.
Adam and Eve were perfect, not in the sense that they possessed perfection, but in the sense that they were capable of development toward perfection.
They were, in fact, children.
Irenaeus does not claim pre-existence for the human soul ; therefore there is no need for him, as there is for Origen, to identify existence itself with the fall.
Existence is created and willed by God and is not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history.
Historical existence is a created good.
The biblical symbol for this affirmation is expressed in the words : so God created man in his own image ; in the similitude of God he created him.
There are some passages in the writings of Irenaeus where the image of God and the similitude are sharply distinguished, so most notably in the statement : if the ( Holy ) Spirit is absent from the soul, such a man is indeed of an animal nature ; and, being left carnal, he will be an imperfect being, possessing the image ( of God ) in his formation, but not receiving the similitude ( of God ) through the Spirit.
Thus the image of God is that which makes a man a man and not an oyster ; the similitude of God, by contrast, is that which makes a man a child of God and not merely a rational creature.
Recent research on Irenaeus, however, makes it evident that he does not consistently maintain this distinction.
He does not mean to say that Adam lost the similitude of God and his immortality through the fall ; for he was created not exactly immortal, nor yet exactly mortal, but capable of immortality as well as of mortality.
Therefore Irenaeus describes man's creation as follows : so that the man should not have thoughts of grandeur, and become lifted up, as if he had no lord, because of the dominion that had been given to him, and the freedom, fall into sin against God his Creator, overstepping his bounds, and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards God, a law was given him by God, that he might know that he had for lord the lord of all.
And He laid down for him certain conditions : so that, if he kept the command of God, then he would always remain as he was, that is, immortal ; but if he did not, he would become mortal, melting into earth, whence his frame had been taken.
These conditions man did not keep, and thus he became mortal ; yet he did not stop being human as a result.
There is no justification for systematizing the random statements of Irenaeus about the image of God beyond this, nor for reading into his imprecise usage the later theological distinction between the image of God ( humanity ) and the similitude of God ( immortality ).
Man was created with the capacity for immortality, but the devil's promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost Adam his immortality.
He was, in the words of Irenaeus, beguiled by another under the pretext of immortality.
The true way to immortality lay through obedience, but man did not believe this.
Eve was disobedient ; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin.
And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin, having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race ; so also did Mary, having a man betrothed ( to her ), and being nevertheless a virgin, by yielding obedience, become the cause of salvation, both to herself and the whole human race.
Because he interprets the primitive state of man as one of mere potentiality or capacity and believes that Adam and Eve were created as children, Irenaeus often seems inclined to extenuate their disobedience as being due, no doubt, to carelessness, but still wicked.
His interpretation of the beginning on the basis of the end prompts him to draw these parallels between the Virgin Eve and the Virgin Mary.
That parallelism affects his picture of man's disobedience too ; for as it was Christ, the Word of God, who came to rescue man, so it was disobedience to the word of God in the beginning that brought death into the world, and all our woe.
With this act of disobedience, and not with the inception of his individual existence, man began the downward circuit on the spiral of history, descending from the created capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality.
At the nadir of that circuit is death.
Along with the fruit they did also fall under the power of death, because they did eat in disobedience ; and disobedience to God entails death.
Wherefore, as they became forfeit to death, from that ( moment ) they were handed over to it.
This leads Irenaeus to the somewhat startling notion that Adam and Eve died on the same day that they disobeyed, namely, on a Friday, as a parallel to the death of Christ on Good Friday ; he sees a parallel also to the Jewish day of preparation for the Sabbath.
In any case, though they had been promised immortality if they ate of the tree, they obtained mortality instead.
The wages of sin is death.
Man's life, originally shaped for immortality and for communion with God, must now be conformed to the shape of death.
Nevertheless, even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belongs to God, and he still rules.
Even death, therefore, has a providential as well as a punitive function.
Wherefore also He ( God ) drove him ( man ) out of Paradise, and removed him far from the tree of life, not because He envied him the tree of life, as some venture to assert, but because He pitied him, ( and did not desire ) that he should continue a sinner for ever, nor that the sin which surrounded him should be immortal, and evil interminable and irremediable.
But He set a bound to his ( state of ) sin, by interposing death, and thus causing sin to cease, putting an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh, which should take place in the earth, so that man, ceasing at length to live in sin, and dying to it, might live to God.
This idea, which occurs in both Tatian and Cyprian, fits especially well into the scheme of Irenaeus' theology ; for it prepares the way for the passage from life through death to life that is achieved in Christ.
As man can live only by dying, so it was only by his dying that Christ could bring many to life.
It is probably fair to say that the idea of death is more profound in Irenaeus than the idea of sin is.
This applies to his picture of Adam.
It is borne out also by the absence of any developed theory about how sin passes from one generation to the next.
It becomes most evident in his description of Christ as the second Adam, who does indeed come to destroy sin, but whose work culminates in the achievement of immortality.
This emphasis upon death rather than sin as man's fundamental problem Irenaeus shares with many early theologians, especially the Greek-speaking ones.
They speak of the work of Christ as the bestowal of incorruptibility, which can mean ( though it does not have to mean ) deliverance from time and history.
Death reminds man of his sin, but it reminds him also of his transience.
It represents a punishment that he knows he deserves, but it also symbolizes most dramatically that he lives his life within the process of time.
These two aspects of death cannot be successfully separated, but they dare not be confused or identified.
The repeated efforts in Christian history to describe death as altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspects of death cannot be separated.
Such efforts almost always find themselves compelled to ask whether Adam was created capable of growing old and then older and then still older, in short, whether Adam's life was intended to be part of the process of time.
If it was, then it must have been God's intention to translate him at a certain point from time to eternity.
One night, so some of these theories run, Adam would have fallen asleep, much as he fell asleep for the creation of Eve ; and thus he would have been carried over into the life eternal.
The embarrassment of these theories over the naturalness of death is an illustration of the thesis that death cannot be only a punishment, for some termination seems necessary in a life that is lived within the natural order of time and change.
On the other hand, Christian faith knows that death is more than the natural termination of temporal existence.
It is the wages of sin, and its sting is the law.
If this aspect of death as punishment is not distinguished from the idea of death as natural termination, the conclusion seems inevitable that temporal existence itself is a form of punishment rather than the state into which man is put by the will of the Creator.
This seems to have been the conclusion to which Origen was forced.
If death receives more than its share of attention from the theologian and if sin receives less than its share, the gift of the life eternal through Christ begins to look like the divinely appointed means of rescue from temporal, i.e., created, existence.
Such an interpretation of death radically alters the Christian view of creation ; for it teaches salvation from, not salvation in, time and history.
Because Christianity teaches not only salvation in history, but salvation by the history of Christ, such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the Christian understanding of the work of Christ.
Furthermore, as an encouragement to revisionist thinking, it manifestly is fair to admit that any fraternity has a constitutional right to refuse to accept persons it dislikes.
The Unitarian clergy were an exclusive club of cultivated gentlemen -- as the term was then understood in the Back Bay -- and Parker was definitely not a gentleman, either in theology or in manners.
Ezra Stiles Gannett, an honorable representative of the sanhedrin, addressed himself frankly to the issue in 1845, insisting that Parker should not be persecuted or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain him by force could exist.
Even so, Gannett judiciously argued, the Association could legitimately decide that Parker should not be encouraged nor assisted in diffusing his opinions by those who differ from him in regard to their correctness.
We today are not entitled to excoriate honest men who believed Parker to be downright pernicious and who barred their pulpits against his demand to poison the minds of their congregations.
One can even argue -- though this is a delicate matter -- that every justification existed for their returning the Public Lecture to the First Church, and so to suppress it, rather than let Parker use it as a sounding board for his propaganda when his turn should come to occupy it.
Finally, it did seem clear as day to these clergymen, as Gannett's son explained in the biography of his father, they had always contended for the propriety of their claim to the title of Christians.
Their demand against the Calvinist Orthodoxy for intellectual liberty had never meant that they would follow free inquiry to the extreme of proclaiming Christianity a natural religion.
Grant all this -- still, when modern Unitarianism and the Harvard Divinity School recall with humorous affection the insults Parker lavished upon them, or else argue that after all Parker received the treatment he invited, they betray an uneasy conscience.
Whenever New England liberalism is reminded of the dramatic confrontation of Parker and the fraternity on January 23, 1843 -- while it may defend the privilege of Chandler Robbins to demand that Parker leave the Association, while it may plead that Dr. N. L. Frothingham had every warrant for stating, the difference between Trinitarians and Unitarians is a difference in Christianity ; the difference between Mr. Parker and the Association is a difference between no Christianity and Christianity -- despite these supposed conclusive assurances, the modern liberal heaves repeatedly a sigh of relief, of positive thanksgiving, that the Association never quite brought itself officially to expel Parker.
Had it done so, the blot on its escutcheon would have remained indelible, nor could the Harvard Divinity School assemble today to honor Parker's insurgence other than by getting down on its collective knees and crying peccavi.
Happily for posterity, then, the Boston Association did not actually command Parker to leave the room, though it came too close for comfort to what would have been an unforgivable brutality.
Fortunately, the honor of the denomination can attest that Cyrus Bartol defended Parker's sincerity, as did also Gannett and Chandler Robbins ; whereupon Parker broke down into convulsions of weeping and rushed out of the room, though not out of the Fellowship.
In the hall, after adjournment, Dr. Frothingham took him warmly by the hand and requested Parker to visit him -- whereupon our burly Theodore again burst into tears.
All this near tragedy, which to us borders on comedy, enables us to tell the story over and over again, always warming ourselves with a glow of complacency.
It was indeed a near thing, but somehow the inherent decency of New England ( which we inherit ) did triumph.
Parker was never excommunicated.
To the extent that he was ostracized or even reviled, we solace ourselves by saying he asked for it.
Yet, even after all these stratagems, the conscience of Christian liberality is still not laid to rest, any more than is the conscience of Harvard University for having done the abject penance for its rejection of Ralph Waldo Emerson's The Divinity School Address of naming its hall of philosophy after him.
In both cases the stubborn fact remains : liberalism gave birth to two brilliant apostates, both legitimate offspring of its loins, and when brought to the test, it behaved shabbily.
Suppose they both had ventured into realms which their colleagues thought infidel : is this the way gentlemen settle frank differences of opinion?
Is it after all possible that no matter how the liberals trumpet their confidence in human dignity they are exposed to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative has ever to worry about?
However, there is a crucial difference between the two histories.
Emerson evaded the problem by shoving it aside, or rather by leaving it behind him : he walked out of the Unitarian communion, so that it could lick the wound of his departure, preserve its self-respect and eventually accord him pious veneration.
Parker insisted upon not resigning, even when the majority wanted him to depart, upon daring the Fellowship to throw him out.
Hence he was in his lifetime, as is the memory of him afterwards, a canker within the liberal sensitivity.
He still points an accusing finger at all of us, telling us we have neither the courage to support him nor the energy to cut his throat.
Actually, the dispute between Parker and the society of his time, both ecclesiastical and social, was a real one, a bitter one.
It cannot be smoothed over by now cherishing his sarcasms as delightful bits of self-deprecation or by solemnly calling for a reconsideration of the justice of the objections to him.
The fact is incontestable : that liberal world of Unitarian Boston was narrow-minded, intellectually sterile, smug, afraid of the logical consequences of its own mild ventures into iconoclasm, and quite prepared to resort to hysterical repressions when its brittle foundations were threatened.
Parker, along with Garrison and Charles Sumner, showed a magnificent moral bravery when facing mobs mobilized in defense of the Mexican War and slavery.
Nevertheless, we can find reasons for respecting even the bigotry of the populace ; their passions were genuine, and the division between them and the abolitionists is clear-cut.
But Parker as the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which had proclaimed itself the repository of liberality poses a different problem, which is not to be resolved by holding him up as the champion of freedom.
Even though his theological theses have become, to us, commonplaces, the fundamental interrogation he phrased is very much with us.
It has been endlessly rephrased, but I may here put it thus : at what point do the tolerant find themselves obliged to become intolerant?
And then, as they become aware that they have reached the end of their patience, what do they, to their dismay, learn for the first time about themselves?
There can be no doubt, the Boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforcing its canons of behavior.
The gentle Channing, revered by all Bostonians, orthodox or Unitarian, wrote to a friend in Louisville that among its many virtues Boston did not abound in a tolerant spirit, that the yoke of opinion crushed individuality of judgment and action : no city in the world is governed so little by a police, and so much by mutual inspections and what is called public sentiment.
We stand more in awe of one another than most people.
Opinion is less individual or runs more into masses, and often rules with a rod of iron.
Even more poignantly, and with the insight of a genius, Channing added -- remember, this is Channing, not Parker ] -- that should a minister in Boston trust himself to his heart, should he speak without book, and consequently break some law of speech, or be hurried into some daring hyperbole, he should find little mercy.
Channing wrote this -- in a letter ] I think it fair to say that he never quite reached such candor in his sermons.
But Theodore Parker, commencing his mission to the world-at-large, disguised as the minister of a twenty-eighth Congregational Church which bore no resemblance to the Congregational polities descended from the founders ( among which were still the Unitarian churches ), made explicit from the beginning that the conflict between him and the Hunkerish society was not something which could be evaporated into a genteel difference about clerical decorum.
Because he spoke openly with what Channing had prophesied someone might -- with daring hyperbole -- Parker vindicated Channing's further prophecy that he who committed this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberals were disposed to allow to libertarians who appeared to them libertines.
An institutionalized liberalism proved itself fundamentally an institution, and only within those defined limits a license.
By reminding ourselves of these factors in the situation, we should, I am sure, come to a fresh realization, however painful it be, that the battle between Parker and his neighbors was fought in earnest.
He arraigned the citizens in language of so little courtesy that they had to respond with, at the least, resentment.
What otherwise could the lawyer, doctor, minister, the men of science and letters do when told that they had become the cherubim and seraphim and the three archangels who stood before the golden throne of the merchant, and continually cried, holy, holy, holy is the Almighty Dollar?
Nor, when we recollect how sensitive were the emotions of the old Puritan stock in regard to the recent tides of immigration, should we be astonished that their thin lips were compressed into a white line of rage as Parker snarled at them thus : talk about the Catholics voting as the bishop tells ] reproach the Catholics for it ] you and I do the same thing.
There are a great many bishops who have never had a cross on their bosom, nor a mitre on their head, who appeal not to the authority of the Pope at Rome, but to the Almighty Dollar, a pope much nearer home.
Boston has been controlled by a few capitalists, lawyers and other managers, who told the editors what to say and the preachers what to think.
This was war.
Parker meant business.
And he took repeated care to let his colleagues know that he intended them : even the Unitarian churches have caught the malaria, and are worse than those who deceived them -- which implied that they were very bad indeed.
It was duty he said that his parents had given him as a rule -- beyond even the love that suffused his being and the sense of humor with which he was largely supplied -- and it was duty he would perform, though it cost him acute pain and exhausted him by the age of fifty.
Parker could weep -- and he wept astonishingly often and on the slightest provocation -- but the psychology of those tears was entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre his opponents.
If it gave me pleasure to say hard things, he wrote, I would shut up forever.
We have to tell ourselves that when Parker spoke in this vein, he believed what he said, because he could continue, but the truth, which cost me bitter tears to say, I must speak, though it cost other tears hotter than fire.
Because he copiously shed his own tears, and yielded himself up as a living sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of New England, he was not disturbed by the havoc he worked in other people's consciences.
Our endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous was the fight is muffled by our indifference to the very issue which in the Boston of 1848 seemed to be the central hope of its Christian survival, that of the literal, factual historicity of the miracles as reported in the Four Gospels.
It is idle to ask why we are no longer disturbed if somebody, professing the deepest piety, decides anew that it is of no importance whether or not Christ transformed the water into wine at eleven A.*m. on the third of August, A.*d. 32.
We have no answer as to why we are not alarmed.
So we are the more prepared to give Parker the credit for having taken the right side in an unnecessary controversy, to salute his courage, and to pass on, happily forgetting both him and the entire episode.
We have not the leisure, or the patience, or the skill, to comprehend what was working in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the Harvard Divinity School who would muster the audacity to contradict his most formidable instructor, the majesterial Andrews Norton, by saying that, while he believed Jesus like other religious teachers, worked miracles, I see not how a miracle proves a doctrine.
I have, within the past fifty years, come out of all uncertainty into a faith which is a dominating conviction of the Truth and about which I have not a shadow of doubt.
It has been my lot all through life to associate with eminent scientists and at times to discuss with them the deepest and most vital of all questions, the nature of the hope of a life beyond this.
I have also constantly engaged in scientific work and am fully aware of the value of opinions formed in science as well as in the religions in the world.
In an amateurish, yet in a very real sense, I have followed the developments of archaeology, geology, astronomy, herpetology, and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advances being made in these fields.
At one time I became disturbed in the faith in which I had grown up by the apparent inroads being made upon both Old and New Testaments by a Higher Criticism of the Bible, to refute which I felt the need of a better knowledge of Hebrew and of archaeology, for it seemed to me that to pull out some of the props of our faith was to weaken the entire structure.
Doubts thus inculcated left me floundering for a while and, like some higher critical friends, trying to continue to use the Bible as the Word of God while at the same time holding it to have been subjected to a vast number of redactions and interpolations : attempting to bridge the chasm between an older, reverent, Bible-loving generation and a critical, doubting, Bible-emancipated race.
Although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the Book, I stood outside shivering in the cold.
In one thing the higher critics, like the modernists, however, overreached themselves, in claiming that the Gospel of John was not written in John's time but well after the first century, perhaps as late as 150 A.*d..
Now, if any part of the Bible is assuredly the very Word of God speaking through His servant, it is John's Gospel.
To ask me to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book was written long after all the events by some admiring follower, and was not inspired directly by the Spirit of God, is asking me to accept a miracle far greater than any of those recorded in the Bible.
Here I took my leave of my learned friends to step out on another path, to which we might give the modern name of Pragmatism, or the thing that works.
Test it, try it, and if it works, accept it as a guiding principle.
So, I put my Bible to the practical test of noting what it says about itself, and then tested it to see how it worked.
As a short, possibly not the best method, I looked up Word in the Concordance and noted that the Bible claims from Genesis 1 to Revelation 22 to be God's personal message to man.
The next traditional step then was to accept it as the authoritative textbook of the Christian faith just as one would accept a treatise on any earthly science, and I submitted to its conditions according to Christ's invitation and promise that, if any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself ( John 7 : 17 ).
The outcome of such an experiment has been in due time the acceptance of the Bible as the Word of God inspired in a sense utterly different from any merely human book, and with it the acceptance of our Lord Jesus Christ as the only begotten Son of God, Son of Man by the Virgin Mary, the Saviour of the world.
I believe, therefore, that we are without exception sinners, by nature alienated from God, and that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, came to earth, the representative Head of a new race, to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world, and that he who thus receives Christ as his personal Saviour is born again spiritually, with new privileges, appetites, and affections, destined to live and grow in His likeness forever.
Nor can any man save himself by good works or by a commendable moral life, although such works are the natural fruits and evidences of a saving faith already received and naturally expressing itself through such avenues.
I now ever look for Christ according to His promises and those of the Old Testament as well, to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth.
To state fully what the Bible means as my daily spiritual food is as intimate and difficult as to formulate the reasons for loving my nearest and dearest relatives and friends.
The Bible is as obviously and truly food for the spirit as bread is food for the body.
Again, as faith reveals God my Father and Christ my Saviour, I follow without question where He leads me daily by His Spirit of love, wisdom, power and prayer.
I place His precepts and His leadings above every seeming probability, dismissing cherished convictions and holding the wisdom of man as folly when opposed to Him.
I discern no limits to a faith vested in God and Christ, who is the sum of all wisdom and knowledge, and daring to trust Him even though called to stand alone before the world.
Our Lord's invitation with its implied promise to all is, come and see.
I stood at the bedside of my patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain.
As I ministered to his needs, I noticed that his face was radiant in spite of his suffering and I learned that he was trusting not only in the skill of his doctor and nurse but also the Lord.
In his heart he had that peace of which the Lord spoke when He said, peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you : not as the world giveth, give I unto you.
Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
What a joy to realize that we, too, can claim this promise tendered by the Lord during His earthly ministry to a group of men who were very dear to Him.
He was about to leave them, to depart from this world, and return to His Father in Heaven.
Before He left them He promised that His peace would be their portion to abide in their hearts and minds.
I praise God for the privilege of being a nurse who has that peace through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.
It makes my work a great deal easier to be able to pray for the Lord's guidance while ministering to the physical needs of my patients.
How often have I looked to Jesus when entering the sick room, asking for His presence and help in my professional duties as I give my talents not only as the world giveth but as one who loves the Saviour and His creatures.
Looking unto God, the Prophet Isaiah wrote these blessed words almost three thousand years ago : thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee : because he trusteth in thee.
Are you longing for peace in your heart?
Such a calm and assuring peace can be yours.
As only a member of the family can share in the innermost joys of the family, likewise one must belong to the family of God in order to receive the benefits that are promised to those who are His own.
Perhaps you are not His child.
Perhaps you do not know if you belong to Him.
You may know that you are in God's family and be just as sure of it as you are that you belong to the family of your earthly father.
God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life, and as many as received him, to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on His name.
It is to those who believe on His name and belong to Him that He gives His peace ; not that empty peace the world offers, but a deep, abiding peace which nothing can destroy.
Why not open your heart to the Lord Jesus Christ now, accept Him as your Saviour and let Him fill you with peace that only He can give.
Then, with the hymn writer of old, you can say : I am resting today in His wonderful peace, resting sweetly in Jesus' control.
I am kept from all danger by night and by day, and His glory is flooding my soul.
Satellites, sputniks, rockets, balloons ; what next?
Our necks are stiff from gazing at the wonders of outer space, which have captured the imagination of the American public.
Cape Canaveral's achievements thunder forth from the radio, television, and newspaper.
While we are filling outer space with scientific successes, for many the inner space of their soul is an aching void.
Proof?
An average of 50 suicides are reported in America each day ] one out of every three or four marriages ends in divorce ] over $200,000,000 is paid yearly to the 80,000 full-time fortune-tellers in the United States by fearful mankind who want to know what the future holds ] delinquency, juvenile and adult, is at an all-time high ] further proof?
Read your daily newspaper ] unfortunately, in our rush to beat the Russians, we have forgotten these truth-packed words of Jesus Christ : what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world ( that includes outer space ), and lose his own soul?
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
( Mark 36, 37 ).
Gaining outer space and losing inner space is bad business according to God's standards.
It is true that we must keep up our national defenses and scientific accomplishments ; only a fool would think otherwise.
But we must not forget man's soul.
Is putting a rocket in orbit half so significant as the good news that God put His Son, Jesus Christ, on earth to live and die to save our hell-bound souls?
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life ( John 3 : 16 ).
Never forget that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
Your spiritual inner space helps determine the spirituality of America as a nation.
We trust you are not one of the 70,000,000 Americans who do not attend church, but who feel that various forms of recreation are more important than worshipping the God who made our country great.
Is forgiveness of past sins, assurance of present help, and hope of future bliss in your orbit?
Or are you trying the devil's substitutes to relieve that spiritual hunger you feel within?
Pleasure, fame and fortune, drowning your troubles with a drink, and living it up with the gang are like candy bars when you're hungry : they may ease your hunger temporarily, but they'll never take the place of a satisfying, mouth-watering steak.
So it is spiritually.
No amount of religious ceremonies or even joining a church will relieve the gnawing of your inner space.
Why?
Because your soul was made to be filled with God Himself, not religious functions about Him.
Only He can satisfy the deepest longings.
That is why the Bible commands you to taste and see that the Lord is good : blessed ( happy ) is the man that trusteth in Him ( Psalm 34 : 8 ).
You can receive God into your heart and life by a step of personal faith.
Accept the sinless Son of God, Jesus Christ, as your own personal Saviour.
As many as received Him ( Jesus ), to them gave He power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.
The Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid?
( Psalm 27 : 1 ) a certain teacher scheduled a Fear Party for her fourth grade pupils.
It was a session at which all the youngsters were told to express their fears, to get them out in the open where they could talk about them freely.
The teacher thought it was so successful that she asks : wouldn't it be helpful to all age groups if they could participate in a similar confessional of their fears and worries?
Dr. George W. Crane, a medical columnist, thinks it would.
He says : that would reduce neurotic ailments tremendously.
Each week an estimated 20 million patients call upon us doctors.
Of this number, 50%, or 10 million patients have no diagnosable physical ailments whatever.
They are worry warts.
Yet they keep running from one physician to another, largely to get a willing ear who will listen to their parade of troubles.
One of the most wholesome things you could schedule in your church would thus be a group confessional where people could admit of their inner tensions.
We are evidently trying hard to think of new ways to deal with the problem of fear these days.
It must be getting more serious.
People are giving their doctors a hard time.
One doctor made a careful survey of his patients and the reasons for their troubles, and he reported that 40% of them worried about things that never happened ; 30% of them worried about past happenings which were completely beyond their control ; 12% of them worried about their health, although their ailments were imaginary ; 10% of them worried about their friends, neighbors, and relatives, most of whom were quite capable of taking care of themselves.
Only 8% of the worries had behind them real causes which demanded attention.
Well, most of our fears may be unfounded, but after you discover that fact, you have something else to worry about : why then do we have these fears?
What is the real cause of them?
What is there about us that makes us so anxious?
Look at the things we do to escape our fears and to forget our worries.
We spend millions of dollars every year on fortune tellers and soothsayers.
We spend billions of dollars at the race tracks, and more billions on other forms of gambling.
We spend billions of dollars on liquor, and many more billions on various forms of escapist entertainment.
We consume tons of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleeping pills in order to get a moment's relief from the tensions that are tearing us apart.
A visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea was taken to one of our amusement parks, and after he had seen it all, he said to a friend : you must be a very sad people.
Sad was not the right word, of course.
He should have said jittery, for that's what we are.
And that's worse than sad.
Watch people flock to amusement houses, cocktail lounges, and night clubs that advertise continuous entertainment, which means an endless flow of noise and frivolity by paid entertainers who are supposed to perform in those incredible ways which are designed to give men a few hours of dubious relaxation -- watch them and you can tell that many of them are running away from something.
In one of his writings Pascal speaks of this mania for diversion as being a sign of misery and fear which man cannot endure without such opiates.
Yes, and as tension mounts in this world, fear is increasing.
Does that explain why there is now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business?
We have so many new things to fear in this age of nuclear weapons, dreadful things which are too horrible to contemplate.
I doubt that fear parties and group confessionals will help very much.
Suppose we do get our fears out in the open, what then?
Isn't that where most of them are already -- right out on the front page of our newspapers?
Maybe we are talking about them too much.
The question is : what are we going to do about them?
Meanwhile, the enemy will capitalize on our fears, if he can.
Hitler did just that 23 years ago, building up tensions that first led to a Munich and then to a world war.
The fear of war can make us either too weak to stand and too willing to compromise, or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace as long as there is any chance to negotiate.
It is said that fear in human beings produces an odor that provokes animals to attack.
It could have the same effect on Communists.
The President of the United States has said : we will never negotiate out of fear, and we will never fear to negotiate.
That is a sound position, but it is important that Moscow shall recognize it not merely as the word of a president but as the mind of a free people who are not afraid.
And that's another reason why it is imperative for us these days to conquer our fears, to develop the poise that promotes peace.
Turning to the Word of God, we find the only sure way to do that.
In Psalm 27 : 1 you read those beautiful words which you must have in your heart if you are to master the fears that surround you, or to drive them out if they have you in their grip : the Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid?
Well, you say, those are beautiful words all right, but it was easy for the psalmist to sing them in his day.
He didn't live in a world of perpetual peril like ours.
He didn't know anything about the problems we face today.
No?
Read the next two verses : when the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear : though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
That is almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today, isn't it?
Our enemy is also threatening to devour us.
He has already devoured huge areas of the world, putting men behind concrete walls and iron curtains and barbed wire, reducing them to slavery, systematically crushing not only their bodies but their souls, and shooting them to death if they try to escape their prison.
Yes indeed, we too can see a warlike host of infidels encamped against us.
What a terrible thing, that wailing wall in Berlin ] a man with a baby in his arms stood there pleading for his wife who is on the other side with the rest of the family.
Another man tried to swim across the river from the East to the West, but was shot and killed.
A middle aged woman opened a window on the third floor of her house which was behind the wall, she threw out a few belongings and then jumped ; she was fatally injured.
The entrance to a church has been walled up, so that the congregation, most of which is in the western sector, cannot worship God there anymore.
Practically everybody in Berlin has relatives and friends that live in the opposite part of the city.
People stand at the wall giving vent to their feelings, weeping, pounding it with their fists, pleading for loved ones.
But the enemy answers them from loudspeakers that pour out Communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity.
There is only one escape left, a tragic one, and too many people are taking it : suicide.
The normal rate of suicides in East Berlin was one a day, but since the border was closed on August 13 it has jumped to 25 a day ] these things may be happening many miles away from us but really they are right next door.
We are all involved in them, deeply involved.
And nobody knows what comes next.
We live from crisis to crisis.
And there is only one way for a man to conquer his fears in such a world.
He must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist said in a similar world : the Lord is my light and my salvation ; whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life ; of whom shall I be afraid?
Notice that this man had a threefold conception of God which is the secret of his faith.
First, the Lord is my light.
He lived in a very dark world, but he was not in the dark.
The same God who called this world into being when He said : let there be light ] -- those were His very first creative words -- He began the world with light -- this God still gives light to a world which man has plunged into darkness.
For those who put their trust in Him He still says every day again : let there be light ] and there is light ] in fact, He came into this world Himself, in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, who stood here amid the darkness of human sin and said : I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
The psalmist could say that God was his light even though he could only anticipate the coming of Christ.
He lived in the dawn ; he could only see the light coming over the horizon.
We live in the bright daylight of that great event ; for us it is a fact in history.
Why should we not have the same faith, and an even greater experience of the light which it gives?
This is the faith that moved the psalmist to add his second conception of God : the Lord is my salvation.
He knew that his God would save him from his enemies because He had saved him from his sins.
If God could do that, He could do anything.
The enemies at his gate, threatening to eat up his flesh, were nothing compared with the enemy of sin within his own soul.
And God had conquered that one by His grace ] so why worry about all the others?
The apostle Paul said the same thing in the language and faith of the New Testament : He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him freely give us all things?
If God be for us, who can be against us?
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
( Romans 31, 32, 35 ) salvation ] this is the key to the conquest of fear.
This gets down to the heart of our problem, for it reconciles us with God, whom we fear most of all because we have sinned against Him.
When that fear has been removed by faith in Jesus Christ, when we know that He is our Savior, that He has paid our debt with His blood, that He has met the demands of God's justice and thus has turned His wrath away -- when we know that, we have peace with God in our hearts ; and then, with this God on our side, we can face the whole world without fear.
And so the psalmist gives us one more picture of God : the Lord is the strength of my life.
The word is really stronghold.
It recalls those words of another psalm : God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations He hath made in the earth.
But, again, we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century A.*d., when an Arabic scholar, Tabit Ibn Korra ( 836-901 ) is said to have discussed the magic square of three.
Thus, while it remains possible that the Babylonians and/or the Pythagoreans may perhaps have had the magic square of three before the Chinese did, more definite evidence will have to turn up from the Middle East or the Classical World before China can lose her claim to the earliest known magic square by more than a thousand years.
2.
The Lo Shu square as an expression of centrality the concept of the Middle Kingdom at peace, strong and united under a forceful ruler, which had been only a longed-for ideal in the time of the Warring States, was finally realized by the establishment of a Chinese Empire under the Ch'in dynasty ( 221-207 B.*c. ).
But this was only accomplished by excessive cruelty and extremes of totalitarian despotism.
Among the many severe measures taken by the First Emperor, Shih Huang-ti, in his efforts to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity, was the burning of the books in 213 B.*c., with the expressed intention of removing possible sources for divergent thinking ; but, as he had a special fondness for magic and divination, he ordered that books on these subjects should be spared.
Many of the latter were destroyed in their turn, during the burning of the vast Ch'in palace some ten years later ; yet some must have survived, because the old interest in number symbolism, divination, and magic persisted on into the Han dynasty, which succeeded in reuniting China and keeping it together for a longer period ( from 202 B.*c. to A.*d. 220 ).
In fact, during the first century B.*c., an extensive literature sprang up devoted to these subjects, finding its typical expression in the so-called wei books, a number of which were specifically devoted to the Lo Shu and related numerical diagrams, especially in connection with divination.
However, the wei books were also destroyed in a series of Orthodox Confucian purges which culminated in a final proscription in 605.
After all this destruction of old literature, it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the Lo Shu, which was already semisecret anyhow.
But, in spite of all this, enough evidence remains to show that the magic square of three must indeed have been the object of a rather extensive cult -- or series of cults -- reaching fullest expression in the Han period.
Although modern scholars have expressed surprise that the simple magic square of three, a mere mathematical puzzle, was able to exert a considerable influence on the minds and imaginations of the cultured Chinese for so many centuries, they could have found most of the answers right within the square itself.
But, up to now, no one has attempted to analyze its inherent mathematical properties, or the numerical significance of its numbers -- singly or in combination -- and then tried to consider these in the light of Old Chinese cosmological concepts.
Such an analysis speedily reveals why the middle number of the Lo Shu, 5, was so vitally significant for the Chinese ever since the earliest hints that they had a knowledge of this diagram.
The importance of this 5 can largely be explained by the natural mathematical properties of the middle number and its special relationship to all the rest of the numbers -- quite apart from any numerological considerations, which is to say, any symbolic meaning arbitrarily assigned to it.
Indeed, mathematically speaking, it was both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram.
If one takes the middle number, 5, and multiplies it by 3 ( the base number of the magic square of three ), the result is 15, which is also the constant sum of all the rows, columns, and two main diagonals.
Then, if the middle number is activated to its greatest potential in terms of this square, through multiplying it by the highest number, 9 ( which is the square of the base number ), the result is 45 ; and the latter is the total sum of all the numbers in the square, by which all the other numbers are overshadowed and in which they may be said to be absorbed.
Furthermore, the middle number of the Lo Shu is not only the physical mean between every opposing pair of the other numbers, by reason of its central position ; it is also their mathematical mean, since it is equal to half the sum of every opposing pair, all of which equal 10.
In fact, the neat balance of these pairs, and their subtle equilibrium, would have had special meaning in the minds of the Old Chinese.
For they considered the odd numbers as male and the even ones as female, equating the two groups with the Yang and Yin principles in Nature ; and in this square, the respective pairs made up of large and small odd ( Yang ) numbers, and those composed of large and small even ( Yin ) numbers, were all equal to each other.
Thus all differences were leveled, and all contrasts erased, in a realm of no distinction, and the harmonious balance of the Lo Shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balanced harmony around a powerful central axis.
The tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the Lo Shu square -- for purely mathematical reasons -- and the fact that this number so neatly symbolized the heart and center of the universe, could well explain why the Old Chinese seem to have so revered the number 5, and why they put so much stress on the concept of Centrality.
These twin tendencies seem to have reached their height in the Han dynasty.
The existing reverence for Centrality must have been still further stimulated toward the close of the second century B.*c., when the Han Emperor Wu Ti ordered the dynastic color changed to yellow -- which symbolized the Center among the traditional Five Directions -- and took 5 as the dynastic number, believing that he would thus place himself, his imperial family, and the nation under the most auspicious influences.
His immediate motive for doing this may not have been directly inspired by the Lo Shu, but this measure must inevitably have increased the existing beliefs in the latter's efficacy.
After this time, inscriptions on the Han bronze mirrors, as well as other writings, emphasized the desirability of keeping one's self at the center of the universe, where cosmic forces were strongest.
Later, we shall see what happened when an emperor took this idea too literally.
All this emphasis on Centrality and on the number 5 as a symbolic expression of the Center, which seems to have begun as far back as 400 B.*c., also may conceivably have led to the development of the Five-*elements School and the subsequent efforts to fit everything into numerical categories of five.
We find, for example, such groupings as the Five Ancient Rulers, the Five Sacred Mountains, the Five Directions ( with Center ), the Five Metals, Five Colors, Five Tastes, Five Odors, Five Musical Notes, Five Bodily Functions, Five Viscera, and many others.
This trend has often been ascribed to the cult of the Five Elements itself, as though they had served as the base for all the rest ; but why did the Old Chinese postulate five elements, when the Ancient Near East -- which may have initiated the idea that natural elements exerted influence in human life and activities -- recognized only four?
And why did the Chinese suddenly begin to talk about the Five Directions, when the animals they used as symbols of the directions designated only the usual four?
Obviously, something suddenly caused them to start thinking in terms of fives, and that may have been the workings of the Lo Shu.
This whole tendency had an unfortunate effect on Chinese thinking.
Whereas the primary meanings of the Lo Shu diagram seemed to have been based on its inner mathematical properties -- and we shall see that even its secondary meanings rested on some mathematical bases -- the urgent desire to place everything into categories of fives led to other groupings based on other numbers, until an exaggerated emphasis on mere numerology pervaded Chinese thought.
Scholars made numbered sets of as many things as possible in Nature, or assigned arbitrary numbers to individual things, in a fashion that seems to the modern scientific mind as downright nonsensical, and philosophical ideas based upon all this tended to stifle speculative thought in China for many centuries.
3.
Yin and Yang in the Lo Shu square although the primary mathematical properties of the middle number at the center of the Lo Shu, and the interrelation of all the other numbers to it, might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the Lo Shu held for the Old Chinese philosophers, this was actually only a beginning of wonders.
For the Lo Shu square was a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical ideas of its time.
As such, one cannot fully understand the thought of the pre-*han and Han periods without knowing the meanings inherent in the Lo Shu but, conversely, one cannot begin to understand the Lo Shu without knowing something about the world view of the Old Chinese, which they felt they saw expressed in it.
The Chinese world view during the Han dynasty, when the Lo Shu seems to have been at the height of its popularity, was based in large part on the teachings of the Yin-*yang and Five-*elements School, which was traditionally founded by Tsou Yen.
According to this doctrine, the universe was ruled by Heaven, T'ien -- as a natural force, or in the personification of a Supreme Sky-god -- governing all things by means of a process called the Tao, which can be roughly interpreted as the Order of the Universe or the Universal Way.
Heaven, acting through the Tao, expressed itself by means of the workings of two basic principles, the Yin and the Yang.
The Yang, or male principle, was the source of light, heat, and dynamic vitality, associated with the Sun ; while the Yin, or female principle, flourished in darkness, cold, and quiet inactivity, and was associated with the Moon.
Together these two principles influenced all things, and in varying combinations they were present in everything.
We have already seen that odd numbers were considered as being Yang, while the even numbers were Yin, so that the eight outer numbers of the Lo Shu represented these two principles in balanced equilibrium around the axial center.
During the Han dynasty, another Yin-*yang conception was applied to the Lo Shu, considering the latter as a plan of Ancient China.
Instead of linking the nine numbers of this diagram with the traditional Nine Provinces, as was usually done, this equated the odd, Yang numbers with mountains ( firm and resistant, hence Yang ) and the even numbers with rivers ( sinuous and yielding, hence Yin ) ; taking the former from the Five Sacred Mountains of the Han period and the latter from the principal river systems of Old China.
Thus the middle number, 5, represented Sung-*shan in Honan, Central China ; the 3, T'ai-*shan in Shantung, East China ; the 7, Hwa-*shan in Shensi, West China ; the 1, Heng-*shan in Hopei, North China ( or the mountain with the same name in neighboring Shansi ) ; and the 9, Huo-*shan in Anhwei, which was then the South Sacred Mountain.
For the rivers, the 4 represented the Huai, to the ( then ) Southeast ; the 2, the San Kiang ( three rivers ) in the ( then ) Southwest ; the 8, the Chi in the Northeast ; and the 6, the ( upper ) Yellow River in the Northwest.
Note that by Western standards this plan was upside down, as it put North at the bottom and South at the top, with the other directions correspondingly altered ; but in this respect it was merely following the accepted Chinese convention for all maps.
The same arrangement was used when the Lo Shu was equated with the Nine Provinces ; and whenever the Lo Shu involved directional symbolism, it was oriented in this same fashion.
Few persons who join the Church are insincere.
They earnestly desire to do the will of God.
When they fall by the wayside and fail to achieve Christian stature, it is an indictment of the Church.
These fatalities are dramatic evidence of halfway evangelism, a failure to follow through.
A program of Lay Visitation Evangelism can end in dismal defeat with half the new members drifting away unless practical plans and strenuous efforts are made to keep them in the active fellowship.
The work of Lay Visitation Evangelism is not completed when all of the persons on the Responsibility List have been interviewed.
In the average situation about one-third of those visited make commitments to Christ and the Church.
The pastor and the Membership Preparation and Assimilation Committee must follow through immediately with a carefully planned program.
The first thirty to sixty days after individuals make their decision will determine their interest and participation in the life of the Church.
Neglect means spiritual paralysis or death.
Preparation for membership churches that have a carefully planned program of membership preparation and assimilation often keep 85 to 90 per cent of their new members loyal and active.
This is the answer to the problem of membership delinquency.
It is important that persons desiring to unite with the Church be prepared for this experience so that it may be meaningful and spiritually significant.
It is unfair and unchristian to ask a person to take the sacred vows of Church membership before he has been carefully instructed concerning their implications.
Preparation for Church membership begins immediately after the commitment is received.
1 ) the pastor writes a personal letter to each individual, expressing his joy over the decision, assuring him of a pastoral call at the earliest convenient time, and outlining the plan for membership preparation classes and Membership Sunday.
Some pastors write a letter the same night the decision is reported by the visitors.
It should not be postponed later than the next day.
A helpful leaflet may be enclosed in the letter.
2 ) the pastor calls in the home of each individual or family for a spiritual guidance conference.
If possible, he should make an appointment in order that all persons involved may be present.
This is not a social call.
It is definitely a spiritual guidance conference.
He will discuss the significance of Christian commitment, the necessity of family religion and private devotions, and the importance of the membership preparation sessions.
There may be problems of conduct or questions of belief which will require his counsel.
Each conference should be concluded naturally with prayer.
A piece of devotional material, such as the Upper Room, may be left in each home.
3 ) a minimum of four sessions of preparation for membership is necessary for adults.
Some churches require more.
None should ask less.
Those who join the Church need to be instructed in the faith and the meaning of Christian discipleship before they take the sacred vows.
They will have a greater appreciation for the Church and a deeper devotion to it if membership requires something of them.
Many churches find the Sunday school hour to be the most practical time for adult preparation classes.
Others meet on Sunday night, at the mid-week service, or for a series of four nights.
Some pastors have two sessions in one evening, with a refreshment period between.
The sessions should cover four major areas : A -- the Christian Faith ; B -- history of the Church ; C -- duties of Church Membership ; D -- the Local Church and its program.
Following each instruction period a piece of literature dealing with the topic should be handed each one for further reading during the week.
This procedure is much more effective than giving out a membership packet.
Fourth session important most pastors find that the fourth session should take at least two hours and therefore hold it on a week night prior to Reception Sunday.
In this session the persons seeking membership are provided information concerning the work of the denomination as well as the program and activities of the local church.
The lay leadership of the church may be invited to speak on the various phases of church life, service opportunities, the church school, missions, men's work, women's work, youth program, social activities, and finances.
The budget of the church may be presented and pledges solicited at this session.
An interest finder or talent sheet may be filled out by each person.
( see sample on pp. 78-79.
) the fourth session may be concluded with a tour of the church facilities and refreshments.
The social time gives an opportunity for church leaders to become acquainted with the new members.
Additional suggestions for membership preparation in conducting the Membership Preparation-*inquirers' Class, the pastor should plan a variety of teaching techniques in order to develop greater interest on the part of the class.
The following have been found effective.
1 ) extend the number of classes.
Some churches have six or more training sessions of two hours each, generally held on Sunday night or during the week.
This gives greater opportunity for the learning process.
2 ) use dramatization -- for example, in discussing the Lord's Supper or church symbolism.
3 ) use audio-visual aids.
Some excellent filmstrips with recordings and motion pictures may be secured from your denominational headquarters to enrich the class session.
4 ) have a Question Box.
Some new members will hesitate to ask questions audibly.
Urge them to write out their questions for the box.
5 ) use a textbook with assigned readings each week.
6 ) select class members for reports on various phases of the study.
7 ) conduct examinations, using a true-false check sheet.
8 ) ask each member to write a statement on such topics as : What Christ Means To Me, What The Church Means To Me, Why Join The Church, The Duties Of Church Members, etc..
9 ) assign a series of catechism questions to be memorized.
10 ) invite class members to share in an extra period of Bible study each week.
11 ) ask each new member to bring his Pledge of Loyalty to the Reception Service.
What about transfers?
There is a growing conviction among pastors and Church leaders that all those who come into the fellowship of the Church need preparatory training, including those coming by transfer of membership.
George E. Sweazey writes : there is danger in trying to make admission to the Church so easy and painless that people will scarcely know that anything has happened.
People appreciate experiences that demand something of them.
Those who transfer their membership are no exception to the rule.
For most of them, it will be their first experience in membership training, since this is a recent development in many churches.
Those coming from other denominations will welcome the opportunity to become informed.
The preparatory class is an introductory face-to-face group in which new members become acquainted with one another.
It provides a natural transition into the life of the local church and its organizations.
Reception into the Church Fellowship the total process of evangelism reaches the crescendo when the group of new members stands before the congregation to declare publicly their faith and to be received into the fellowship of the Church.
This should be a high moment in their lives, a never-to-be-forgotten experience.
They should sense the tremendous significance of joining the spiritual succession reaching back to Christ our Lord and forward to an eternal fellowship with the saints of the ages.
Every detail of the service merits careful attention -- the hymns, the sermon, the ritual, the right hand of fellowship, the introduction to the congregation, the welcome of the congregation.
This is a vital part of their spiritual growth and assimilation.
It will help to determine the attitude of the new members toward the Church.
It can mean the difference between participation and inaction, spiritual growth and decay.
The worship service is the natural and logical time to receive new members into the Church.
The atmosphere for this momentous experience can be created most effectively through the worship experience.
Psychologically the reception should be the climax, following the sermon.
1 ) ask the new members to meet thirty minutes before the service to complete talent sheets and pledge cards.
Some denominations ask new members to sign personally the chronological membership register.
Provide a name card for each new member.
Outline plans for the entire service.
2 ) arrange a reserved section in the sanctuary where all new members may sit together.
Sponsors may sit with them also.
3 ) invite sponsors or Fellowship Friends to stand back of the new members in the reception service.
4 ) give each new member a certificate of membership.
5 ) introduce each new member to the congregation, asking him to face the congregation.
6 ) lead the congregation in a response of welcome.
7 ) have a reception for new members in the parlor or social hall immediately after the service.
8 ) take a picture of the group of new members to be put in the church paper or placed on the bulletin board.
9 ) have a fellowship luncheon or dinner with new members as guests.
Chapter 6 planning for the assimilation and growth of new members the church is the family of God.
The members of the family are drawn together by a common love for Christ and a sincere devotion to His Kingdom.
Every member of the family must have a vital place in its life.
This is no spectator-type experience ; everyone is to be a participant.
Yet the most difficult problem in the Church's program of evangelism is right at this point -- helping new members to become participating, growing parts of the fellowship.
Very easily they may be neglected and eventually join the ranks of the unconcerned and inactive.
A study of major denominational membership statistics over a twenty-year period revealed the appalling fact that nearly 40 per cent of those who joined the Church were lost to the Church within seven years.
One denomination had a membership of 1,419,833 at the beginning of the period under study, and twenty years later its membership stood at 1,541,991 -- a net growth of only 122,158.
Yet during the same period there were 1,080,062 additions.
Another major church body had 4,499,608 members and twenty years later its membership stood at 4,622,444.
During this time 4,122,354 new members were brought into the fellowship.
Still another denomination had 7,360,187 members twenty years ago.
During this period 7,484,268 members were received, yet the net membership now is only 9,910,741.
These figures indicate that we are losing almost as many as we are receiving into membership.
This problem is illustrated by the fact that many local churches drop from the active membership rolls each year as many as they receive into the fellowship.
Studies of membership trends, even in some areas where population is expanding, show that numbers of churches have had little net increase, though many new members were received.
Something is wrong when these things happen.
The local family of God has failed its new members through neglect and unconcern for their spiritual welfare.
Basic needs new members can become participating, growing members.
But this will not happen merely through the natural process of social life.
It must be planned and carefully developed.
The entire membership of the local church must be alerted to their part in this dynamic process.
If the church has followed the plan of cultivation of prospects and carried through a program of membership preparation as outlined earlier in this book, the process of assimilation and growth will be well under way.
Those who enter the front door of the church intelligently and with Christian dedication will not so easily step through the back door because of lost interest.
However, it is not enough to bring persons to Christian commitment and train them in the meaning of Christian discipleship.
When they unite with the Church they must find in this fellowship the satisfaction of their basic spiritual needs or they will never mature into effective Christians.
The Church expects certain things of those who become members.
The new members justifiably expect some things from their church family : welcome into the fellowship -- sincere Christian love and understanding -- inspiring and challenging worship experiences -- social and recreational activities -- opportunities for Christian service -- opportunities for study of the Christian faith and the Bible -- creative prayer experiences -- guidance in Christian social concerns.
Men need unity and they need God.
Care must be taken neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor God with our parochial ideas about him, but with these two qualifications, the statement stands.
The statement also points to a classic paradox : the more men turn toward God, who is not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be established, the more men splinter into groups and set themselves apart from one another.
To be reminded of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious divisions have compounded political ones, with a resultant fragmentation of the human race.
Massacres attending the partition of India and the establishment of the State of Israel are simply recent grim evidences of the hostility such divisions can engender.
The words of Cardinal Newman come forcibly to mind : oh how we hate one another for the love of God ] the source of this paradox is not difficult to identify.
It lies in institutions.
Institutions require structure, form, and definition, and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion.
A completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in terms ; to escape this fate, it must rule some things out.
For every criterion which defines what something is, at the same time proclaims -- implicitly if not openly -- what that something is not.
Some persons are so sensitive to this truth as to propose that we do away with institutions altogether ; in the present context this amounts to the advice that while being religious may have a certain justification, we ought to dispense with churches.
The suggestion is naive.
Man is at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating being.
Having once committed himself to an ideal which he considers worthwhile, he inevitably creates forms for its expression and institutions for its continuance.
To propose that men be religious without having religious institutions is like proposing that they be learned without having schools.
Both eventualities are possible logically, but practically they are impossible.
As much as men intrinsically need the unity that is grounded in God, they instrumentally require the institutions that will direct their steps toward him.
Yet the fact remains that such institutions do set men at odds with their fellows.
Is there any way out of the predicament?
The only way that I can see is through communication.
Interfaith communication need not be regarded as an unfortunate burden visited upon us by the necessity of maintaining diplomatic relations with our adversaries.
Approached creatively, it is a high art.
It is the art of relating the finite to the infinite, of doing our best to insure that the particularistic requirements of religious institutions will not thwart God's intent of unity among men more than is minimally necessary.
In a certain sense, interfaith communication parallels diplomatic communication among the nation-states.
What are the pertinent facts affecting such communication at the present juncture of history?
I shall touch on three areas : personal, national, and theological.
1 ) by personal factors I mean those rooted in personality structure.
Some interfaith tensions are not occasioned by theological differences at all, but by the need of men to have persons they can blame, distrust, denounce, and even hate.
Such needs may rise to pathological proportions.
Modern psychology has shown that paralleling the authoritarian personality is the bigoted personality in which insecurity, inferiority, suspicion, and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufactured if it does not exist naturally.
Fortunately the number of pathological bigots appears to be quite small, but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separates them from the rest of us.
To some extent the personal inadequacies that prejudices attempt to compensate for are to be found in all of us.
Interfaith conflicts which spring from psychological deficiencies are the most unfortunate of all, for they have no redeeming features whatsoever.
It is difficult to say what can be done about them except that we must learn to recognize when it is they, rather than pretexts for them, that are causing the trouble, and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personalities that will prevent the development of such deficiencies.
2 ) while the personality factors that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial, nationalism is more variable.
The specific instance I have in mind is the Afro-*asian version which has gained prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century.
Emerging from the two centuries of colonial domination, the Afro-*asian world is aflame with a nationalism that has undone empires.
No less than twenty-two nations have already achieved independence since World War 2, and the number is growing by the year.
As an obvious consequence, obstacles to genuine interfaith communication have grown more formidable in one important area : relations between Christians and non-*christians in these lands.
Colonialism alone would have been able to make these difficulties serious, for Christianity is so closely tied to colonialism in the minds of these people that repudiation of the one has tended automatically toward the repudiation of the other.
Actually, however, this turns out to be only part of the picture.
Nationalism has abetted not only the repudiation of foreign religions but the revival of native ones, some of which had been lying in slumber for centuries.
The truth is that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and Volksgeist which these young nations very much need.
Insofar as these nations claim to incarnate traditions and ways of life which constitute ultimate, trans-political justifications for their existence, such people are inevitably led to emphasize the ways in which these traditions and ways are theirs rather than someone else's.
All this works severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which Christian missions stand.
Africans and Asians tend to consider not only missions but the local churches they have produced as centers and agents of Western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda.
The people hardest hit by this suspicion are, of course, Christians on the mainland of China.
But the problem extends elsewhere.
For example, in Burma and Ceylon many Buddhists argue that Buddhism ought to be the official state religion.
In 1960 Ceylon nationalized its sectarian -- preponderantly Christian -- schools, to the rejoicing of most of its 7,000,000 Buddhists and the lament of its 800,000 Roman Catholics.
Again, India has imposed formidable barriers against the entrance of additional missionaries, and fanatical Hindu parties are expected to seek further action against Christians once the influence making for tolerance due to Nehru and his followers is gone.
The progressive closing of Afro-*asian ears to the Christian message is epitomized in a conversation I had three years ago while flying from Jerusalem to Cairo.
I was seated next to the director of the Seventh Day Adventists' world radio program.
He said that on his tour the preceding year a considerable number of hours would have been available to him on Japanese radio networks, but that he had then lacked the funds to contract for them.
After returning to the United States and raising the money, he discovered on getting back to Japan that the hours were no longer available.
It was not that they had been contracted for during the interval ; they simply could no longer be purchased for missionary purposes.
It is not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sects toward the cultures and religions among which they work has contributed measurably to this heightening of anti-*christian sentiment.
Ironically, these are the groups which have doubled or tripled their missionary efforts since World War 2, while the more established denominations are barely maintaining pre-war staffs.
Although I have emphasized the barriers which an aroused nationalism has raised against relations between Christians and non-*christians in Asia, the fact is that this development has also widened the gulf between certain Afro-*asian religions themselves.
The partition of India has hardly improved relations between Hindus and Muslims ; neither has the establishment of the State of Israel fostered harmony between Muslims and Jews.
3 ) I turn finally to several theological developments.
1.
Theocracy reconsidered.
The modern world has been marked by progressive disaffection with claims to divine sanction for the state, whatever its political form.
The American Constitution was historic at this point in providing that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
One of our foremost jurists, David Dudley Field, has gone so far as to call this provision the greatest achievement ever made in the course of human history.
The trend throughout the world's religions has been toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment.
Pakistan was created in 1947 expressly as a Muslim state, but when the army took over eleven years later it did so on a wave of mass impatience which was directed in part against the inability of political and religious leaders to think their way through to the meaning of Islam for the modern political situation.
What is the point, Charles Adams reports the Pakistanis as asking, in demanding an Islamic state and society if no one, not even the doctors of the sacred law themselves, can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society is?
The current regime of President Mohammad Ayub Khan is determinedly secular.
And while the nation was formerly named The Islamic Republic of Pakistan, it is now simply The Republic of Pakistan.
Comparable trends can be noted elsewhere.
The new regime in Turkey is intentionally less Muslim than its predecessor.
The religious parties in Israel have experienced a great loss of prestige in recent months.
During the years when Israel was passing from crisis to crisis -- the Sinai campaign, the infusion of multitudes of penniless immigrants -- it was felt that the purpose of national unity could be best served if the secular majority were to yield to the religious parties.
Now that Israel enjoys relative prosperity and a reduction of tensions, the secularists are less disposed to compromise.
And in this country Gustave Weigel's delineation of the line between the sacral and secular orders during the last presidential campaign served to provide a most impressive Roman Catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state.
The failure at that time of the Puerto Rican bishops to control the votes of their people added a ring of good sense to Father Weigel's theological argument.
Everywhere there seems to be a growing recognition of the fact that governments and religious institutions alike are too fallible and corruptible -- in a word, too human -- to warrant any claim of maintaining partnership with the divine.
2.
Salvation reconsidered.
My father went as a missionary to China in a generation that responded to Student Volunteer Movement speakers who held watches in their hands and announced to the students in their audiences how many Chinese souls were going to hell each second because these students were not over there saving them.
That mention of this should bring smiles to our lips today is as clear an indication as we could wish of the extent to which attitudes have changed.
I do not mean to imply that Christians have adopted the liberal assumption, so prevalent in Hinduism, that all religions are merely different paths to the same summit.
Leslie Newbiggin reflects the dominant position within the World Council of Churches when he says, we must claim absoluteness and finality for Christ and His finished work, but that very claim forbids us to claim absoluteness and finality for our understanding of it.
Newbiggin's qualification on the Christian claim is of considerable significance.
The Roman Catholic Church has excommunicated one of its priests, Father Feeney, for insisting that there is no salvation outside the visible church.
In mentioning this under salvation reconsidered I do not mean to imply that Roman Catholic doctrine has changed in this area but rather that it has become clearer to the world community what that doctrine is.
When they say that under no circumstances would it ever be right to permit the termination of the human race by human action, because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing, they know exactly what they mean.
Of course, in prudential calculation, in balancing the good directly intended and done against the evil unintended and indirectly done, no greater precision can be forthcoming than the subject allows.
Yet it seems clear that there can be no good sufficiently great, or evil repelled sufficiently grave, to warrant the destruction of mankind by man's own action.
I mean, however, that the moral theologian knows what he means by permit.
He is not talking in the main about probabilities, risks and danger in general.
He is talking about an action which just as efficaciously does an evil thing ( and is known certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result ) as it efficaciously does some good.
He is talking about double effects, of which the specific action causes directly the one and indirectly the other, but causes both ; of which one is deliberately willed or intended and the other not intended or not directly intended, but still both are done, while the evil effect is, with equal consciousness on the part of the agent, foreknown to be among the consequences.
This is what, in a technical sense, to only permit an evil result means.
It means to do it and to know one is doing it, but as only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily does and intends.
Of course, grave guiltiness may be imputed to the military action of any nation, or to the action of any leader or leaders, which for any supposed good permits, in this sense, the termination of the human race by human action.
Certainly, in analyzing an action which truly faced such alternatives, it is never possible that no world would be preferable to some worlds, and there are in truth no circumstances in which the destruction of human life presents itself as a reasonable alternative.
Naturally, where one or the other of the effects of an action is uncertain, this has to be taken into account.
Especially is this true when, because the good effect is remote and speculative while the evil is certain and grave, the action is prohibited.
Presumably, if the reverse is the case and the good effect is more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming, not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weighed and found proportionate, but also calculation of the probabilities and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be taken into account.
There must not only be greater good than evil objectively in view, but also greater probability of actually doing more good than harm.
If an evil which is certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensated for by a problematic, speculative, future good, by the same token not every present, certain, and immediate good ( or lesser evil ) that may have to be done will be outweighed by a problematic, speculative, and future evil.
Nevertheless, according to the traditional theory, a man begins in the midst of action and he analyzes its nature and immediate consequences before or while putting it forth and causing these consequences.
He does not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequences of his action.
Above all, he does not debate mere contingencies, and therefore, if these are possibly dreadful, find himself forced into inaction.
He does what he can and may and must, without regarding himself as lord of the future or, on the other hand, as covered with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequences or by results he did not permit in the sense explained.
By contrast, a good deal of nuclear pacifism begins with the contingencies and the probabilities, and not with the moral nature of the action to be done ; and by deriving legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result, whether by anyone's doing or by accident, it finds itself driven to inaction, to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affairs, and to the not very surprising discovery that there are now no distinctions on which the defense of justice can possibly be based.
Mr. Philip Toynbee writes, for example, that in terms of probability it is surely as likely as not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continues.
If it continues indefinitely it is nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be made and that the devastation will begin.
Against such a termination of human life on earth by human action, he then proposes as an alternative that we negotiate at once with the Russians and get the best terms which are available, that we deliberately negotiate from comparative weakness.
He bravely attempts to face this alternative realistically, i.e., by considering the worst possible outcome, namely, the total domination of the world by Russia within a few years.
This would be by far the better choice, when it is a question of allowing the human race to survive, possibly under the domination of a regime which most of us detest, or of allowing it to destroy itself in appalling and prolonged anguish.
Nevertheless, the consequence of the policy proposed is everywhere subtly qualified : it is a possible result, however improbable ; the worst, and least probable result ; if it didn't prevail mankind would still be given the opportunity of prevailing ; for surely anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war.
If we have not thought and made a decision entirely in these terms, then we need to submit ourselves to the following simple test : have we decided how we are to kill the other members of our household in the event of our being less injured than they are?
Thus, moral decision must be entirely deduced backward from the likely eventuality ; it is no longer to be formulated in terms of the nature of present action itself, its intention, and proximate effect or the thing to be done.
Several of the replies to Mr. Toynbee, without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil, succeed in restoring the actual context in which present moral and political decisions must be made, by distinguishing between choosing a great evil and choosing in danger of this evil.
It is worse for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation.
I am consciously prepared to run the continued risk of race suicide by accident rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design.
But I can only make this choice because I believe that the risk need not increase, but may be deliberately reduced ( by precautions against accidents or by limiting war?
) quoting Mr. Kennan's phrase that anything would be better than a policy which led inevitably to nuclear war, he ( Toynbee ) says that anything is better than a policy which allows for the possibility of nuclear war.
If asked to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility, most men will choose the latter.
If Philip Toynbee is claiming that the choice lies between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war, I think he is right.
I do not accept that the choice is between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war.
Even Professor Arnold Toynbee, agreeing with his son, does so in these terms : compared to continuing to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race, all other evils are lesser evils.
Let us therefore put first things first, and make sure of preserving the human race at whatever the temporary price may be.
Mr. Philip Toynbee affirms at one point that if he shared the anticipations of Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-*four, if he believed Communism was not only evil but also irredeemably evil, then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world.
Even a nuclear holocaust is a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanised humans occupying the earth until doomsday.
No political order or economic system is so clearly contrary to nature.
But one does not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense, or a static order in which no changes will take place in time, to be able truthfully to affirm the following fact : there has never been justitia imprinted in social institutions and social relationships except in the context of some pax-ordo preserved by clothed or naked force.
On their way to the Heavenly City the children of God make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge their share in responsibility for its preservation.
Not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo means not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenges it at the moment, but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand.
Toynbee seems to think that there is some other way to give justice social embodiment.
I would far rather die after a Russian occupation of this country -- by some deliberate act of refusal -- than die uselessly by atomisation.
Would such an act of refusal be useful?
He does not mean, in fact he addresses himself specifically to reject the proposition, that if we took the risk of surrendering, a new generation in Britain would soon begin to amass its strength in secret in order to reverse the consequences of that surrender.
He wants to be brutally frank and say that these rebellions would be hopeless -- far, far more hopeless than was the Hungarian revolution of 1956.
This is not a project for regaining the ground for limited war, by creating a monopoly in one power of the world's arsenal of unlimited weapons.
It is a proposal that justice now be served by means other than those that have ever preconditioned the search for it, or preconditioned more positive means for attaining it, in the past.
It is no good recommending surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be followed by the effective military resistance by occupied peoples.
Hope for the future would lie in the natural longing of the human race for freedom and the right to develop.
This is to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mounted, to the very last ; it is to stride along the steep slope downward.
The only contrary action, in the future as in the past, runs the risk of war ; and, now and in the future unlike in the past, any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilized attainment of mankind or its provisional justice runs some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will, by human action, render this planet less habitable by the human race.
That is why it is so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision as to permitted effects, and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibilities or probabilities unrelated, or not directly morally related, to what we can and may and must do as long as human history endures.
Finally, just as no different issues are posed for thoughtful analysis by the foreshortening of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth, but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination, the same thing must be said in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be doing, by human action, to accelerate this end.
We should not allow the image of an immanent end brought about indirectly by our own action in the continuing human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind us to the fact that in some measure accelerating the end of our lease may be one consequence among others of many other of mankind's thrusts toward we know not what future.
Much more than shelter, housing symbolizes social status, a sense of belonging, acceptance within a given group or neighborhood, identification with particular cultural values and social institutions, feelings of pride and worth, aspirations and hopes basic to human well-being.
For almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence casts a considerable shadow upon these values assumed as self-evident by most Americans.
Few business groups in recent years have come under heavier pressure to face these realities than real estate brokers and home builders.
This pressure has urged re-evaluation of the assumptions underlying their professional ethics ; it has sought new sympathy for the human aspirations of racial minority groups in this country.
It is not surprising that, as spokesman for real estate interests, the National Association of Real Estate Boards ( N*a*r*e*b ) and its local associations have sought to limit and often ignore much of this pressure.
How does the local realtor see himself in the context of housing restrictions based on race, religion or ethnic attachment?
What does he conceive his role to be in this area of social unrest?
What ought to be, what is his potential role as a force for constructive social change?
What social, ethical and theological insights can the church and university help him bring to bear upon his situation?
Recently, a group of the faculty at Wesleyan University's Public Affairs Center sought some answers to these questions.
Several New England realtors were invited to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyers, political scientists, economists, social psychologists, social ethicists and theologians.
Here, in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism, each sought to bring his particular insights to bear upon the question of discrimination in housing and the part each man present played in it.
For a number of years, Wesleyan has been drawing varied groups of political and business leaders into these informal discussions with members of the faculty and student body, attempting to explore and clarify aspects of their responsibility for public policy.
This article presents our observations of that session, of the realtors as they saw themselves and as the faculty and students saw them.
Such conversation quickly reveals an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-images held by most realtors.
Within the membership of this group, as has been found true of men in other professional or trade associations, the most ready portrayal of oneself to the public is that of a neutral agent simply serving the interests of a seller or buyer and mediating between them.
Professional responsibility is seen to consist largely in serving the wishes of the client fairly and in an efficient manner.
But as conversation goes on, particularly among the realtors themselves, another image emerges, that of considerable power and influence in the community.
Obviously, much more than customer expectation is determining the realtor's role.
Judgments are continually rendered regarding the potential buyers' income, educational level and above all, racial extraction ; and whether these would qualify them for congenial, happy relations to other people in certain community areas.
A narrow professionalism how explicit such factors have been historically is evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant cases or in a review of *j Code of Ethics Article 34 in the Code, adopted in 1924, states that a Realtor should never be instrumental in introducing into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy, members of any race or nationality or any individuals whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property values in that neighborhood.
Though the reference to race was stricken by the association in 1950, being an agent of such detrimental influences still appears as the cardinal sin realtors see themselves committed to avoid.
The rationale for this avoidance was most frequently expressed in economic terms ; all feared the supposed stigma they believed would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduced non-white, particularly Negro, peoples into all-white, restricted areas.
They would become tagged as men not interested in being purely real estate professionals but agitators for some kind of cause or reform, and this was no longer to be a pro.
Obviously what we are confronted with here is the identification of professional with narrow skills and specialization, the effective servicing of a client, rather than responsiveness to the wider and deeper meaning and associations of one's work.
These men -- for the most part educated in our best New England colleges, well established financially and socially in the community -- under kindly but insistent probing, reveal little or no objective or explicit criteria or data for their generalizations about the interests and attitudes of the people they claim to serve, or about the public responses that actually follow their occasional breach of a client-service relationship.
This narrow professionalism does not even fit the present realities of their situation, as the pressure of minorities and the power and respectability of the realtors increase.
As our discussion continued, the inadequacy of the client relationship as an interpretation of their way of operating became evident.
Realtors live in their communities as specialists in a given area of work, as members of social and professional organizations, as citizens and civic leaders, as church laymen, as university alumni, as newspaper readers, etc..
From such communal roles the realtor finds the substance that shapes his moral understanding.
It seems to us that choices exercised by realtors in moral situations center in at least three areas : ( 1 ) the various ways in which they interpret a particular social issue ; ( 2 ) their pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political processes ; and, most pervasively, ( 3 ) their interpretation of who is a real pro, of what it means to be a professional man in a technical, fragmented society.
( 1 ) most of the realtors minimized their own understanding of and role in the racial issue, pleading that they only reflect the attitudes and intentions of their society.
There is some reality to this ; the Commission on Race and Housing concluded that there is no reason to believe that real estate men are either more or less racially prejudiced, on the whole, than any other segment of the American population.
But such a reaction obscures the powerful efforts made in the past by both *j and its local boards for the maintenance of restrictive clauses and practices.
Also, it does not recognize the elements of choice and judgment continually employed.
Like business and university groups generally, these men had very limited knowledge of recent sociological and psychological studies and findings that might illumine the decisions they make.
Realtors, both generally and in this group, have invariably equated residential integration with a decline in property values, a circumstance viewed with considerable apprehension.
Recent studies by the Commission on Race and Housing and others, however, point to a vast complex of factors that often do not warrant this conclusion.
There are increasing numbers of neighborhoods that are integrated residentially without great loss of property values, the white population having taken the initiative in preparing the areas for an appreciation of the Negroes' desire for well-kept housing, privacy, etc..
Data on the decline of property values in an area after a new racial group enters it has to be assessed in terms of the trends in property values before the group comes in.
Often they are able to get in only because the area is declining economically.
Significantly, no realtor and few of the faculty present were familiar with any of the six volumes ( published by the University of California Press ) that present the commission's findings.
No one anticipates any radical shift in this situation, but questions concerning reading habits, the availability of such data and the places where it is discussed must surely be raised.
The role of both church and university as sources of information and settings within which the implications of such information may be explored needs consideration.
Relevant facts, however, extend beyond considerations of property values and maintenance of harmonious neighborhoods.
Discussion of minority housing necessarily involves such basic issues as the intensity of one's democratic conviction and religious belief concerning equality of opportunity, the function and limitations of government in the securing of such equality, and the spotlight that world opinion plays upon local incidents of racial agitation and strife.
Against the grain of creation ( 2 ) realtors realize, of course, that they are involved in an increasingly complex legal and political system that is opening up opportunities for leverage on their relation to clients as well as opportunities for evasion of their responsibility for racial discrimination in housing.
On the positive side, recent Federal action has largely undermined the legal sanction so long enjoyed by the segregationist position ; anti-discriminatory statutes in housing have now been adopted by thirteen states and, while specific provisions have varied, the tendency is clearly toward expanding coverage.
Realtors in attendance at the colloquium expressed interest, for example, in Connecticut's new housing law as setting standards of equity that they would like to have to obey, but in support of which none had been willing to go on public record.
As far as they were aware, the Connecticut Association of Real Estate Boards had not officially opposed the bill's passage or lobbied in its support.
( this has not been the case everywhere.
In 1957, the Real Estate Boards of New York City actively opposed the then pending private housing anti-discrimination law.
Official reasoning : the bill was a wanton invasion of basic property rights.
) there are sins of omission as well as commission ; the attitude adopted by realtors and their associations, either negative or positive, plays a large part in the public acceptance of such measures and the degree to which they may be effectively enforced.
Judicial opinion since the Supreme Court decision on Shelley v. Kraemer ( 1948 ) has rendered racial restrictive covenants unenforcible.
Such a decision should have placed a powerful weapon in the hands of the entire housing industry, but there is little evidence that realtors, or at least their associations, have repudiated the principle in such clauses.
In the states that have passed laws preventing discrimination in the sale or rental of housing, support by real estate associations for compliance and broadened coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of social reformism that most realtors individually seem determined to avoid.
But as yet, no real estate board has been willing officially to support such laws or to admit the permissibility of introducing minority buyers into all-white neighborhoods.
One of the roles of the social scientist, ethicist or theologian in our discussions with the realtors became that of encouraging greater awareness of the opportunities offered by the legal and political processes for the exercise of broad social responsibilities in their work.
But responsiveness to these opportunities presumes that all of us judge the good as a human good and not simply as a professional, white, American good.
Such judgments are meaningful only in so far as persons are members of a world, let us say a community, that embraces Scarsdale or Yonkers, but is also infinitely richer since it is all-inclusive.
That community of all creation is, then, the ultimate object of our loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment.
Racial discrimination is wrong, then, not because it goes against the grain of a faculty member trying to converse with a few realtors but because it goes against the grain of creation and against the will of the Creator.
Thus, moral issues concerning the nature of the legal and political processes take on theological dimensions.
A fragmented Society ( 3 ) over the years, individuals engaged in the sale of real estate have developed remarkable unity in the methods and practices employed.
Most realtors and real estate brokers talk of themselves as professional people with the cultural and moral values held by the traditional professions.
But what significance attaches to professional, beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meeting a client's stated needs as already noted?
Our faculty and students pressed this issue more than any other.
As a theologian in the group pointed out, a professional was, before the modern period of technical specialization, one who professed to be a bearer and critic of his culture in the use of his particular skills.
If we look about the world today, we can see clearly that there are two especially significant factors shaping the future of our civilization : science and religion.
Science is placing in our hands the ultimate power of the universe, the power of the atom.
Religion, or the lack of it, will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind, or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroyed.
How can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge?
We may feel pessimistic at the outlook.
And yet there is a note of hope, because this same science that is giving us the power of the atom is also giving us atomic vision.
We are looking inside the atom and seeing there a universe which is not material but something beyond the material, a universe that in a word is not matter but music.
And it is in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of our faith.
Atomic energy to see this vision in perspective, we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom.
You know that I could hold right here in my hand the little chunk of uranium metal that was the heart of the bomb that dropped on Hiroshima.
It was only about the size of a baseball ; but packed in that metallic ball there was the explosive force of 20,000 tons of *j.
That is enough *j to fill the tower of the Empire State Building ; and with the availability of bombs of that size, war became a new problem.
Now we might have restricted the use of uranium bombs by controlling the sources of uranium because it is found in only a few places in the world.
But we had hardly started to adjust our thinking to this new uranium weapon when we were faced with the hydrogen bomb.
Hydrogen is just as plentiful as uranium is scarce.
We know that we have hydrogen in water ; water is *f and the *j stands for hydrogen ; there is also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in our bodies.
I have calculated that if I could snap my fingers in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in my body, I would explode with the force of a hundred bombs of the kind that fell on Hiroshima.
I won't try the experiment, but I think you can see that if we all knew the secret and we could all let ourselves go, there would be quite an explosion.
And then think how little hydrogen we have in us compared with the hydrogen in Delaware Bay or in the ocean beyond.
Salt water is still *f, the same hydrogen is there.
And the size of the ocean shows us the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in our hands today.
Of course, there is also an optimistic side to the picture.
For if I knew the secret of letting this power in my body change directly into electricity, I could rent myself out to the electric companies and with just the power in my body I could light all the lights and run all the factories in the entire United States for some days.
And think, if we all knew this secret and we could pool our power, what a wonderful public utility company we would make.
With just the hydrogen of our bodies, we could run the world for years.
Then think of Delaware Bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of years to come.
It is power with which we can literally rebuild the world, provide adequate housing, food, education, abundant living for everyone everywhere.
An octillion atoms now let us see where this power comes from.
To grasp our new view of the atom, we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom is.
I have been trying to make this clear to my own class in chemistry.
One night there were some dried peas lying on our kitchen table, and these peas looked to me like a little group of atoms ; and I asked myself a question : suppose I had the same number of peas as there are atoms in my body, how large an area would they cover?
I calculated first that there are about an octillion atoms in the average human body ; that is a figure one with 27 ciphers, quite a large number.
Then I calculated that a million peas would just about fill a household refrigerator ; a billion peas would fill a small house from cellar to attic ; a trillion peas would fill all the houses in a town of about ten thousand people ; and a quadrillion peas would fill all the buildings in the city of Philadelphia.
I saw that I would soon run out of buildings at this rate, so I decided to take another measure -- the whole state of Pennsylvania.
Imagine that there is a blizzard over Pennsylvania, but instead of snowing snow, it snows peas ; so we get the whole state covered with peas, about four feet deep.
You can imagine what it would look like going out on the turnpike with the peas banked up against the houses and covering the cars ; Pennsylvania thus blanketed would contain about a quintillion peas.
But we still have a long way to go.
Next we imagine our blizzard raging over all the land areas of the entire globe -- North America, South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa, all covered with peas four feet deep ; then we have sextillion peas.
Next we freeze over the oceans and cover the whole earth with peas, then we go out among the neighboring stars, collect 250 planets each the size of the earth, and also cover each of these with peas four feet deep ; and then we have septillion.
Finally we go into the farthest reaches of the Milky Way ; we get 250,000 planets ; we cover each of these with our blanket of peas and then at last we have octillion peas corresponding in number to the atoms in the body.
So you see how small an atom is and how complicated you are.
A speck -- and space now although an atom is small, we can still in imagination have a look at it.
Let us focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of my finger and let us suppose that I swallow a magic Alice In Wonderland growing pill.
I start growing rapidly and this calcium atom grows along with me.
I shoot up through the roof, into the sky, past the clouds, through the stratosphere, out beyond the moon, out among the planets, until I am over a hundred and fifty million miles long.
Then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yards across, a balloon big enough to put a football field inside.
And if you should step inside of such a magnified atom, according to the physics of forty years ago, you would see circulating over your head, down at the sides, and under your feet, some twenty luminous balls about the size of footballs.
These balls are moving in great circles and ellipses, and are of course, the electrons, the particles of negative electricity which by their action create the forces that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atoms of oxygen and make up the solid structure of my finger bone.
Since these electrons are moving like planets, you may wonder whether there is an atomic sun at the center of the atom.
So you look down there and you see a tiny, whirling point about the size of the head of a pin.
This is the atomic sun, the atomic nucleus.
Even if the atom were big enough to hold a football field, this nucleus is still only about the size of a pinhead.
It is this atomic nucleus that contains the positive charge of electricity holding these negatively charged electrons in their orbits ; it also contains nearly all the mass, and the atomic energy.
You may ask what else there is, and the answer is nothing -- nothing but empty space.
And since you are made of atoms, you are nothing much but empty space, too.
If I could put your body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down, squeeze these holes out of you in the way we squeeze the holes out of a sponge, you would get smaller and smaller until finally when the last hole was gone, you would be smaller than the smallest speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper.
Someone has remarked that this is certainly the ultimate in reducing.
At any rate, it shows us how immaterial we are.
Music of the spheres now this 1920 view of the atom was on the whole a discouraging picture.
For we believed that the electrons obeyed the law of mechanics and electrodynamics ; and therefore the atom was really just a little machine ; and in mechanics the whole is no more than the sum of the parts.
So if you are made of atoms, you are just a big machine ; and since the universe is also made of atoms, it is just a supermachine.
And this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe, governed by the laws of cause and effect, bound in chains of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermined course in which there is not room for soul or spirit or human freedom.
And this is why so many scientists a half a century ago were agnostics or atheists.
Then came the scientific revolution in the late 1920's.
A suggestion from Louis De Broglie, a physicist in France, showed us that these electrons are not point particles but waves.
And to see the meaning of this new picture, imagine that you can put on more powerful glasses and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today.
Now as you step inside, instead of seeing particles orbiting around like planets, you see waves and ripples very much like the ripples that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it.
These ripples spread out in symmetrical patterns like the rose windows of a great cathedral.
And as the waves flow back and forth and merge with the waves from the neighboring atoms, you can put on a magic hearing aid and you hear music.
It is a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra playing a symphony.
Harmony, melody, counterpoint symphonic structure are there ; and as this music ebbs and flows, there is an antiphonal chorus from all the atoms outside, in fact from the atoms of the entire universe.
And so today when we examine the structure of our knowledge of the atom and of the universe, we are forced to conclude that the best word to describe our universe is music.
The Island of Nantucket, part of the State of Massachusetts, lies about thirty-one miles southeast of its mother State.
Some of the Island is sand and is not suitable for living.
The Island folk have their living almost entirely from summer visitors ; the rest is obtained from harbor scallops.
During about three and a half months of the year, in the summer, there are three boats that run from the mainland to the Island carrying passengers, food, and cars ; but the rest of the year only one boat is needed, which ties up at the mainland nights and makes the trip down to Nantucket in the daytime.
This is a fine trip, too, on a good day.
With Martha's Vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other, it makes an excellent trip of about three hours.
To what extent and in what ways did Christianity affect the United States of America in the nineteenth century?
How far and in what fashion did it modify the new nation which was emerging in the midst of the forces shaping the revolutionary age?
To what extent did it mould the morals and the social, economic, and political life and institutions of the country?
A complete picture is impossible -- partly because of the limitations of space, partly because for millions of individuals who professed allegiance to the Christian faith data are unobtainable.
Even more of an obstacle is the difficulty of separating the influence of Christianity from other factors.
Although a complete picture cannot be given, we can indicate some aspects of life into which the Christian faith entered as at least one creative factor.
At times we can say that it was the major factor.
What in some ways was the most important aspect was the impact individually on the millions who constituted the nation.
As we have seen, a growing proportion, although in 1914 still a minority, were members of churches.
Presumably those who did not have a formal church connexion had also felt the influence of Christianity to a greater or lesser extent.
Many of them had once been members of a church or at least had been given instruction in Christianity but for one or another reason had allowed the connexion to lapse.
The form of Christianity to which they were exposed was for some the Protestantism of the older stock, for others the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration ; for still others, mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration, it was Roman Catholicism, and for a small minority it was Eastern Orthodoxy.
Upon all of them played the intellectual, social, political, and economic attitudes, institutions, and customs of the nation.
Upon most of these Christianity had left an impress and through them had had a share in making the individual what he was.
Yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what ways any individual showed the effects of Christianity would be impossible.
At best only an approximation could be arrived at.
To generalize for the entire nation would be absurd.
For instance, we cannot know whether even for church members the degree of conformity to Christian standards of morality increased or declined as the proportion of church members in the population rose.
The temptation is to say that, as the percentage of church members mounted, the degree of discipline exercised by the churches lessened and the trend was towards conformity to the general level.
Yet this cannot be proved.
We know that in the early part of the century many Protestant congregations took positive action against members who transgressed the ethical codes to which the majority subscribed.
Thus Baptist churches on the frontier took cognizance of charges against their members of drunkenness, fighting, malicious gossip, lying, cheating, sexual irregularities, gambling, horse racing, and failure to pay just debts.
If guilty, the offender might be excluded from membership.
As church membership burgeoned, such measures faded into desuetude.
But whether this was accompanied by a general lowering of the moral life of the membership we do not know.
What we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusions is to point out the manner in which Christianity entered into particular aspects of the life of the nation.
We have already hinted at the fashion in which Christianity contributed to education and so to intellectual life.
We will now speak of the ways in which it helped shape the ideals of the country and of the manner in which it stimulated efforts to attain those ideals through reform movements, through programmes for bringing the collective life to the nation to conformity to Christian standards, and through leaders in the government.
Throughout the nineteenth century Christianity exerted its influence on American society as a whole primarily through the Protestantism of the older stock.
By the end of the century the Roman Catholic Church was beginning to make itself felt, mainly through such institutions as hospitals but also through its attitude towards organized labour.
In the twentieth century its influence grew, as did that of the Protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration.
The American dream the ideals of the country were deeply indebted to the Protestantism of the older stock.
Thus America, the most widely sung of the patriotic songs, was written by a New England Baptist clergyman, Samuel Francis Smith ( 1808-1895 ), while a student in Andover Theological Seminary.
With its zeal for liberty and its dependence on God it breathed the spirit which had been nourished on the Evangelical revivals.
The great seal of the United States was obviously inspired by the Christian faith.
Here was what was called the American dream, namely, the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that God could bless it.
Later in the century the dream again found expression in the lines of Katherine Lee Bates ( 1859-1929 ), daughter and granddaughter of New England Congregational ministers, in her widely sung hymn, written in 1893, America The Beautiful, with the words o beautiful for pilgrim feet whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness.
America, America, God mend thy every flaw, confirm thy soul in self control, the liberty in law.
O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears.
America, America, God shed His grace on thee, and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea.
The American dream was compounded of many strains.
Some were clearly of Christian origin, among them the Great Awakening and other revivals which helped to make Christian liberty, Christian equality, and Christian fraternity the passion of the land.
Some have seen revivalism and the search for Christian perfection as the fountain-head of the American hope.
Here, too, must be placed Unitarianism and, less obviously from Christian inspiration, Emerson, Transcendentalism, and the idealism of Walt Whitman.
We must also remember those who reacted against the dream as a kind of myth -- among them Melville, Hawthorne, and Henry James the elder, all of them out of a Christian background.
Reform movements with such a dream arising, at least in part, from the Protestant heritage of the United States and built into the foundations of the nation, it is not surprising that many efforts were made to give it concrete expression.
A number were in the nature of movements to relieve or remove social ills.
Significantly, the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movements, especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century, came from men and women of New England birth or parentage and from either Trinitarian or Unitarian Congregationalism.
Several of the movements were given a marked impetus by revivalism.
Quakers, some from New England, had a larger share than their proportionate numerical strength would have warranted.
We do well to remind ourselves that from men and women of New England ancestry also issued the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the Seventh Day Adventists, Christian Science, the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the American Home Missionary Society, the American Bible Society, and New England theology.
The atmosphere was one of optimism, of confidence in human progress, and of a determination to rid the world of its ills.
The Hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence, although holding to original sin and the doctrine of election, inspired its adherents to heroic endeavours for others, looked for the early coming of the Millennium, and was paralleled by the confidence in man's ability cherished by the Unitarians, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists.
We should recall the number of movements for the service of mankind which arose from the kindred Evangelicalism of the British Isles and the Pietism of the Continent of Europe -- among them prison reform, anti-slavery measures, legislation for the alleviation of conditions of labour, the Inner Mission, and the Red Cross.
We cannot take the space to record all the efforts for the removal or alleviation of collective ills.
A few of the more prominent must serve as examples of what a complete listing and description would disclose.
Several were born in the early decades and persisted throughout the century.
Others were ephemeral.
Some disappeared with the attainment of their purpose.
Still others sprang up late in the century to meet conditions which arose from fresh stages of the revolutionary age.
The anti-slavery movement the movement to end Negro slavery began before 1815 and mounted after that year until, as a result of the Civil War, emancipation was achieved.
Long before 1815 the Christian conscience was leading some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly.
For example, in 1693 the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting of Friends declared that its members should emancipate their slaves and in 1776 it determined to exclude from membership all who did not comply.
In the latter year Samuel Hopkins, from whom the Hopkinsian strain of New England theology took its name, asked the Continental Congress to abolish slavery.
As we have seen, Methodism early took a stand against slavery.
Beginning at least as far back as 1789 various Baptist bodies condemned slavery.
After 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mounted, chiefly among Protestants and those of Protestant background of the older stock.
The nineteenth-century immigration, whether Protestant or Roman Catholic, was not so much concerned, for very few if any among them held slaves : they were mostly in the Northern states where slavery had disappeared or was on the way out, or were too poverty-stricken to own slaves.
The anti-slavery movement took many forms.
Benjamin Lundy ( 1789-1839 ), a Quaker, was a pioneer in preparing the way for anti-slavery societies.
It was he who turned the attention of William Lloyd Garrison ( 1805-1879 ) to the subject.
Garrison, Massachusetts born of Nova Scotian parentage, was by temperament and conviction a reformer.
Chiefly remembered because of his incessant advocacy of immediate and unconditional abolition, he also espoused a great variety of other causes -- among them women's rights, prohibition, and justice to the Indians.
Incurably optimistic, dogmatic, and utterly fearless, in his youth a devout Baptist, in spite of his friendship for the Quaker poet John Greenleaf Whittier ( 1807-1892 ) he eventually attacked the orthodox churches for what he deemed their cowardly compromising on the slavery issue and in his invariably ardent manner was emphatically unorthodox and denied the plenary inspiration of the Bible.
A marked impulse came to the anti-slavery movement through the Finney revivals.
Finney himself, while opposed to slavery, placed his chief emphasis on evangelism, but from his converts issued much of the leadership of the anti-slavery campaign.
Theodore Dwight Weld ( 1803-1895 ) was especially active.
Weld was the son and grandson of New England Congregational ministers.
As a youth he became one of Finney's band of evangelists and gave himself to winning young men.
A strong temperance advocate, through the influence of a favorite teacher, Charles Stewart, another Finney convert, he devoted himself to the anti-slavery cause.
A group of young men influenced by him enrolled in Lane Theological Seminary and had to leave because of their open anti-slavery position.
The majority then went to the infant Oberlin.
They and others employed some of Finney's techniques as they sought to win adherents to the cause.
Weld contributed to the anti-slavery convictions of such men as Joshua R. Giddings and Edwin M. Stanton, enlisted John Quincy Adams, and helped provide ideas which underlay Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin.
He shunned publicity for himself and sought to avoid fame.
Wendell Phillips ( 1811-1884 ), from a prominent Massachusetts family, in his teens was converted under the preaching of Lyman Beecher.
Although he later broke with the churches because he believed that they were insufficiently outspoken against social evils, he remained a devout Christian.
He was remembered chiefly for his fearless advocacy of abolition, but he also stood for equal rights for women, for opportunity for the freedmen, and for prohibition.
The anti-slavery movement and other contemporary reforms and philanthropies were given leadership and financial undergirding by Arthur Tappan ( 1786-1865 ) and his younger brother, Lewis Tappan ( 1788-1873 ).
Individuals possessing unusual gifts and great personal power were transmuted at death into awesome spirits ; they were almost immediately worshipped for these newer, even more terrible abilities.
Their direct descendants inherited not only their worldly fortunes, but also the mandate of their newfound power as spirits in the other half of the universe.
Royal lineages could be based on extraordinary worldly achievements translated into eternal otherworldly power.
Thus, the emperor could draw on sources not available to those with less puissant ancestors.
But this eminence was not without its weighty responsibilities.
Since he possessed more power in an interdependent universe of living beings and dead spirits, the emperor had to use it for the benefit of the living.
The royal ritual generated power into the other world : it also provided the living with a way to control the spirits, and bring their powers directly to bear on the everyday affairs of the world.
Proper ritual observance at any level of society was capable of generating power for use in the spirit world ; but naturally, the royal ritual, which provided unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirits, was held responsible for regulating the universe and insuring the welfare of the kingdom.
This is the familiar system of cosmic government.
The Chinese emperor, by proper observance of ritual, manifested divine powers.
He regulated the dualities of light and darkness, Yang and Yin, which are locked in eternal struggle.
By swaying the balance between them, he effected the alternation of the seasons.
His power was so great that he even promoted and demoted gods according to whether they had given ear or been deaf to petitions.
In this system, no man is exempt from obligations.
Failure in daily moral and ethical duties to one's family, outrages to community propriety, any departure from rigid standards of moral excellence were offenses against the dead.
And to offend the dead meant to incur their wrath, and thus provoke the unleashing of countrywide disasters.
The family home was, in fact, a temple ; and the daily duties of individuals were basically religious in nature.
The dead spirits occupied a prominent place in every hope and in every fear.
The common belief was that there existed one moral order, which included everything.
The dead controlled the material prosperity of the living, and the living adhered to strict codes of conduct in order not to weaken that control.
Men believed they could control nature by obeying a moral code.
If the moral code were flouted, the proper balance of the universe would be upset, and the disastrous result could be floods, plague, or famine.
Modern Westerners have difficulty comprehending this fusion of moral and material, largely because in the West the historical trend has been to deny the connection.
Living in urban conditions, away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constrictions of a thatched-roof world view, the individual may find it possible, say, to commit adultery not only without personal misgivings, but also without suffering any adverse effects in his worldly fortunes.
Basing action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provides a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart -- plus the added liberation from the constraint of silent burial urns.
In China, the magical system par excellence was Taoism.
The Taoists were Quietist mystics, who saw an unchanging unity -- the Tao -- underlying all phenomena.
It was this timeless unity that was all-important, and not its temporary manifestations in the world of reality.
The Taoists believed the unity could be influenced by proper magical manipulation ; in other words, they were actually an organization of magicians.
Mahayana Buddhism was no exception to these prevailing magical concepts.
After this form of Indian Buddhism had been introduced into China, it underwent extensive changes.
During its flowering in the sixth to the eighth centuries, Mahayana offered a supernatural package to the Chinese which bears no resemblance to the highly digested philosophical Zen morsels offered to the modern Western reader.
Mahayana had gods, and magic, a pantheon, heavens and hells, and gorgeously appareled priests, monks, and nuns, all of whom wielded power over souls in the other world.
The self-realized Mahayana saint possessed superhuman powers and magic.
The Mahayana that developed in the north was a religion of idolatry and coarse magic, that made the world into a huge magical garden.
In its monastic form, Mahayana was merely an organization of magic-practicing monks ( bonzes, ) who catered to the Chinese faith in the supernatural.
Nonmagical Confucianism was a secular, rational philosophy, but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government.
Confucianism had its own magic in the idea that virtue had power.
If a man lived a classical life, he need not fear the spirits -- for only lack of virtue gave the spirits power over him.
But let us not be mistaken about Confucian virtue ; this was not virtue as we understand the word today, and it did not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation.
To the Confucian, virtue simply meant mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rules of ritual and three thousand minor ones.
Propriety was synonymous with ritual observance, the mark of a true gentleman.
To live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of living and dead was decisive for man's fate.
This, in brief, was the historical background out of which Zen emerged.
Promoters of Zen to the West record its ancestry, and recognize that Zen grew out of a combination of Taoism and Indian Mahayana Buddhism.
But the marvelous person that is supposed to result from Zen exhibits more Chinese practicality than Indian speculation -- he possesses magical powers, and can use them to order nature and to redeem souls.
Proponents of Zen to the West emphasize disproportionately the amount of Mahayana Buddhism in Zen, probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical Taoist ideas with more respectable Buddhist metaphysic.
But in the Chinese mind, there was little difference between the two -- the bonzes were no more metaphysical than a magician has to be.
Actually, Zen owes more to Chinese Quietism than it does to Mahayana Buddhism.
The Ch'an ( Zen ) sect may have derived its metaphysic from Mahayana, but its psychology was pure early Taoist.
This is well evidenced by the Quietist doctrines carried over in Zen : the idea of the inward turning of thought, the enjoinder to put aside desires and perturbations so that a return to purity, peace, and stillness -- a union with the Infinite, with the Tao -- could be effected.
In fact, the antipathy to outward ceremonies hailed by modern exponents as so uniquely characteristic of the direct thinking Zennist was a feature of Taoism.
So, too, was the insistence on the relativity of the external world, and the ideas that language and things perceived by consciousness were poor substitutes indeed for immediate perception by pure, indwelling spirit : the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness.
Zen maintains that cognitive things are only the surface of experience.
One of its features attractive to the West is its irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred texts.
One patriarch is supposed to have relegated sacred scriptures for use in an outhouse.
But this is not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the Westerner mistakes it.
It is simply that in Taoist tradition -- as in all good mysticisms -- books, words, or any other manifestations that belong to the normal state of consciousness are considered only the surface of experience.
The truth -- the Eternal Truth -- is not transmittable by words.
Reality is considered not only irrelevant to the acquisition of higher knowledge, but a positive handicap.
The technique of reality confusion -- the use of paradox and riddles to shake the mind's grip on reality -- originated with fourth and third century B.*c. Chinese Quietism : the koan is not basically a new device.
It is important for an understanding of Zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupations of the select few cannot be the doctrine of the common man.
In the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government, only the ruling elite was ever concerned with a kingdom-wide ordering of nature : popular religion aimed at more personal benefits from magical powers.
And this is only natural -- witness the haste with which modern man gobbles the latest wonder drug.
Early Chinese anchoritism was theoretically aimed at a mystic pantheist union with the divine, personal salvation being achieved when the mystical recluse united with divine essence.
But this esoteric doctrine was lost in the shuffle to acquire special powers.
The anchorite strove, in fact, to magically influence the world of spirits in the same way that the divine emperor manifested his power.
Thus, the Mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation was distilled down to a bare self-seeking, and for this reason, the mystic in Asia did not long remain in isolated contemplation.
As the Zen literature reveals, as soon as an early Zen master attained fame in seclusion, he was called out into the world to exercise his powers.
The early Anchorite masters attracted disciples because of their presumed ability to perform miracles.
Exponents of Zen often insist that very early Zen doctrine opposed the rampant supernaturalism of China, and proposed instead a more mature, less credulous view of the universe.
In support of this, stories from the early literature are cited to show that Zen attacks the idea of supernatural power.
But actually these accounts reveal the supernatural powers that the masters were in fact supposed to possess, as well as the extreme degree of popular credulity : Hwang Pah ( O Baku ), one day going up Mount Tien Tai which was believed to have been inhabited by Arhats with supernatural powers, met with a monk whose eyes emitted strange light.
They went along the pass talking with each other for a short while until they came to a river roaring with torrent.
There being no bridge, the master had to stop at the shore ; but his companion crossed the river walking on the water and beckoned to Hwang Pah to follow him.
Thereupon Hwang Pah said : if I knew thou art an Arhat, I would have doubled you up before thou got over there ] the monk then understood the spiritual attainment of Hwang Pah, and praised him as a true Mahayanist.
( 1 ) a second tale shows still more clearly the kind of powers a truly spiritual monk could possess : on one occasion Yang Shan ( Kyo-zan ) saw a stranger monk flying through the air.
When that monk came down and approached him with a respectful salutation, he asked : where art thou from?
Early this morning, replied the other, I set out from India.
Why, said the teacher, art thou so late?
I stopped, responded the man, several times to look at beautiful sceneries.
Thou mayst have supernatural powers, exclaimed Yang Shan, yet thou must give back the Spirit of Buddha to me.
Then the monk praised Yang Shan saying : I have come over to China in order to worship Manjucri, and met unexpectedly with Minor Shakya, and after giving the master some palm leaves he brought from India, went back through the air.
( 2 ) in the popular Chinese mind, Ch'an ( Zen ) was no exception to the ideas of coarse magic that dominated.
A closer look at modern Zen reveals many magical carryovers that are still part of popular Zen attitudes.
To the Zen monk the universe is still populated with spiritual beings who have to be appeased.
Part of the mealtime ritual in the Zendo consists in offerings of rice to the spiritual beings.
Modern Zen presentation to the West insists on the anti-authoritarian, highly pragmatic nature of the Zen belief -- scriptures are burned to make fire, action is based on direct self-confidence, and so on.
This picture of extreme self-reliant individuation is difficult to reconcile with such Zendo formulas as : o you, demons and other spiritual beings, I now offer this to you, and may this food fill up the ten quarters of the world and all the demons and other spiritual beings be fed therewith.
( 3 ) Pope Leo 13, on the 13th day of December 1898, granted the following indulgences : an indulgence of three hundred days is granted to all the Faithful who read the Holy Gospels at least a quarter of an hour.
A Plenary Indulgence under the usual conditions is granted once a month for the daily reading.
Pope Pius the Sixth, at Rome, in April, 1778, wrote the following : the faithful should be excited to the reading of the Holy Scriptures : for these are the most abundant sources which ought to be left open to everyone, to draw from them purity of morals and of doctrine, to eradicate errors which are so widely disseminated in these corrupt times.
The American Bishops assembled at the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore urged the Catholic people to read the Holy Bible.
We hope, they said, that no family can be found amongst us without a correct version of the Holy Scriptures.
They recommended, also, that at a fixed hour, let the entire family be assembled for night prayers, followed by a short reading of the Holy Scriptures.
Since the Catholic Church expresses such desire that the Sacred Scriptures be read, the following taken from the Holy Bible ( New Catholic Edition ) will prove a means of grace and a source of great spiritual blessing.

A final word you may be very religious, a church member, an upright, honest and sincere person ; you may be baptized, confirmed, reverent and worshipful ; you may attend mass, do penance, say prayers and zealously keep all the sacraments and ceremonies of the church ; you may have the final and extreme unction but if you are not born again you are lost and headed for hell and eternal punishment.

Being convinced that salvation is alone by accepting Christ as Saviour, and being convicted by the Holy Spirit of my lost condition, I do repent of all effort to be saved by any form of good works, and just now receive Jesus as my personal Saviour and salvation as a free gift from Him.
You may do as you please with God now.
It is permitted.
God placed Himself in men's hands when He sent Jesus Christ into the world as perfect God and perfect Man in one Being.
He was then in man's hands.
They cursed Him.
It was permitted.
Men spit on Him.
God allowed it.
They called Him a devil.
God withheld His wrath.
Finally men arrested Him, gave Him a mock trial, flogged Him, nailed Him on a cross and hung Him between earth and heaven ; and God allowed it.
You can do likewise though Christ is not bodily present.
You can ignore Him.
You can ignore His Book, the Bible, and His church.
You can laugh at His blood-bought salvation, curse His followers, and laugh at hell.
It is permitted.
The eternal Christ may knock at your soul's door, calling you to give up sin and prepare for heaven.
You may refuse Him, spit on Him, call Him a devil, curse Him.
It is permitted.
You may take His name upon your lips in oaths and curses if you so choose.
He is in your hands -- now.
On the other hand, you may seek His favor, humble yourself before Him and beg His mercy, implore His forgiveness, forsake your sins, and abandon your whole life to Him.
He has said, behold, I stand at the door, and knock : if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me ( Revelation 3:20 : 20 ).
The choice is up to you.
The latch is on your side of the door.
The choice is yours : the revellings and banquetings of this world or quiet communion with God ; the ever burning lusts of the flesh or the powerful victory of Holy Spirit discipline.
The choice is yours : God is in your hands, now.
God has already set the day when you will be in His hands.
What He does with you then depends on what you do with Him now.
Then it will be a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God if you have abused Him in your hands.
I am a magazine ; my name is Guideposts ; this issue that you are reading marks my 15th anniversary.
When I came into being, 15 years ago, I had one primary purpose : to help men and women everywhere to know God better, and through knowing Him better to become happier and more effective people.
That purpose has never changed.
When you read me, you are holding in your hands the product of many minds and hearts.
Some of the people who speak through my pages are famous ; others unknown.
Some work with their hands.
Some have walked through pain and sorrow to bring you their message of hope.
Some are so filled with gratitude, for the gift of life and the love of God, that their joy spills out on the paper and brightens the lives of thousands whom they have never known, and will never see.
Fifteen years ago, there were no Guideposts at all.
This month a million Guideposts will circulate all over the world.
Experts in the publishing field consider this astounding.
They do not understand how a small magazine with no advertising and no newsstand sale could have achieved such a following.
To me, the explanation is very simple.
I am not doing anything, of myself.
I am merely a channel for something.
What is this something?
I cannot define it fully.
It is the force in the universe that makes men love goodness, even when they turn away from it.
It is the power that holds the stars in their orbits, but allows the wind to bend a blade of grass.
It is the whisper in the heart that urges each one to be better than he is.
It is mankind's wistful yearning for a world of justice and peace.
All things are possible to God, but He chooses -- usually -- to work through people.
Sometimes such people sense that they are being used ; sometimes not.
Fifteen years ago, troubled by the rising tide of materialism in the post-war world, a businessman and a minister asked themselves if there might not be a place for a small magazine in which men and women, regardless of creed or color, could set forth boldly their religious convictions and bear witness to the power of faith to solve the endless problems of living.
The businessman was Raymond Thornburg.
The minister was Norman Vincent Peale.
Neither had any publishing experience, but they had faith in their idea.
They borrowed a typewriter, raised about $2,000 in contributions, hired a secretary, persuaded a couple of young men to join them for almost no pay and began mailing out a collection of unstapled leaflets that they called Guideposts.
Compared to the big, established magazines, my first efforts seemed feeble indeed.
But from the start they had two important ingredients : sincerity and realism.
The people who told the stories were sincere.
And the stories they told were true.
For example, early in my life, when one of my editorial workers wanted to find out how churches and philanthropic organizations met the needs of New York's down-and-outers, he didn't just ask questions.
Len Le*sourd went and lived in the slums as a sidewalk derelict for ten days.
That was nearly 13 years ago.
Len Le*sourd is my executive editor today.
Many of you are familiar, I'm sure, with the story of my early struggles : the fire in January, 1947, that destroyed everything -- even our precious list of subscribers.
The help and sympathy that were forthcoming from everywhere.
The crisis later on when debts seemed about to overwhelm me.
That was when a remarkable woman, Teresa Durlach, came to my aid -- not so much with money, as with wisdom and courage.
You're not living up to your own principles, she told my discouraged people.
You're so preoccupied that you've let your faith grow dim.
What do you want -- a hundred thousand subscribers?
Visualize them, then, believe you are getting them, and you will have them ] and the 100,000 subscribers became a reality.
And then 500,000.
And now a million January Guideposts are in circulation.
With our growth came expansion into new fields of service.
Today more than a thousand industries distribute me to their employees.
They say all personnel have spiritual needs which Guideposts helps to meet.
Hundreds of civic clubs, business firms and individuals make me available to school teachers throughout the land.
They say it helps them bring back into schools the spiritual and moral values on which this country was built.
Thousands of free copies are sent each month to chaplains in the Armed Forces, to prison libraries and to hospitals everywhere.
Bedridden people say I am easy to hold -- and read.
Three years ago it became possible to finance a Braille edition for blind readers.
Throughout these exciting years I have been fortunate for, although I have never offered great financial inducements, talent has found its way to me : William Boal who so ably organizes business operations ; John Beach who guides circulation ; Irving Granville and Nelson Rector who travel widely calling on business firms.
Searching for the best in spiritual stories, my roving editors cover not only the country, but the whole world.
Glenn Kittler has been twice to Africa, once spending a week with Dr. Albert Schweitzer.
Last summer John and Elizabeth Sherrill were in Alaska.
Van Varner recently returned from Russia.
Twice a month the editorial staff meets in New York for an early supper, then a long evening of idea-exchange.
Around the table sit Protestant, Catholic, and Jew.
Each contributes something different, and something important : Ruth Peale, her wide experience in church work ; Sidney Fields, years of experience as a New York columnist ; Catherine Marshall Le*sourd, the insight that has made her books world-famous and Norm Mullendore, the keen perception of an advertising executive.
There are people who travel long distances to assure my continued existence.
Elaine St. Johns may fly in from the West Coast for the editorial staff meetings.
Starr Jones gets up every morning at five o'clock, milks his family cow, attends to farm chores, and then takes a two-hour train trip to New York.
Arthur Gordon comes once a month all the way from Georgia.
We have also seen the power of faith at work among us.
Rose Weiss, who handles all the prayer-requests that we receive, answering each letter personally, has the serene selflessness that comes from suffering : she has had many major operations, and now gets about in a limited way on braces and crutches.
Recently, John Sherrill was stricken with one of the deadliest forms of cancer.
We prayed for John, during surgery, we asked others to pray ; all over the country a massive shield of prayer was thrown around him.
Today the cancer is gone.
Perhaps it is not fair to mention some people without mentioning all.
But, you see, those who are not mentioned will not resent it.
That is the kind of people they are.
Perhaps you think the editorial meetings are solemn affairs, a little sanctimonious?
Not so.
Serious, yes, but also much laughter.
Sharp division of opinion, too, and strenuous debate.
There are brain-wracking searches for the right word, the best phrase, the most helpful idea.
And there is also something intangible that hovers around the table.
A good word for it is fellowship.
A shorter word is.
Each meeting starts with a prayer, offered love spontaneously by one member of the group.
It takes many forms, this prayer, but in essence it is always a request for guidance, for open minds and gentle hearts, for honesty and sincerity, for the wisdom and the insights that will help Guideposts' readers.
For you, readers, are an all-important part of the spiritual experiment that is Guideposts.
I need your support, your criticism, your encouragement, your prayers.
I am a magazine ; my name is Guideposts.
My message, today, is the same as it was 15 years ago : that there is goodness in people, and strength and love in God.
May He bless you all.
Havana was filled with an excitement which you could see in the brightness of men's eyes and hear in the pitch of their voices.
The hated dictator Batista had fled.
Rumors flew from lip to lip that Fidel Castro was on his way to Havana, coming from the mountains where he had fought Batista for five years.
Already the city was filled with Barbudos, the bearded, war-dirty Revolutionaries, carrying carbines, waving to the crowds that lined the Prado.
And then Castro himself did come, bearded, smiling ; yet if you looked closely you'd see that his eyes did not pick up the smile on his lips.
At first I was happy to throw the support of our newspaper behind this man.
I am sure that Castro was happy, too, about that support.
Diario De La Marina was the oldest and most influential paper in Cuba, with a reputation for speaking out against tyranny.
My grandfather had been stoned because of his editorials.
My own earliest memories are of exiles : my three brothers and I were taken often to the United States to visit relatives while my father stayed on to fight the dictator Machado.
When it was my turn, I, too, printed the truth as I knew it about Batista, and rejoiced to see his regime topple.
None of us was aware that the biggest fight was still ahead.
I was full of hope as Fidel Castro came into Havana.
Within a week, however, I began to suspect that something was wrong.
For Castro was bringing Cuba not freedom, but hatred.
He spent long hours before the *j spitting out promises of revenge.
He showed us how he dealt with his enemies : he executed them before *j cameras.
On home sets children were watching the death throes of men who were shot before the paredon, the firing wall.
Castro's reforms?
He seemed bent on coupling them with vengeance.
New schools were rising, but with this went a harsh proclamation : any academic degree earned during Batista's regime was invalid.
Economic aid?
He had promised cheaper housing : arbitrarily he cut all rents in half, whether the landlord was a millionaire speculator or a widow whose only income was the rental of a spare room.
Under another law, hundreds of farms were seized.
Farm workers had their wages cut almost in half.
Of this, only 50 cents a day was paid in cash, the rest in script usable only in People's Stores.
A suspicion was growing that Fidel Castro was a Communist.
In my mind, I began to review : his use of hate to gain support ; his People's Courts ; his division of society into two classes, one the hero, the other the villain.
But most disturbing of all were the advisers he called to sit with him in the Palace ; many came from Communist countries.
What should I do about it, I asked myself?
I had watched Castro handling his enemies before the paredon.
There was no doubt in my mind that if I crossed him, mobs would appear outside our windows shouting paredon ] paredon ] what should I do?
I was proud of the new buildings which housed Diario now : the rotogravures, gleaming behind glass doors ; the thump and whir of our new presses.
Here was a powerful, ready-made medium, but it could speak only if I told it to.
Then one day, early in January, 1960, I sat down at my desk, and suddenly I was aware of the crucifix.
It was a simple ivory crucifix which my mother had given me.
I had mounted it on velvet and hung it over my desk to remind me always to use the power of the paper in a Christian manner.
Now it seemed almost as if Jesus were looking down at me with sadness in His eyes, saying : you will lose the paper.
You may lose your life.
But do in that you have any choice?
I knew moment that I did not have any choice.
From that day on I began to write editorials about the things I did not think correct in Fidel Castro's regime.
Too often a beginning bodybuilder has to do his training secretly either because his parents don't want sonny-boy to lift all those old barbell things because you'll stunt your growth or because childish taunts from his schoolmates, like hey lookit Mr. America ; whaddya gonna do with all those muscles ( of which he has none at the time )?
After all, a guy's gotta have a little ego ] therefore it's a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who has never had to train in secret has never heard one unkind word from his parents and never has been taunted by his schoolmates ] this happy, always smiling lad with the sunny disposition is our new Junior Mr. Canada -- Henri De Courcy.
Far from discouraging Henri, his parents urge him on to greater and greater accomplishments.
Instead of admonishing him to let the weights alone they personally took him to that master Montreal bodybuilding authority, Professor Roland Claude.
And they couldn't have entrusted Henri to better hands because le professeur knows his muscles from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and better still, he knows just what exercises work best for them and what Weider principles to combine them with for fast, fast muscle growth.
That's because the good professor teaches only Weider methods at his famous Montreal Health Studio which is located at 1821 Mt. Royal East in Montreal.
Undoubtedly you have read the case histories of some of his prize-winning pupils ( every pupil has a physique title of some kind or other ).
There's Gaetan D'*amours who is our newest Mr. Canada ; Jean-*paul Senesac, whose story appeared here two issues ago ; Jack Boissoneault, who was with us last month ; Charles Harve, who recently won the Most Muscular Man subdivision award in the Mr. Canada event ; and a host of others.
Yesiree, the professor knows his muscles ] now when Henri was just 12 he was only 4' 10'' tall and weighed an astounding 72 pounds, and his greatest desire was to pack on some weight.
About that time he began reading Mr. America and Muscle Builder and he learned of the famous Weider way to fast weight gaining.
Seeing so many illustrations and reading so many testimonials to the value of Quick-*wate and Super-*protein, those two wonder-working Weider food supplements, he decided to try them and see what they could do for him.
Well, sir they did real great ] for in almost less time than it takes to tell it, Henri's bodyweight was increasing rapidly.
Of course he did some exercising.
He's crazy about water skiing and swimming and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the added food supplements packed pounds of solid muscle on his skinny frame.
Henri has always had shapely legs from swimming and water skiing and really doesn't have to work them very much.
But he was totally dissatisfied with his upper body.
It was muscular but it wasn't symmetrical.
A real nothing torso, says Henri.
It never seemed to widen.
It just got longer and longer.
That's when he went to Professor Claude.
And at once Claude saw what the trouble was and he knew just how to correct it.
In his gym the professor has some of the most knocked out equipment since Vic Tanny.
Mr. Claude is a specialist in torso development and he has long favored the now-famous Weider Push-*pull Super-*set technique in which one exercise of the Super-*set is a pressing or pushing movement which accents one sector of a muscle group in a specific way, followed by a pulling exercise which works the opposing sector of the same muscle group.
So right away Claude introduced Henri to his famous moon bench and proceeded to teach him his first Push-*pull Super-*set consisting of the wide-grip Straight-*arm Pullover ( the pull part of the Push-*pull Super-*set ) which dramatically widens the ribcage and strongly affects the muscles of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar Bench Press which specifically works on the chest to build those wide, Reeves-type gladiator *j, while stimulating the upper *j and frontal deltoids.
As you can see, in this Push-*pull Super Set the entire chest-back-shoulder area is vigorously exercised in alternate sectors by alternate exercises so the complete torso remains pumped-up all the time ] now when Henri has completed four complete Push-*pull Super-*sets No. 1, the professor allows him about a five-minute rest period before starting him on four complete Push-*pull Super-*sets No. 2.
Super-*set No. 2 is made up of similar exercises, but this time done with dumbbells, and using both moon and flat benches.
The push exercise of this Push-*pull Super-*set is the Bench Press done with elbows well pulled back and with a greater downward stretch of the pectorals not possible with the barbell variation.
You need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the *j.
The dumbbell variation develops a most classically sculptured outline to the *j.
The pull exercise in this Super-*set is the one-dumbbell Bent-*arm Pullover.
( note how strongly the upper *j and serratus are worked in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation affords ).
In the third Push-*pull Super-*set the push exercise is the widegrip Pushup Between Bars, while the pull exercise is the Moon Bench Lateral Raise with bent arms.
The Pushup done in this manner is the greatest pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invented ] this is true only if a very wide grip is used and only when the greatest possible stretch is achieved.
You'll know when you've made the greatest stretch because your shoulder blades will touch ] as you see, the professor has designed a piece of apparatus that forces the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip.
He has to ; he just can't do anything about it at all ] but as you can also see, it's not a painful exercise at all, because Henri De Courcy -- the happy bodybuilder -- looks as though he were having the time of his life ] the last exercise of Roland Claude's prescribed program for Henri is a single exercise, done in individual sets with a bit longer pause between sets.
By this time Henri's entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area is pumped-up to almost bursting point, and Claude takes time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shaping work.
He has Henri do from four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press ( note the high incline ).
This gives a wide flare to the *j, causing them to flow dramatically upward into deltoids and dramatically downward into the serratus and *j.
This is the kind of chest that invariably wins contests ; that steel-edged carved-out-of-solid rock looks of the great champions.
So with four complete Push-*pull Super-*sets No. 1, four of No. 2, four of No. 3 and four to six sets of the Incline Bench Press, you can see that Henri De Courcy has had a terrific mass-building, muscle-shaping, torso-defining workout that cannot be improved upon.
Physique contests are rarely won on muscle size alone.
Rarer still is a Mr. America or Mr. Universe of true Herculean build.
The aspects of physical development that catch the judges' eyes and which rightfully influence their decisions are symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion -- superior definition of the muscles.
Now good definition is one thing that all of us can acquire with occasional high-set, high-rep, light-weight workouts.
But contest definition -- that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seems as though it must have been carved by a sculptor's chisel -- is something quite different.
This comes not alone from high-set, high-rep training, but from certain definition-specialization exercises which the champion selects for himself with the knowledge of exactly what works best for him.
Often these exercises work well for some bodybuilders but less spectacularly for others.
Because they are minority exercises and have but a limited appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forgotten.
Only when the newest Mr. America or Mr. Universe discovers them and puts them into practice are we reacquainted with them and once again see how effective they really are.
The exercise I shall discuss in this -- the first of a new series of articles on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part -- is the One Leg Lunge.
Why it was ever forgotten for even a moment I cannot say because it works perfectly for everyone, no matter whether he has short or long thigh-bone lengths ] it is the one exercise that drastically influences the definition of the thighs at the hipline -- that mark of the champion that sets him apart from all other bodybuilders ; a criterion of muscle drama that is unforgettable to judges and audiences alike ; the facet of muscular development that wins prizes.
Definition of the thighs at the uppermost part is quite commonly seen in most championship Olympic lifters which is easily understandable.
The One Leg Lunge is a split and all lifters practice this in their regular workouts.
But for purely definition purposes -- used in conjunction with your regular Squatting, Leg Curling, Leg Extensor programs -- a heavy weight is not needed.
Indeed, a lighter weight works much better because a greater, more extensive split can be performed.
Used in several sets of high reps once or twice each week it will not be long before your entire upper leg takes on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscles look like wire cables writhing and twisting under the skin ] really there is no reason why this fine exercise should not find its way into your leg program at all times, for the following suggestions show why it is so effective : 1.
It's a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise.
2.
It places terrific tension on the leg muscles from start to finish of each repetition.
3.
It improves over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder, and helps to make Squats more easily and more correctly performed.
4.
It increases flexibility of the legs.
5.
It speeds muscle growth and power development even for the advanced bodybuilder because each hip and leg is exercised separately, thus enabling a massive, concentrated effort to be focused on each.
You'll need your Weider Power Stands for this fine exercise and here's the way it's done : 1.
Place your Power Stands in position and adjust their height so that this will correspond to the height of your shoulders when you are in a deep leg split as for a heavy Clean.
2.
Place a suitably-loaded barbell across them ; grasp the bar ( which will rest against the back of your neck ) ; extend your feet forward and backward until you are in a deep leg split.
Now raise the weight by straightening your front leg, without moving your feet.
When the front knee is straight and locked, allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the sides of the Power Stands.
3.
After you have taken a breather, reverse the position of your legs so that the front thigh of the previous exercise is now to the rear, and the rear thigh now to the front, and perform the same movement in the same manner.
That's the One-*leg Lunge in a nutshell.
You should have a couple of training partners to stand by when you make your first experiments just for safety.
You should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustomed to it balance-wise.
Oh, you'll wobble and weave quite a bit at first.
But don't worry.
Before your first training experiment has ended there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you'll be raising and lowering yourself just like a veteran ] although I suggested that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there's no reason why you shouldn't make some experiments with the bar held in front of the neck.
Squat-style lifters and leg-split lifters would both benefit enormously by practicing those variations providing that they remember to make alternate sets with the left and right leg to the front.
The most beautiful bed of pansies I've seen was in a South Dakota yard on a sizzling day.
Pansies are supposed to like it cool, but those great velvety flowers were healthy and perky in the glaring sun.
I sought out the gardener and asked him what he did to produce such beauties in that weather.
He seemed puzzled by my question.
I just love them, he said.
The more I talked with him, the more convinced I became that that was the secret of their riotous blooming.
Of course his love was expressed in intelligent care.
He planted the pansy seeds himself, buying them from a pansy specialist.
These specialists, I learned, have done a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plants and the resulting flowers.
Their seeds produce vigorous blooming plants half again the size of the unimproved strains.
I asked him if he took seeds from his own plants.
Occasionally, when he had an unusual flower that he wanted more of he did ; but pansy seeds, he told me, soon run down.
It's best to buy them fresh from a dealer who is working to improve them.
His soil was nothing special, just prairie land, but he had harrowed in compost until it was loose, spongy and brown-black.
I fingered it and had the feeling of adequacy that comes with the right texture, tilth and body.
It isn't easy to describe it, but every gardener knows it when his fingers touch such soil.
Nothing is easier to grow from seed than pansies.
They germinate quickly, the tiny plants appearing in a week, and grow along lustily.
It doesn't really matter which month of the year you sow them, but they germinate best when they have a wide variation of temperature, very warm followed by cool in the same 24 hours.
I like to make a seedbed right in the open, though many people start them successfully in cold frames.
Pansies don't have to be coddled ; they'd rather have things rugged, with only moderate protection on the coldest days.
If you do use a cold frame be sure that its ventilation is adequate.
For my seedbed I use good garden soil with a little sand added to encourage rooting.
I dig it, rake it smooth, sow the seeds and wet them down with a fog spray.
Then I cover the sowing with a board.
This keeps it cool and moist and protects it from birds.
Ants carry away the seeds so better be sure that there are no ant hills nearby.
When the first sprinkling of green appears I remove the board.
A light, porous mulch applied now keeps the roots cool and the soil soft during these early days of growth.
I like sawdust for this, or hay.
When they have 4 to 6 leaves and are thrifty little plants, it's time to set them out where they are to remain.
Every time you transplant a pansy you cause its flowers to become smaller.
The moral is : don't transplant it any oftener than you must.
As soon as they are large enough to move, I put mine 9 inches apart where they are to bloom.
I put a little scoop of pulverized phosphate rock or steamed bone meal into each hole with the plant.
That encourages rooting, and the better developed the roots, the larger and more plentiful the flowers.
Pansies are gluttons.
I doubt if it is possible to overfeed them.
I spade lots of compost into their bed ; lacking that, decayed manure spread over the bed is fine.
One year I simply set the plants in the remains of a compost pile, to which a little sand had been added, and I had the most beautiful pansies in my, or any of my neighbors' experience.
In addition to the rich soil they benefit by feedings of manure water every other week, diluted to the color of weak tea.
As a substitute for this, organic fertilizer dissolved in water to half the strength in the directions, may be used.
They need mulch.
We put a light mulch over the seedlings ; now we must use a heavy one.
Three inches of porous material will do a good job of keeping weeds down and the soil moist and cool.
When winter comes be ready with additional mulch.
I like hay for this and apply it so that only the tops of the plants show right after a good frost.
That keeps in the cold, retains moisture and prevents the heaving of alternate freezing and thawing.
Don't miss the pansies that appear from time to time through the winter.
Whenever there is a thaw or a few sunny days, you'll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two.
If those aren't enough for you, why not grow some just for winter blooming?
The pansies I cherished most bloomed for me in February during a particularly cold winter.
I started the seed in a flat in June and set out the little pansies in a cold frame.
( an unheated greenhouse would have been better, if I had had one.
) the plants took zero nights in their stride, with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect them.
In response to the lengthening days of February they budded, then bloomed their 4-inch velvety flowers.
That cold frame was my morale builder ; its mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow made my spirits rise every time I looked at it.
Like strawberries in December, pansies are far more exciting in February than in May.
Try that late winter pickup when you are so tired of cold and snow that you feel you just can't take another day of it.
The day will come, in midsummer, when you find your plants becoming leggy, running to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossoms.
Try pegging down each separate branch to the earth, using a bobby pin to hold it there.
Pick the flowers, keep the soil dampened, and each of the pegged-down branches will take root and become a little plant and go on blooming for the rest of the season.
As soon as an experimental tug assures you that roots have taken over, cut it off from the mother plant.
A second and also good practice is to shear off the tops, leaving an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch.
These cut-down plants will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just as they did in early spring.
I like to shear half my plants at a time, leaving one half of them to blossom while the second half is getting started on its new round of blooming.
Probably no one needs to tell you that the way to stop all bloom is to let the blossoms go to seed.
Nature's aim, different from ours, is to provide for the coming generation.
That done, her work is accomplished and she ignores the plant.
Here is a word of advice when you go shopping for your pansy seeds.
Go to a reputable grower, preferably a pansy specialist.
It is no harder to raise big, healthy, blooming plants than weak, sickly little things ; in fact it is easier.
But you will never get better flowers than the seed you grow.
Many people think that pansies last only a few weeks, then their period of growth and bloom is over.
That is not true.
If the plants are cared for and protected over the winter, the second year is more prolific than the first.
Would you like to grow exhibition pansies?
Remove about half the branches from each plant, leaving only the strongest with the largest buds.
The flowers will be huge.
Pansies have character.
They stick to their principles, insist upon their due, but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if given it.
Treat them right and they'll make a showing every month in the year except the frigid ones.
Give them food, some shade, mulch, water and more food, and they'll repay your solicitude with beauty.
A salad with greens and tomato is a popular and wonderfully healthful addition to a meal, but add an avocado and you have something really special.
This delightful tropical fruit has become well-known in the past thirty years because modern transportation methods have made it possible to ship avocados anywhere in the United States.
It has a great many assets to recommend it and if you haven't made avocado a part of your diet yet, you really should.
You will find that avocado is unlike any other fruit you have ever tasted.
It is roughly shaped like a large pear, and when properly ripened, its dark green skin covers a meaty, melon-like pulp that has about the consistency of a ripe Bartlett pear, but oily.
The avocado should have a give to it, as you hold it, when it is ripe.
The flavor is neither sweet, like a pear, nor tart like an orange ; it is subtle and rather bland, nut-like.
It is a flavor that might take a little getting used to -- not because it is unpleasant, but because the flavor is hard to define in the light of our experience with other fruits.
Sometimes it takes several eatings of avocado to catch that delightful quality in taste that has made it such a favorite throughout the world.
Once you become an avocado fan, you will look forward to the season each year with eager anticipation.
Naturally dormant and no spray danger today, refrigerated carriers have made the shipping of avocados possible to any place in the world.
The fruit is allowed to mature on the tree, but it is still firm at this point.
It is brought to packing houses, cleaned and graded as to size and quality, and packed in protective excelsior.
The fruit is then cooled to 42-degrees-*f., a temperature at which it lapses into a sort of dormant state.
This cooling does not change the avocado in any way, it just delays the natural softening of the fruit until a grovelike temperature ( room temperature ) is restored.
This happens on the grocer's shelf or in your kitchen.
One of the most attractive things about avocados is that they do not require processing of any kind.
There is no dyeing or waxing or gassing needed.
If the temperature is controlled properly, the avocado will delay its ripening until needed.
And unlike other fruits, one cannot eat the skin of the avocado.
It is thick, much like an egg plant's skin, so that poison sprays, if they are used, present no hazard to the consumer.
Nutritious and a cholesterol reducer good taste and versatility, plus safety from spray poisons would be enough to recommend the frequent use of such a fruit, even if its nutritional values were limited.
Avocados, however, are very rich in nutrients.
Their main asset is an abundance of unsaturated fatty acids, so necessary for maintaining the good health of the circulatory system.
Aside from this, the average portion contains some protein, an appreciable amount of vitamins *j and *j -- about one-tenth of the minimum daily requirement, and about a third of the official vitamin *j requirement.
The *j vitamins are well represented, especially thiamin and riboflavin.
Calcium, phosphorus and iron are present in worthwhile amounts, and eleven other minerals also have been found in varying trace amounts.
None of these values is destroyed, not significantly altered by refrigeration storage.
Dr. Wilson C. Grant, of the Veterans' Administration Hospital, Coral Gables, Florida, and the University of Miami School of Medicine, set out to discover if avocados, because of their high content of unsaturated fatty acids, would reduce the cholesterol of the blood in selected patients.
The study comprised 16 male patients, ranging in age from 27 to 72.
They were put on control diets to determine as accurately as possible, the normal cholesterol level of their blood.
Then they were given 1/2 to 1-1/2 avocados per day as a substitute for part of their dietary fat consumption.
Five, four, three, two, one, fire ] the tremendous energy released by giant rocket engines perhaps can be felt much better than it can be heard.
The pulsating vibration of energy clutches at the pit of your stomach.
Never before has the introduction of a weapon caused so much apprehension and fear.
Nuclear weapons are fearsome, but the long-range ballistic missile gives them a stealth and merciless swiftness which is much more terrifying.
A great many writers are bewitched by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he were to strike with complete surprise using nuclear rockets.
It is relatively easy to go a step further and reason that an attacker, in possession of such absolute power, would simultaneously destroy his opponent's cities and people.
With a nation defenseless before it, why would the attacker spare the victim's people?
Wouldn't the wanton destruction of cities and people be the logical act of complete subjugation?
The nation would be utterly devastated.
The will of its people, so crucial in time of peril, would be broken.
Nuclear weapons have given the world the means for self-destruction in hours or days ; and now rockets have given it the means to destroy itself in minutes.
At this point it should be painfully obvious that cities, being soft, and the people within them are ideally suited to destruction by nuclear weapons.
However, because this vulnerability is mutual, it is to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent's cities, at least so long as the opponent has nuclear weapons with which to effect reprisal.
It should be appallingly apparent that city-trading is not a profitable military tactic.
I*c*b*ms have given us a capability which could be used in two different ways.
They could be used to attack a nation's people ( which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker's own people ), or they could be used with discrimination to destroy the enemy's military force.
If our national interest lies in being able to fight and win a war rather than committing national suicide, then we must take a much more penetrating look at ballistic missiles.
We must determine whether missiles can win a war all by themselves.
We must make certain that the aircraft is finished before we give the entire job to the missile.
Missiles are very valuable weapons, but they also have their too little known limitations.
Because of a missile's ballistic trajectory, the location of a fixed target must be known quite accurately.
Placing missiles in submarines, on barges, railroads, highways, surface vessels and in the air provides them with passive protection by taking advantage of the gravest weakness of long-range ballistic missiles today -- the extreme difficulty of destroying a mobile or moving target with such weapons.
One must first detect a fleeting mobile or moving target, decide that it is worthy of destruction, select the missile to be fired against the target, compute ballistics for the flight, and prepare the missile for firing.
Even if all these operations could be performed instantaneously, the *j still has a time of flight to the target of about 30 minutes.
Therefore, if the target can significantly change its location in something less than 30 minutes, the probability of having destroyed it is drastically lowered.
Because of this, it would appear inevitable that an increasing percentage of strategic missiles will seek self-protection in mobility -- at least until missile defenses are perfected which have an exceedingly high kill probability.
In order to destroy the enemy's mobile, moving, or imprecisely located strategic forces, we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to our missiles.
Until this hunter-killer operation can be performed by spacecraft, manned aircraft appear to be the only means available to us.
It seems reasonable that if general nuclear war is not to be one cataclysmic act of burning each other's citizens to cinders, we must have a manned strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of going into China or Russia to find and destroy their strategic forces which continued to threaten us.
Let us suppose the Russians decide to build a rail-mobile *j force.
It is entirely feasible to employ aircraft such as the *j or *j in hunter-killer operations against Soviet railway-based missiles.
If we stop thinking in terms of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapons and consider employing much smaller nuclear weapons which may be more appropriate for most important military targets, it would seem that the *j or *j could carry a great many small nuclear weapons.
An aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapons could very conceivably be given a mission to suppress all trains operating within a specified geographic area of Russia -- provided that we had used some of our *j to degrade Russia's air defenses before our bombers got there.
The aircraft could be used to destroy other mobile, fleeting, and imprecisely located targets as well as the known, fixed and hardened targets which can also be destroyed by missile.
Why, then, aren't we planning a larger, more important role for manned military aircraft?
Is there any other way to do the job?
Survivability of our strategic forces ( Polaris, mobile and hardened Minuteman, hardened Atlas and Titan, and airborne Skybolt ) means that it will take some time, perhaps weeks, to destroy a strategic force.
War, under these circumstances, cannot be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation.
Forces will survive a surprise attack, and these forces will give depth, or considerable duration, to the conflict.
The forces which survive the initial attack must be found and destroyed.
Even mobile forces must be found and destroyed.
But, how does one go about the job of finding and destroying mobile forces?
They are not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile.
Some day, many years in the future, true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile targets.
But until we have an effective spacecraft, the answer to the hunter-killer problem is manned aircraft.
However, the aircraft which we have today are tied to large, soft airfields.
Nuclear rockets can destroy airfields with ease.
Here then is our problem : aircraft are vital to winning a war today because they can perform those missions which a missile is totally incapable of performing ; but the airfield, on which the aircraft is completely dependent, is doomed by the missile.
This makes today's aircraft a one-shot, or one mission, weapon.
Aircraft are mighty expensive if you can use them only once.
This is the point on which so many people have written off the aircraft in favor of the missile.
But remember this -- it isn't the aircraft which is vulnerable to nuclear rockets, it is the airfield.
Eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminated its vulnerability to long-range ballistic missiles.
There are four rather obvious ways to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground : put aircraft in bomb-proof hangars when they are on the ground.
Build long-range aircraft which can take off from small ( 3,000-foot ) airfields with runways.
If we could use all the small airfields we have in this country, we could disperse our strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more.
Use nuclear propulsions to keep our long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of their useful life.
Using very high thrust-to-weight ratio engines, develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing ( V*t*o*l ) long-range military aircraft.
We have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelters which could withstand at least 200 *j.
We could put a portion of our strategic bombers in such shelters.
Large, long-range bombers can be developed which would have the capability to take off from 3,000-foot runways, but they would require more powerful engines than we have today.
There is little enthusiasm for spending money to develop more powerful engines because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft has been made obsolete by the missile.
This same preoccupation with missiles at the expense of aircraft has resulted in our half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft.
One seldom hears the analogy nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it has already done for the submarine.
If, for some reason such as economy, we are not going to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency, then we should turn our effort to developing jet engines with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one.
With powerplants such as these, vertical takeoff and landing combat aircraft could be built.
For example, a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic *j fighter.
With a 15-to-one engine, a supersonic aircraft weighing 300,000 pounds could rise vertically.
The reason that we are not going ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engines is that it would cost perhaps a billion dollars -- and you don't spend that sort of money if aircraft are obsolete.
When aircraft are no longer helpless on airfields, they are no longer vulnerable to *j.
If our *j bombers were, today, capable of surviving a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance had the capability to strike at Russia again, and again, and again, those bombers would unquestionably assure our military dominance.
We would have the means to seek out and destroy the enemy's force -- whether it were fixed or mobile.
With such a force of manned bombers we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy, and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminating.
No need to kill an entire city and all its people because we lacked the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy's military force.
Our first necessity, at the very outset of war, is post-attack reconnaissance.
In a few years we will have *j ( semiautomatic missile observation system ).
But in the case of moving targets, and targets which have limited mobility, what will their location be when it is time to destroy them?
What targets have we successfully knocked out?
A ballistic missile cannot, today, tell you if it was successful or unsuccessful.
What targets still remain to be hit?
These crucial questions must be answered by post-attack reconnaissance.
S*a*m*o*s will be hard put to see through clouds -- and to see in the dark.
Even if this is some day possible, there remains the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to its overseas target.
If the target can change its position significantly during the 30 minutes the missile is in the air on its way, the probability of the missile destroying the target is drastically reduced.
Pre-attack reconnaissance is vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow us to terminate the war favorably.
It would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance.
It could operate under the clouds and perform infrared photography through clouds and at night.
It would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any targets it discovered -- no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the United States with the chance that the target, if it were mobile, would be gone.
A large aircraft, such as the *j or *j, could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapons.
Few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1,000 *j overpressure at 100 feet.
Or put another way, the hardest missile site planned today could be destroyed by placing a one-kiloton warhead ( 1/20th the size of those used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki ) within 100 to 200 feet of the target ] it is our lack of extreme accuracy which forces the use of very large yield nuclear weapons.
Today we have side-looking radar which has such high resolution that the radar picture clearly shows individual buildings, runways, taxi-ways, separate spans of bridges, etc..
With these keen eyes and small nuclear weapons delivered with accuracy, military forces can be directly attacked with minimum damage to urban areas.
If we fail to develop the means to hunt down and destroy the enemy's military force with extreme care and precision, and if war comes in spite of our most ardent desires for peace, our choice of alternatives will be truly frightening.
The lyric beauties of Schubert's Trout Quintet -- its elemental rhythms and infectious melodies -- make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listeners.
But for students of musical forms and would-be classifiers, the work presents its problems.
Since it requires only five players, it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music -- yet it calls for a double bass, an instrument generally regarded as symphonic.
Moreover, the piece is written in five movements, rather than the conventional four of most quintets, and this gives the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor.
The many and frequent performances of the Trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of its writing.
Some renditions are of symphonic dimensions, with the contrabass given free rein.
Other interpretations present the music as an essentially intimate creation.
In these readings, the double bass is either kept discreetly in the background, or it is dressed in clown's attire -- the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop.
Recently I was struck anew by the divergent approaches, when in the course of one afternoon and evening I listened to no fewer than ten different performances.
The occasion for this marathon : Angel's long-awaited reissue in its Great Recordings Of The Century series of the Schnabel-*pro Arte version.
Let me say at the outset that the music sounded as sparkling on the last playing as it did on the first.
Whether considered alone or in relation to other editions, *j 40 is a document of prime importance.
Artur Schnabel was one of the greatest Schubert-*beethoven-*mozart players of all time, and any commentary of his on this repertory is valuable.
But Schnabel was a great teacher in addition to being a great performer, and the fact that four of the ten versions I listened to are by Schnabel pupils ( Clifford Curzon, Frank Glazer, Adrian Aeschbacher, and Victor Babin ) also sheds light on the master's pedagogical skills.
Certain pianistic traits are common to all five Schnabelian renditions, most notably the Schnabel trill ( which differs from the conventional trill in that the two notes are struck simultaneously ).
But the most impressive testimony to Schnabel's distinction as a teacher is reflected by the individuality which marks each student's approach as distinctly his own.
Schnabel's emphasis on structural clarity, his innate rhythmic vibrancy, and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp his reading as a symphonic one.
Yet no detail was too small to receive attention from this master, and as a result the playing here has humor, delicacy, and radiant humanity.
This is a serious-minded interpretation, but it is never strait-laced.
And although Schnabel's pianism bristles with excitement, it is meticulously faithful to Schubert's dynamic markings and phrase indications.
The piano performance on this Trout is one that really demands a search for superlatives.
About the Pro Arte's contribution I am less happy.
I, for one, rather regret that Schnabel didn't collaborate with the Budapest Quartet, whose rugged, athletic playing was a good deal closer to this pianist's interpretative outlook than the style of the Belgian group.
From a technical standpoint, the string playing is good, but the Pro Arte people fail to enter into the spirit of things here.
The violinist, in particular, is very indulgent with swoops and slides, and his tone is pinched and edgy.
The twenty-five-year-old recording offers rather faded string tone, but the balance between the instruments is good and the transfer is very quiet.
There is a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the Forellen movement, and I suspect that this is due to imperfect splicing between sides of the original *j.
Turning to the more modern versions, Curzon's ( London ) offers the most sophisticated keyboard work.
Every detail in his interpretation has been beautifully thought out, and of these I would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist brings to the fifth variation ( an obvious indication that he is playing with Viennese musicians ), and the gossamer shading throughout.
Some of Curzon's playing strikes me as finicky, however.
Why, for example, does he favor two tempos, rather than one, for the third movement?
The assisting musicians from the Vienna Octet are somewhat lacking in expertise, but their contribution is rustic and appealing.
( special compliments to the double bass playing of Johann Krumpp : his scrawny, tottering sound adds a delightful hilarity to the performance.
) the Glazer-*fine Arts edition ( Concert-*disc ) is a model of lucidity and organization.
It is, moreover, a perfectly integrated ensemble effort.
But having lived with the disc for some time now, I find the performance less exciting than either Schnabel's or Fleisher's ( whose superb performance with the Budapest Quartet has still to be recorded ) and a good deal less filled with humor than Curzon's.
Aeschbacher's work is very much akin to Schnabel's, but the sound on his Decca disc is dated, and you will have a hard time locating a copy of it.
The Hephzibah Menuhin-*amadeus Quartet ( Angel ) and Victor Babin-*festival Quartet ( R*c*a Victor ) editions give us superlative string playing ( both in symphonic style ) crippled by unimaginative piano playing.
( Babin has acquired some of Schnabel's keyboard manner, but his playing is of limited insight.
) Badura-*skoda-*vienna Konzerthaus ( Westminster ) and Demus-*schubert Quartet ( Deutsche Grammophon ) are both warm-toned, pleasantly lyrical, but rather slack and tensionless.
Helmut Roloff, playing with a group of musicians from the Bayreuth Ensemble, gives a sturdy reading, in much the same vein as that of the last-mentioned pianists.
Telefunken has accorded him beautiful sound, and this bargain-priced disc ( it sells for $2.98 ) is worthy of consideration.
Returning once again to the Schnabel reissue, I am beguiled anew by the magnificence of this pianist's musical penetration.
Here is truly a Great Recording of the Century, and its greatness is by no means diminished by the fact that it is not quite perfect.
This recording surely belongs in everyone's collection.
Must records always sound like records?
From the beginning of commercial recording, new discs purported to be indistinguishable from The Real Thing have regularly been put in circulation.
Seen in perspective, many of these releases have a genuine claim to be milestones.
Although lacking absolute verisimilitude, they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary materials for re-creation of the original.
On the basis of what they give us we can know how the young Caruso sang, appreciate the distinctive qualities of Parsifal under Karl Muck's baton, or sense the type of ensemble Toscanini created in his years with the New York Philharmonic.
Since the concept of high fidelity became important some dozen years ago, the claims of technical improvements have multiplied tenfold.
In many cases the revolutionary production has offered no more than sensational effects : the first hearing was fascinating and the second disillusioning as the gap between sound and substance became clearer.
Other innovations with better claims to musical interest survived rehearing to acquire in time the status of classics.
If we return to them today, we have no difficulty spotting their weaknesses but we find them still pleasing.
Records sound like records because they provide a different sort of experience than live music.
This difference is made up of many factors.
Some of them are obvious, such as the fact that we associate recorded and live music with our responses and behavior in different types of environments and social settings.
( music often sounds best to me when I can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat.
) from the technical standpoint, records differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color, texture, complexity, range, intensity, pulse, and pitch of the original.
Any alteration of one of these factors is distortion, although we generally use that word only for effects so pronounced that they can be stated quantitatively on the basis of standard tests.
Yet it is the accumulation of distortion, the fitting together of fractional bits until the total reaches the threshold of our awareness, that makes records sound like records.
The sound may be good ; but if you know The Real Thing, you know that what you are hearing is only a clever imitation.
Command's new Brahms Second is a major effort to make a record that sounds like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one.
Like the recent Scheherazade from London ( High Fidelity, Sept. 1961 ), it is successful because emphasis has been placed on good musical and engineering practices rather than on creating sensational effects.
Because of this, only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineers' triumph.
The easiest way to describe this release is to say that it reproduces an interesting and effective Steinberg performance with minimal alteration of its musical values.
The engineering as such never obtrudes upon your consciousness.
The effect of the recording is very open and natural, with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance.
This absence of peaky highs and beefed-up bass not only produces greater fidelity, but it eliminates listener fatigue.
A contributing factor is the perspective, the uniform aesthetic distance which is maintained.
The orchestra is far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrapes, valve clicks, and other noises incidental to playing.
Yet you feel the orchestra is near at hand, and the individual instruments have the same firm presence associated with listening from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall.
Command has achieved the ideal amount of reverberation.
The music is always allowed the living space needed to attain its full sonority ; yet the hall never intrudes as a quasi-performer.
The timbre remains that of the instruments unclouded by resonance.
All of this would be wasted, of course, if the performance lacked authority and musical distinction.
For me it has more of both elements than the majority of its competitors.
Steinberg seems to have gone directly back to the score, discounting tradition, and has built his performance on the intention to reproduce as faithfully as possible exactly what Brahms set down on paper.
Those accustomed to broader, more romantic statements of the symphony can be expected to react strongly when they hear this one.
Without losing the distinctive undertow of Brahmsian rhythm, the pacing is firm and the over-all performance has a tightly knit quality that makes for maximum cumulative effect.
The Presto Ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo is taken literally and may shock you, as the real Allegro con Spirito of the finale is likely to bring you to your feet.
In the end, however, the thing about this performance that is most striking is the way it sings.
Steinberg obviously has concluded that it is the lyric element which must dominate in this score, and he manages at times to create the effect of the whole orchestra bursting into song.
The engineering provides exactly the support needed for such a result.
Too many records seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and its accompaniment.
The Command technique invites you to listen to the depth of the orchestration.
Your ear takes you into the ensemble, and you may well become aware of instrumental details which previously were apparent only in the score.
It is this sort of experience that makes the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener.
The first substantially complete stereo Giselle ( and the only one of its scope since Feyer's four-sided *j edition of 1958 for Angel ), this set is, I'm afraid, likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment.
The already faded pastel charms of the naive music itself vanish entirely in Fistoulari's melodramatic contrasts between ultravehement brute power and chilly, if suave, sentimentality.
And in its engineers' frantic attempts to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance, the recording sounds as though it had been doctored for super-high fidelity.
The home listener is overpowered, all right, but the experience is a far from pleasant one.
As with the penultimate Giselle release ( Wolff's abridgment for R*c*a Victor ) I find the cleaner, less razor-edged monophonic version, for all its lack of big-stage spaciousness, the more aurally tolerable -- but this may be the result of processing defects in my *j copies.
At the Westminster *j Dog Show in Madison Square Garden, New York on the second day, the Finals of the Junior Class brought out the most competitive competition in the history of this Class.
The Class had entries from as far west as Wisconsin and as far south as Kentucky.
This year several entries from Canada were entered which made the Junior Class International.
Forty-six of the 53 Juniors who mailed in entries were present.
It was interesting to note that many of these Juniors were showing dogs in various other classes at the show prior to the Finals of the Junior Class.
As has been the custom for the past several years, John Cross, Jr., Bench Show Chmn. of Westminster, arranged for the Juniors' meeting before the Class, and invited two speakers from the dog world to address them.
Over 60 Juniors, parents and guests attended.
Mrs. William H. Long, Jr. speaks after the Juniors were welcomed and congratulated for qualifying for the Finals of the Junior Class, Mrs. William H. Long, Jr. was introduced as the first speaker.
In her opening remarks Mrs. Long also welcomed the Juniors and stated, there isn't any other show quite like Westminster.
I know because this is my 37th year with hardly a break.
Mrs. Long still feels the same unique spirit of Westminster which she stated the present Juniors will experience today but probably will not appreciate in full for a number of years.
Twenty years ago her daughter Betsey Long, then 13 years of age, won the Grand Challenge Trophy, Children's Handling Class ( as they were called then ) at Westminster.
No sooner had Betsey come out of the ring than Mrs. Long walked into the Working Competition with Ch. Cadet or Noranda, another home-bred product, and won ] speaking from long years of experience, Mrs. Long advised the Juniors : when showing dogs ceases to be fun and excitement, stop ] dogs have a way of sensing our feelings ] when you and your dog step into the Junior ring, it should be just what the dog wants to do as much as what you want him to do.
If you walk into the ring because it is fun to show your dog, he will feel it and give you a good performance ] he knows your signals, what is expected of him and the way the Class is conducted, right up through the flash-bulbs of the photographers.
Right attitude essential ] take away your attitude, said Mrs. Long, and what have you left?
Either a nervous dog because you are livid with rage -- a sure sign that you are taking things too seriously and had better stop ] or a bored dog because you are more interested in something else -- maybe the way you look, or the date you have after the Class, or you are just doing this to please the parents.
The reason you are in the ring today is to show your ability to present to any judge the most attractive picture of your dog that the skillful use of your aids can produce.
Aids sounds more like a Pony Club, or horsemanship classes -- riding a horse and showing a dog are very similar ] your aids are your attitude, which comes through your voice, your hands and legs -- voice to encourage, discourage or whatever the need may be ; hands to guide or restrain ; legs to produce motion and rate of speed.
Without right attitude the other aids just do not work right.
Mrs. Long wished all the Juniors luck in the Class and stated, have fun ] and may you all continue to show at Westminster in the years to come ] Harvey Barcus, second speaker the second speaker was Harvey Barcus, President of the Dog Writers Ass'n of America.
Mr. Barcus spoke on the subject of scholarships for Juniors -- with which he is very familiar.
Last year a boy he knows and helped in Journalism won the Thoroughbred Racing Ass'n Scholarship which is worth $10,000.
He gave a resume of the steps taken in order for the boy he sponsored to win the scholarship.
Junior Showmanship is an extremely worthy project and should be earnestly encouraged ] is one of Mr. Barcus' strong beliefs.
He feels very forcibly that the American Kennel Club should take a more active part in encouraging the Junior Division ] in closing, Mr. Barcus also wished all the Juniors luck in their Class.
Westminster Show Notes instead of 3 a.m. in the past, the Juniors Class at Westminster was held at 4:45 p.m..
This gave the Juniors the use of the entire ring at the show -- a great advantage to them ] before the Juniors entered the ring the Steward announced that after all Juniors had moved their dogs around the ring and set them up, they could relax with their dogs.
From there on, each Junior was going to be judged individually.
This thoughtful gesture was well received by the Juniors as the Class had an entry of 46 Juniors and it took approximately one hour, 45 minutes to judge the Class.
Anne Hone Rogers judges 28th finals this year Anne Hone Rogers, outstanding Handler, judged the Class.
This is the third time in 28 years of Junior Showmanship at Westminster that a lady Handler has judged the Class.
As the Juniors entered the ring, Mr. Spring, the announcer, stated over the public-address system that this was the 28th year that Westminster has held the Finals of the Junior Competition.
Juniors competed last year at American Kennel Club and Canadian Kennel Club, recognized shows to be eligible to compete in this Class -- the Finals for the year.
A Junior who won two or more wins in the Open Class was eligible.
( the purpose of the Junior Showmanship Competition is to teach and encourage Juniors to become good sportsmen.
Many adults showing at Westminster today are products of this Class.
) it seemed an almost impossible job for Miss Rogers to select 4 winners from the 46 Juniors entered.
A large number of these Juniors have 7 and 8 wins to their credit and are seasoned campaigners.
After the judge moved all the dogs individually, she selected several from the group and placed them in the center of the ring.
She then went over them thoroughly giving each a strenuous test in showmanship.
International Champion of the year Betty Lou Ham, age 16, Holyoke, Mass., showing an Irish Setter, was chosen as International Champion of the year.
She was awarded the Professional Handlers' Ass'ns' Leonard Brumby, Sr. Memorial Trophy ( named for the founder-originator of the Junior Classes.
) Betty is 16 years of age and had several wins to her credit last year.
In addition to showing an Irish Setter throughout the year, she also scored with an Afghan.
Other winners Sydney Le Blanc, age 15, Staten Island, N.*y., showing a Doberman Pinscher, was 2nd.
Susan Hackmann, age 14, from Baltimore, Md., showing a Dachshund, was 3rd.
Last year Susan also placed 3rd in the Finals at Westminster.
From the records we keep -- Susan is the only Junior who has placed in the Junior Classes in both United States and Canada.
Karen Marcmann, age 16, Trapp, Penna., showing a Keeshond was 4th.
Most Juniors who were entered in the Finals are seasoned campaigners and not only show and win in Junior Classes but score in the Breed Classes as well.
Entries increasing -- requirements raised in 1960, there were 7287 entries in the Junior Classes.
Each year these shows have increased in entries.
Next year 1962, at Westminster, the Bench Show Committee has raised the requirements so that a junior must win 3 or more Junior Classes in the open division only to qualify for Westminster.
Percy Roberts, a leading judge will not be at the International Show this year for the Junior Judging Contest as he has been invited to judge in Australia in March.
Judging class for intermediates proposed it has been suggested many times that a Class be set up for the Juniors who are overage and cannot enter the Junior Classes.
For some time this writer has been suggesting a Junior Judging Class for Intermediates over 16 and under 20 years of age who are ineligible to compete in the Junior Class.
Such a Class was tried out successfully at the Westchester *j Show recently.
Not only were the contestants pleased with the Class, but it aroused the interest of all in attendance that day.
The Intermediates in the Class with the Judge were asked to pick 4 winners and give their reasons but their decisions did not affect the choice of the Judge.
We suggested this Class in the horse world and it was accepted immediately and included in the programs of horse shows.
At the recent horse show convention in New York it was stated that this Intermediate Judging Class is meeting with great success and will be a great help to future judges in the horse world.
This Class can be just as successful in the dog world if it is given a chance.
Last year Robert Harris, a leading Junior Handler entered the Dog Judging Contest ( Junior ) at the International *j of Chicago show and had the highest score in judging of any Junior since the Class' inception.
Juniors who attend this Chicago show should make a point to enter this Class as it would be of great help to them.
More volunteer handlers needed to judge superintendents at dog shows state it is becoming more difficult to obtain a licensed Handler to Judge Junior Showmanship Competition.
The founder of the Junior Showmanship Competition the late Leonard Brumby, Sr. ( whom the trophy is named after at Westminster ) was an outstanding Handler and believed a Junior should have an opportunity to exhibit in a dog show starting with the Junior Showmanship Division.
Some years ago this Class was judged by celebrities who knew nothing of what was required of a Junior's ability to show a dog.
To overcome this unfair judging, the A.*k.*c. requires that a licensed Handler be present to judge the Class.
If the superintendents do not receive more cooperation from Handlers, it has been suggested that licensed Judges also be qualified to judge this Class.
By recognizing and helping Juniors get interested in the dog world, all will be helping to create future dog owners.
Other awards for Juniors the Airedale Terrier Club of America and the Kerry Blue Terrier Club of America have under consideration donating trophies to the boys or girls who win with their breeds in Junior Showmanship Competition at any Show.
The Kansas City and the Topeka *j are arranging that Juniors who win at their shows will be qualified to win points for Westminster.
The Rio Grande *j is also considering having their Junior Classes set up so that Juniors can qualify with points for Westminster.
The American Pointer Club is still continuing to donate trophies to Juniors who win at Junior Showmanship Classes with Pointers.
Traveling through the South -- over 16,000 miles -- with two Great Danes, an Afghan, and a Persian kitten, we've worked up a regular routine for acceptance at motels.
My husband enters the motel office, signs up for a room, and then solemnly asks the proprieter if he accepts pets.
Puppies?
Comes the suspicious question.
No, he replies, full grown, adult show dogs, housebroken, and obedience-trained.
We've never been refused ] once settled, we're careful to walk the dogs in an out of the way spot, keep them under control in the room, and feed and bench them where they can't do any harm to the furnishings or the furniture.
In the morning we leave the room looking as neat as a pin ] many a motel owner -- when we've stopped there again -- has remembered us and has said he preferred our dogs to most children.
So many times I have wondered why veterinarians do not wipe the table clean before each new canine patient is placed on it for examination.
Is it that they don't care?
Are they indifferent to the fact that the dog can easily pick up germs from the preceding patient?
At one time, to most Americans, unless they were fortunate enough to live near a body of navigable water, boats were considered the sole concern of fishermen, rich people, and the United States Navy.
Today the recreational boating scene is awash with heartening statistics which prove the enormous growth of that sport.
There are more than 8,000,000 recreational boats in use in the United States with almost 10,000,000 the prediction for within the next decade.
About 40,000,000 people participated in boating in 1960.
Boating has become a giant whose strides cover the entire nation from sea to shining sea.
Boats are operated in every state in the Union, with the heaviest concentrations along both coasts and in the Middle West.
The spectacular upsurge in pleasure boating is markedly evident, expectedly, in the areas where boats have always been found : the natural lakes, rivers, and along the nation's coastline.
But during the last several years boats were launched in areas where, a short time ago, the only water to be found was in wells and watering troughs for livestock.
Developed as a result of the multi-purpose resources control program of the government, vast, man-made bodies of water represent a kind of glorious fringe benefit, providing boating and fishing havens all over the country.
No matter how determined or wealthy boating lovers of the Southwest had been, for example, they could never have created anything approaching the fifty square-mile Lake Texoma, located between Texas and Oklahoma, which resulted when the Corp of Army Engineers dammed the Red River.
In 1959, according to the Engineers, Lake Texoma was only one of thirty-two artificial lakes and reservoirs which were used for recreation by over 1,000,000 persons.
Where an opportunity to enjoy boating has not been created by bringing bodies of water to the people, means have been found to take the people and their boats to the water.
Providing these means are about ninety companies which manufactured the estimated 1,800,000 boat trailers now in use.
It is a simple task to haul a boat fifty or one hundred miles to a lake or reservoir on the new, light, strong, easy-to-operate trailers which are built to accommodate almost any kind of small boat and retail from $100 to $2,000.
The sight of sleek inboards, outboards, and sailboats being wheeled smartly along highways many miles from any water is commonplace.
Boatmen lucky enough to have facilities for year-'round anchorage for their craft, will recall the tedious procedure of loading their gear into the car, driving to the water, and making trip after trip to transfer the gear to the boat.
Today, the boat, on its trailer, is brought to the gear and loaded at the door.
Arriving at the waterside, the boat is launched, the family taken aboard and, that easily, another day afloat is begun.
And trailers for boats are not what they started out to be ten years ago.
This year, Americans will discover previously unheard of refinements in trailers that will be exhibited in about one hundred of our nation's national, regional and local boat shows.
The boats of America's trailer sailors in 1961 will be coddled on clouds as they are hauled to new horizons.
The variety of craft on the country's waters today is overwhelming.
They range from an eight-foot pram, which you can build yourself for less than $50, to auxiliary sailboats which can cost over $100,000.
Boat prices vary according to the buyer's desires or needs.
In this respect, boats can be compared with houses.
There is no limit to what you can spend, yet it is easily possible to keep within a set budget.
There is no question as to just what is available.
You name it, our industry is producing it, and it probably is made in different models.
There are canoes ideal for fishing in protected waters or for camping trips.
There are houseboats which are literally homes afloat, accommodating whole families in comfort and convenience.
You can cross an ocean in a fully equipped craft, sail, power, or both, or laze away a fine day in a small dinghy on a local pond.
You may have your boat of wood, canvas, plywood, plastic, or metal.
You may order utility models, inboard or outboard, with or without toilets, galleys, and bunks.
You may dress it up with any number of accessories or keep it as simple as you choose.
Designers and manufacturers have produced models for purchasers who run the gamut from a nautical version of the elderly Pasadena lady who never drove more than five miles an hour on her once-a-month ride around the block, to the sportiest boatman who insists on all the dash, color, flair and speed possible to encompass in a single boat.
You pay your money and you take your choice.
American technology in engine and hull design is largely responsible for the plentiful interest in American boating.
I wonder if anyone ever bothered to make the point that when it comes to boats and their motors, Americans excel over any country in the world in the long run.
Russia, whose technology is not quite primitive, is still in the dark ages when it comes to improving the outboard motor, for instance.
Now here is truly a marvel.
The outboard engine of today has a phenomenal range of one to 80 horsepower, unheard of a few years ago for a two cycle engine in quantity production.
These engines can be removed from a boat with relative ease, wherein lies their greatest advantage.
Their cost is not beyond the hopes of the American pocketbook, the range being about $150 to $1,000, depending on size.
Great thought has been given to making life easier for the growing boating population of the country ; and to making the owning of a boat simpler.
There was a time when, if a man wanted to purchase a boat, it was necessary for him to be able to produce a sizeable amount of cash before he could touch the tiller or wheel.
Having a boat financed through a local bank is done much the same way as an automobile loan is extended.
Marine dealers and even some manufacturers who sell direct in non-dealer areas cooperate in enabling you to launch now and pay later.
Terms range from one to five years and the interest rates and down payments run about the same as for automobiles.
Of course, individual financing arrangements depend a good deal on the purchaser's earning power, credit rating and local bank policy.
Outboard motors, insurance, and boat repairs may also be financed in the same way as boats.
Terms and rates of interest for motors generally follow those for home appliances.
When the automobile was in its embryonic stage, such roads as existed were pretty much open roads with the tacit understanding that horses should not be unduly terrified being about the only rule governing where, when and how fast a car could go.
When air travel was in its infancy, the sky was considered big enough and high enough for all.
Man had enough to worry about managing to get up there and stay without being burdened with rules once aloft.
It was much the same with pleasure boating at first.
Come one, come all, the water's fine ] as the ungoverned days of the automobile and the airplane are long since relegated to the past, so is the carefree attitude toward what a boatman may and may not do ; must and should do.
However, there is a minimum of legislative restriction on boating.
Laws on boating vary according to the state in which the craft is to be used and according to its horsepower.
What may be acceptable in one state may be strictly prohibited across the boundary line.
The main requirement is to be sure the boat is numbered according to the regulations of the state in which the boat will be principally used.
If your state has no provisions for the numbering of pleasure boats, you must apply for a number from the U.*s. Coast Guard for any kind of boat with mechanical propulsion rated at more than 10 horsepower before it can be used on Federal waterways.
State numbering laws differ from each other in many ways.
Fees are not the same and some states do not require certain craft, such as sailboats with no power, to be registered at all.
Many states have laws regulating the use of boat trailers and some have restrictions regarding the age of motor boat operators.
Generally, states reserve for communities the right to have local ordinances regulating speed and other activities.
It is always wise to consult your marine dealer, local yacht or boat club secretary, or local law enforcement officers if you are not positive what the regulations are.
Ignorance of the law is no better excuse on the water than it is on land ; lack of ability and common sense can lead to just as much tragedy.
Hand in hand with the legislative program is the industry's self originated and directed safety program.
Foreseeing the possible threats to safety with the rapid growth of the sport, the industry has been supporting an intense, coordinated educational program with great success since 1947.
A primary factor in the success of the safety program has been the enthusiastic cooperation of the individual manufacturers.
The industry has been its own watch dog.
With U.*s. Coast Guard cooperation, the American Boat and Yacht Council was formed to develop recommended practices and standards for boats and their equipment with reference to safety.
Industry interest in safety goes even farther.
In 1959, the Yacht Safety Bureau was reorganized by the National Association of Engine and Boat Manufacturers and a group of insurance underwriters to provide a testing laboratory and labeling service for boats and their equipment.
A new waterfront site for the bureau is now being built at Atlantic City, New Jersey, to provide the most modern marine testing facilities as a further tool to keep the sport safe.
In addition to these activities, the *j, with headquarters at 420 Lexington Avenue, New York City, as well as other associations and individual manufacturers, provide and distribute films, booklets, and public services in regard to proper boat handling and safety afloat.
It is important to note the work of the United States Power Squadrons and the U.*s. Coast Guard Auxiliary.
Each of these fine groups gives free boating classes in seamanship piloting and small boat handling.
These are not governmentally subsidized organizations.
This year, over 100,000 persons will receive this free instruction.
As America on wheels was responsible for an industry of motor courts, motels, and drive-in establishments where you can dine, see a movie, shop, or make a bank deposit, the ever-increasing number of boating enthusiasts have sparked industries designed especially to accommodate them.
Instead of motels, for the boatman there are marinas.
The word marina was coined by *j originally to describe a waterfront facility where recreational boats could find protection and basic needs to lay over in relative comfort.
Currently, marina is used to indicate a municipal or commercially operated facility where a pleasure boat may dock and find some or all of the following available : gasoline, fresh water, electricity, telephone service, ice, repair facilities, restaurants, sleeping accommodations, a general store, and a grocery store.
Yachtel, a relatively new word, indicates a waterfront type of hotel where a yachtsman may dock and find overnight accommodations on the premises as well as other services.
Boatel has a similar meaning to yachtel.
It indicates the same thing but it is meant to pertain more specifically to establishments designed to cater to smaller type boats such as outboards.
Regardless of nomenclature, yachtels and boatels are marinas.
Boatyards which also provide some of the above facilities may rightfully be called marinas.
A recent survey disclosed there are about 4,000 commercially and municipally operated marinas and boatyards in the United States, the majority of which are equipped to handle outboard boats.
The design of a mechanical interlocking frame is much like a mechanical puzzle, but once understood, the principles can be applied to any track and signal arrangement.
In the frame are two sets of bars which interact with each other to prevent the operator from making dangerous moves.
The main set of bars are the tappets and one tappet is connected to each lever.
If the lever is pulled to clear a signal or move a switch, the tappet moves a short distance lengthwise at the same time.
Close behind the plane of the tappets are the locking bars.
These can also move a short distance but at right angles to the tappets.
The number of locking bars required depends on how many false moves must be prevented.
In the sides of the tappets are notches with sloping sides, and connection between the tappets and locking bars consist of cams called dogs.
Two or more dogs are mounted on each locking bar.
These slide into and out of the notches in the tappets as the tappets are moved, locking and unlocking them.
Here's how the scheme works : suppose the operator pulls the lever to clear a particular signal.
This also pulls the tappet connected to the particular lever and forces any dogs seated in the notches to the side, thus moving one or more locking bars.
The dogs on the other ends of these locking bars are thus forced into notches in other tappets.
By this scheme, pulling one signal to clear locks all the other switch and signal levers in safe positions until the first signal is again restored to normal.
Interlocking signals are normally at stop or red position, and a lever must be pulled to clear the signal.
This is not necessarily to green, however, for in some situations only a yellow indication is given to a train to let it into the plant.
There are other basic rules.
A turnout may have two levers, one to actually move the switch points, the other to lock the points.
A signal cannot be cleared until all the related turnouts are properly thrown and locked.
Such locks are nearly always used where the switch points face oncoming traffic.
The lock insures that the points are thrown all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly thrown point.
If the points aren't thrown all the way, the Turnout cannot be locked, and in turn, the signal cannot be cleared.
Generally, these locks on turnouts are called facing point locks.
Figs. 1-6 show typical arrangements of track and signals.
Each diagram is accompanied by a dog chart, a list of the levers that show which other levers any particular lever will lock if pulled.
The lines connecting the wedge-shaped dogs represent the locking bars at right angles to the tappet bars.
By studying the track-signal diagrams you'll note several other details.
Derails -- mechanical track devices that actually guide the wheels off the rails if a train passes a stop signal -- are used in many instances.
Home signals have two blades.
The blacked-in blades indicate a fixed aspect -- the blade does not move.
As an engineer approaches the plant the position of the home signal is seen in advance when he passes the distant signal located beyond the limits of the interlocking plant.
In some low-speed situations, the distant signal is fixed at caution.
In other instances where there is no automatic block signaling, the distant has only green and yellow aspects.
So much for the prototype.
The interlocking frame we built at the model railroader workshop and then installed on Paul Larson's railroad follows the Fig. 1 scheme and is shown beginning in Fig. 7, page 65, and in the photos.
Here's how it can be built.
Frame the sizes of pieces needed for the interlocking frame are shown in the notes within Fig. 7, most of the bars being 1/8'' brass in 1/4'' and 1/2'' widths.
You may change the dimensions to suit a frame for more or fewer levers and locks as you wish.
Our instructions assume you are building this particular frame, which is for a junction.
When cutting the pieces, dress the ends smooth, and square with a smooth file or sanding disk.
Start with the right-hand piece *j, *f, soldering it to the lower piece *j of the same material but 12'' long.
Let exactly 1'' of *j extend beyond *j and use a square to check your angle to exactly 90 degrees.
Now lay 12 pieces of *f cut 5-3/4'' long side by side but separated by 12 pieces of the same material 1/2'' sq..
This gives you the spacing for locating the left-hand piece *j.
Compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for *j.
Solder this second *j to *j at right angles.
There should be 10'' between the two parallel members and each should be 1'' from an end of the long piece.
Cap this assembly ( with spacing bars in place ) with a *f bar.
Tack-solder all the 1/2'' sq. pieces to the 10'' and 12'' members.
These will be drilled and tapped later on.
Now cut five *f locking bar spacers ( which run horizontally ).
Position these using six intermediate temporary *f spacers and locate the upper 12'' bar *j.
Solder it and the five locking bar spacers to the frame.
Now place 12 pieces 1/2'' sq. on this edge as we did before and space them with the 5-3/4'' long tappets, as they are called.
Cap with a *f bar and tack-solder in place.
Cap the locking bar spacers with two *f directly under the first two *j pieces.
Remove all the loose spacing bars.
Mark and center-punch all the holes required for screws to hold this assembly together.
See Fig. 7.
Placement of these holes is not critical, but they should be located so that the centers are about 1/8'' from any edge.
Drill all No. 50 and counter-drill all except the *j pieces size 43.
Tap the *j pieces 2-56.
Now unsolder and disassemble the frame except for the two 12'' and the first two 3-3/4'' bars ( *j and *j pieces ), which are soldered together.
Either lay the components aside in proper order or code them with numbers and letters so they may be replaced in their proper positions.
Dress all surfaces with a file, cleaning off all solder and drilling burrs.
Drill 20 No. 47 holes in the upper piece *j as shown in Fig. 7.
Tap these 3-48 for mounting the electrical contact later on.
Note, 6 and 8 lock levers don't require holes for contacts.
Now reassemble the frame, using *f roundhead steel screws and nuts.
Put the 12 tappets and some *f locking bar spacers in the frame to help align all the components before you tighten the screws.
Be sure the tappets are not pinched by a twisted 1/2'' sq. spacer.
As an anchor for the spring lock, insert a *f bar in the lower left corner of the frame as shown in Fig. 7.
Drill a No. 43 hole through the pieces and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw.
Drill two No. 50 holes, one in the insert and one in the locking bar spacer directly above it, and tap 2-56.
Number all the tappet bars before removing them so they can be replaced in the same slots.
Remove all other loose pieces and file the edges of the basic frame smooth.
Cut five pieces of *f brass bar stock 3-3/4'' long.
These are supporting members for the short locking bars.
Locate their positions in Fig. 7 and drill No. 43 to match the corresponding holes in the frame.
Cut off excess screw lengths and file flush with either frame or nut.
Drill four No. 19 and four No. 28 holes in the 12'' long *j pieces.
Locate the position from Fig. 7.
Tappets and locking bars draw-file No. 1 tappet to a smooth fit in its respective slot and square the ends.
Break the end corners with a slight 45 degree chamfer.
Drill a No. 50 hole 1-1/4'' from one end and tap 2-56.
( see Fig. 7.
) put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole, cut off the excess threads and file flush with the underside of the bar.
To find the other stop screw position, insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge.
Scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet, 1/4'' plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head ( about 5/64'' ) away from the frame edge.
Total distance is about 21/64''.
Tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 1/4'' tappet movement.
Drill a No. 50 hole, tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw as you did on the first end.
Drill a No. 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position shown in Figs. 7 and 8.
Repeat these drill and tap operations for each of the tappet bars.
To each tappet except 6 and 8, solder a *f piece of brass and file to the tapered shape shown in Figs. 6 and 8.
These will serve as lifting pads for the electrical contacts.
Fitting the locking bars and making the locking pieces is a rather tedious job since stop screws, tappets and locking bars must be removed and replaced many times.
As the work progresses the frame and moving parts become a sort of Chinese puzzle where several pieces must be removed before the part you are working on is accessible.
A little extra work here will pay off with a smooth, snug-fitting machine when you are finished.
Each completed locking bar should remain in place as the work progresses to insure snug fitting.
The order of fitting is not too important.
However, we started with the first row of bars and worked our way back.
Since the same method of shaping and fitting the dogs and notches is used throughout, we will only describe the construction of one locking bar.
Figs. 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimensions.
All the bars are cut from *f brass.
The lengths of each piece are listed at the bottom of Fig. 7.
Bar *j is 2-3/4'' long.
Draw-file the edges, square up the ends and put a slight chamfer on the edges so they will not snag in the frame.
Fig. 8 gives the dimensions for locating the dog-pin holes.
Center-punch and drill the No. 31 hole 7/16'' from one end of the bar.
Chuck a length of 1/8'' dia. drill rod into a drill press or some similar turning device and while it is rotating file the end square and then file a slight taper 1/8'' long.
Cut the piece about 9/32'' or 5/16'' long and drive it into the No. 31 hole drilled in the locking bar.
File the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 1/8'' above the bar.
This dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3.
Place the locking bar in proper position and insert tappet 3.
Scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3, parallel to piece *j.
See the drawings for the shape of the notch.
Scribe *j lines on the bar and rough out with either a hack saw or a cutting disk in a hand power tool.
We used the latter equipped with a carborundum disk about.020''
Thick and 1'' dia. fitted on a 1/8'' dia. mandrel.
Such disks are very handy for cutting and shaping small parts.
File to a smooth finish.
A Barrette Swiss pattern file is handy since its triangular shape with only one cutting face will allow you to work a surface without marring an adjoining one.
Endeavor to get the notches as much alike as possible.
The notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it.
Assemble the parts in the frame and test the sliding action of the mating pieces.
All matching surfaces should be checked frequently and mated on a cut and fit basis.
Chuck a 2'' or 3'' piece of 1/8'' dia. drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool.
Fashion a sharp scribing point about 3/64'' long on one end, using Swiss pattern files.
This tool can also be made with a lathe.
Scientists say that the world and everything in it are based on mathematics.
Without math the men who are continually seeking the causes of and the reasons for the many things that make the world go 'round would not have any means of analyzing, standardizing, and communicating the things they discover and learn.
Math and the formulas that allow it to be applied to different problems are, therefore, essential to any scientific endeavor.
Hot rodding is a science.
It's not a science as involved as determining what makes the earth rotate on its axis or building a rocket or putting a satellite into orbit but it is, nevertheless, a science.
But because science is based on mathematics doesn't mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician.
A guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for years without becoming even remotely involved with mathematical problems ; however, he will have a clearer understanding of what he is doing and the chances are he will be more successful if he understands the few formulas that apply to rodding.
A mathematical formula is nothing more than a pattern for solving a specific problem.
It places the various factors involved in the problem in their correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factors on each other can be computed.
The first step in using a formula is to insert the numerical values of the factors involved in their correct positions in the formula.
This changes the formula to an equation.
The equation is used for the mathematical process of solving the problem.
Equations for rodding formulas are not complicated.
They involve only simple mathematics that are taught in grammar school arithmetic classes.
However, it is essential that the various mathematical symbols used in the equations be understood so that the mathematical processes can be done properly and in their correct order.
They indicate simple division, multiplication, subtraction, and addition.
The symbol for division is a straight line that separates two numbers placed one above the other.
The lower number is always divided into the upper number : *f.
The symbol for multiplication is *j.
It is used to separate two or more numbers in a row.
For example : *f.
Numbers to be multiplied together may be multiplied in any order.
The result will be the same regardless of the order used.
The symbol for subtraction is the standard minus sign.
This is nothing more than a dash.
It separates two or more numbers.
The number on the right of the symbol is always subtracted from the number on the left of the symbol.
For example : *f.
When more than two figures are separated by subtraction symbols the subtraction must be carried out from the left to right if the result is to be correct.
For example, for the problem *f, 10 from 25 equals 15, then 6 from 15 equals 9.
Addition is indicated by the + symbol.
The symbol is used to separate two or more numbers.
For example : *f.
Numbers separated by addition symbols may be placed in any order.
When solving an equation that involves division as well as other steps, do all the division steps first to reduce those parts of the equation to their numerical value.
Multiplication, subtraction, and addition can then be accomplished as they appear in the equation by starting at the left end of the equation and working toward the right.
Completing the division first also includes those division parts that require multiplication, subtraction, or addition steps : *f.
This would be reduced by multiplying 8 times 6 and then dividing the product by 12.
This part of the equation would then become 4.
For use in formulas, fractions should be converted to their decimal equivalents.
The easiest way to do this is with a conversion chart.
Charts for this purpose are available from many sources.
They are included in all types of mathematical handbooks and they are stamped on some types of precision measuring instruments.
The various mathematical processes can be simplified by carrying the results to only two or three decimal places.
Shortening the results in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result.
Some formulas contain constants.
A constant is a number that remains the same regardless of the other numbers used in the formula and the resultant equation.
It is a number without which the equation cannot be solved correctly.
Rodding formulas apply to many phases of the sport.
The answers they give can often pave the way to performance increases and, quite often, are necessary for completing entry blanks for different events.
When it is needed, one formula is as important as another.
However, some formulas are used more than others.
We'll take them in the general order of their popularity.
Engine displacement a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of his engine.
Displacement is sometimes referred to as swept volume.
Most entry blanks for competitive events require engine displacement information because of class restrictions.
It is good to be able to compute displacement so that changes in it resulting from boring and stroking can be computed.
Factors involved in the displacement formula are the bore diameter of the engine's cylinders, the length of the piston stroke, the number of cylinders in the engine, and a constant.
The constant is.7854
, which is one-quarter of 3.1416, another constant known as pi.
Pi is used in formulas concerned with the dimensions of circles.
Actually, the engine displacement formula is the standard formula for computing the volume of a cylinder of any type with an added factor that represents the number of cylinders in the engine.
The cross-sectional area of the cylinders is determined and then the volume of the individual cylinders is computed by multiplying the area by the stroke length, which is the equivalent of the length of the cylinders.
Multiplying the result by the number of cylinders in the engine gives the engine's total displacement.
The formula is : *f.
Dimensions in inches, and fractions of inches will give the displacement in cubic inches.
Dimensions in centimeters and fractions of centimeters will give the displacement in cubic centimeters ( cc. ).
One inch equals 2.54 centimeters : one cubic inch equals 16.38 cubic centimeters.
For example, let's consider a standard 283 cubic inch Chevy *j.
These engines have a cylinder diameter of 3-7/8 inches and a stroke length of 3 inches.
The formula, with the fractions converted to decimals, becomes *f.
To arrive at the answer, multiply the numbers together by starting at the left of the group and working to the right.
The different steps will look like this : *f.
Compression ratio a cylinder's compression ratio is computed by comparing the cylinder's volume, or its displacement, with the total volume of the cylinder and its combustion chamber.
Cylinder volume can be determined mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measured with a liquid.
Cylinder volume is determined in exactly the same manner as for the displacement formula : *f.
To measure the volume of one of the combustion chambers in the cylinder head, install the valves and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that its gasket surface is level.
Then pour water or light oil from a graduated beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to its gasket surface.
Do not overfill the chamber.
This is possible with water and other liquids that have a high surface tension.
Such liquids will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber.
The amount of liquid poured into the chamber is determined by subtracting the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber is full from the original quantity.
Most beakers are graduated in cubic centimeters ( cc. ), making it necessary to convert the result to cubic inches.
However, the displacement of the cylinder can be converted to cubic centimeters.
The compression ratio arrived at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inches or cubic centimeters are used.
The only precaution is that all volumes used in the formula be quoted in the same terms.
The volume of the cylinder opening in the head gasket must be computed by multiplying its area in square inches by the gasket's thickness in thousandths of an inch.
Sometimes it is necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the opening but the calculation can usually be made with sufficient accuracy that it won't affect the final computation.
The volume of the opening is added to the combustion chamber volume.
Another thing that must be taken into consideration is the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston is in top dead center position.
Compute this volume by measuring the distance from the top of the block to the piston head as accurately as possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measuring device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth.
The formula for this step is : *f.
This volume is added to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket opening.
The total of these three volumes is the final combustion chamber volume.
After the factors just described have been computed, they are applied to the following formula : *f.
For an example let's dream up an engine that has a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inches and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inches.
Applying these figures to the formula we get the equation : *f.
The compression ratio is 10 to 1.
This method of computing compression ratio cannot be used accurately for engines that have pistons with either domed or irregularly shaped heads.
Any irregularity on the piston heads will make it impossible, with normal means, to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displaced by the piston heads cannot be readily computed.
The only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such pistons are used is by measuring it with liquid while the cylinder head is bolted to the cylinder block and the piston is in top dead center position.
Gear ratio -- speed relationships there are four versions of the formula that involves the relationships of car speed, engine speed, rear axle gear ratio, and rear tire size.
By using the appropriate version any one of these factors can be determined for any combination of the other three.
To simplify the formulas a representative symbol is substituted for each of the factors.
These are *j for car speed, *j for engine crankshaft speed, *j for rear axle gear ratio, *j for tire size.
Tire size can be determined in several ways but the one that is the easiest and as accurate as any is by measuring the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly.
This is done by measuring the distance from the surface on which the tire is resting to the center of the rear axle shaft.
A tire must be inflated to its normal hot operating pressure and the car must be loaded to its operating weight when this measurement is made.
The measurement must be in inches.
Any fraction of an inch involved in the measurement must be converted to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics.
When tire size is measured in this manner a constant of 168 is used in the formula.
To determine car speed for a given combination of engine speed, gear ratio, and tire size, the formula is : *f.
For an engine speed of 5000 *j, a gear ratio of 4.00 to 1, and a tire radius of 13 inches, the equation would look like this : *f.
To determine engine speed for a given combination of the other three factors the formula is : *f.
Using the same figures as for the previous example, the equation becomes : *f.
To determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factors, the formula is : *f.
Using the figures from the previous examples, the equation becomes : *f.
Orlando, Fla., Feb. 2 -- the best 2-year-old pacing mile up to date at Ben White Raceway has been that of Mary Liner ( Mainliner-*highland Ellen ), a member of the Dick Williams stable, who was clocked 2:25.
She is owned by Ralph H. Kroening, Milwaukee, Wis., who, according to the railbirds, can feel justly proud of her.
Other good miles have been by Debonnie ( Dale Frost-*debby Hanover ) and Prompt Time ( Adios-*on Time ) in 2:28-:36 ; Kimberly Gal ( Galophone-*kimberly Hanover ) 2:26.2 ; Laguerre Hanover ( Tar Heel-*lotus Hanover ) and Monel ( Tar Heel-*miracle Byrd ) in 2:34.
Laguerre Hanover is outstanding in type and conformation -- good body, plenty of heart girth, stands straight on his legs on excellent feet -- and has the smoothest gait.
This colt is behind most of the other 2-year-olds in the Simpson stable but can show about as much pace as any of them.
Monel shows improvement with each work-out and looks the makings of a good brood mare after winning her share of races.
Stardel ( Star's Pride-*starlette Hanover ), 2:34, looks quite promising.
Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-*fay ), Caper ( Hoot Mon-*columbia Hanover ) and Isaac ( Hoot Mon-*goddess Hanover ) has been working together but have not equalled their best work done some weeks ago.
Fury and Caper worked in 2:35 and did it with ease.
They are two good colts of different type.
Fury is upstanding and on the rangy side, and Caper is more the compact type.
I have never seen Caper off his feet -- he seems to know nothing but trot and keeps trying a little harder if asked to do so.
Fury has made a few mistakes but looks like a wonderful prospect, with his impressive gait and stride which certainly make him cover the ground.
Trackdown ( Torrid-*mighty Lady ) has worked a mile in 2:33.3.
It took this colt several weeks to strike a pace.
Then, after emasculation, he was eased up for a couple of weeks.
He has thrived on all he has gone through and looks the makings of a good little race horse.
Thor Hanover ( Adios-*trustful Hanover ) is a wonderful looking prospect and another good individual, with solid, rugged conformation, good, flat bone and excellent feet.
This colt arrived at the Raceway early last November, and immediately was put into harness and line-driven for a few days, and then put to cart and broken in very nicely, knowing nothing but trot.
He appeared in the hopples about November 14, was treated for worms on the 18th, the latter date being the first time he struck a real pace.
On December 5 he paced a mile in 55 on the twice-around, out in third position all the way.
This colt has done everything asked of him, and done it with ease.
His best mile to date is 2:32.2.
Gamecock ( Tar Heel-*terka Hanover ) is another promising colt, and his best time is 2:32.2.
This is one of the best-tempered Tar Heels ever at the center.
The first time he was harnessed he stood like a gentle old mare ; the crupper under his tail seemed to be old stuff.
The fourth time in harness he walked off like a gentleman.
Being blistered for curbs has delayed his work somewhat.
But up to date he has shown as much as any in the big Simpson stable.
Hustler ( Knight Dream-*torkin ) is a playful bay rascal of a colt, not the best gaited, but he surely can pace and is right there with them, and sometimes leading them, in the best miles.
Torrid Freight ( Torrid-*breeze On Hal ) is a very rugged, strong-made colt with a wonderful stride who has done with ease everything asked of him.
His best time is around 2:33.
Strongheart ( Adios-*direct Gal ), a fair-looking sorrel colt, knows nothing but pace and has been right there in the best miles.
Torrid Adios ( Torrid-*adios Molly ) is not so masculine as most of the colts, but I like his type and he certainly is one of the best-gaited pacers on the grounds.
Blistered for curbs and laid off three weeks, he is coming along fine and looks like a pacer to me.
First Flyer ( Frisco Flyer-*castle Light ) looks like a splendid candidate for the Illinois Stakes.
His best time is 2:33.2.
The colts in Simpson's stable have little if anything on the fillies, especially the pacers.
Justine Hanover ( Sampson Hanover-*justitia Hanover ) is improving with each work-out and paced 2:32.4 weeks ago.
Mrs. Freight ( Knight Dream-*miss Reed ) shows promise and does it in good form, and her best time is about 2:35.
Hoopla ( Tar Heel-*holiday Hanover ), a filly that wanted to trot, knocked herself October 31 and November 1 fighting the hopples.
She was then trained on the trot until December 29, hitched to a breaking cart once around the half-mile track and hoppled again.
This time she submitted and in a few days was going good.
On January 11 she paced a mile in 2:43.1--:38 ; on Jan. 18 2:37.3--:36.1 ; on Jan. 21, 2:36.
This filly is a much better individual than either of her full-sisters, Valentine Day and Cerise -- more scale and much better underpinning.
She is more like her full brother, Taraday Hanover, but larger.
Up to date she is a grand-looking filly.
Pete Dailey has four promising 2-year-old pacers.
Marquis Pick ( Gene Abbe-*direct Grattan ) seems to be the pick of the stable at the present time.
He is a fine-looking colt with a good body, good set of legs and nice way of going.
His best mile to date is 2:28-:33.
Majestic Pick comes next, with a mile in 2:30-:33.2.
This colt is another fine-looking equine.
Staley Hanover ( Knight Dream-*sweetmite Hanover ) is a little on the small side but a very compact colt and looks like one to stand training and many future battles with colts in his class.
Best time to date is 2:34-:34.
Step Aside ( Direct Rhythm-*wily Widow ) has worked in 2:32 on the half-mile track and shows promise.
Most of Billy Haughton's 2-year-olds have worked from 2:40 to 2:35.
Bonnie Wick ( Gene Abbe-*scotch Mary ) has gone in 2:36 ; Hickory Ash ( Titan Hanover-*misty Hanover ) in 2:35.
The first time I saw the latter filly she trotted by me and I noticed such a family resemblance that I said to myself, that must be Hickory Ash.
She is a beautiful filly and likes to trot.
Hickory Hill ( Star's Pride-*venus Hanover ) has gone in 2:33 ; Hickory Spark ( Harlan-*hickory Tiny ) 2:37 ; Buxton Hanover ( Tar Heel-*beryl Hanover ) 2:35 ; Faber's Kathy ( Faber Hanover-*ceyway ) 2:37 ; Honor Rodney ( Rodney-*honor Bright ) around 2:40.
The last-named is a fine-looking, large colt, who has been unfortunate to be laid off for some time due to injuries.
He is going sound again now, and looks good.
Brief Candle ( Harlan-*marcia ) has gone in 2:37 ; Lena Faber ( Faber Hanover-*chalidale Lena ) 2:33 ; Martha Rodney ( Rodney-*miss Martha D. ) 2:35 ; Checkit ( Faber Hanover-*supermarket ) 2:35 ; Charm Rodney ( Rodney-*the Charmer ) 2:37 ; Fair Sail ( Farvel-*topsy Herring ) 2:36 ; Custom Maid ( Knight Dream-*way Dream ) 2:34.2 ; Jacky Dares ( Meadow Gene-*princess Lorraine ) 2:36 ; Good Flying ( Good Time-*olivette Hanover ) 2:36 ; Bordner Hanover ( Tar Heel-*betty Mahone ) 2:34 ; Faber's Choice ( Faber Hanover-*sally Joe Whippet ) 2:36 ; Invercalt ( Florican-*inverness ) 2:35 ; Duffy Dares ( Meadow Gene-*princess Mite ) 2:36 ; Harold J.

The last-named is one of the favorites in the stable, and the boys like her very much.
I will be able to tell you more about this string of equines in the near future.
I have just seen Debonnie and Prompt Time work a mile in 2:34, last quarter in :35.3.
In going away Debonnie got behind several lengths, stalling at the start -- she is a little fussy.
They left the three-quarters together and finished almost together.
Prompt Time shows class.
This filly is another Adios that wants to trot, and trot she did until forced to do otherwise.
After well broken and equipped with 12-oz. shoes on behind, bare-footed in front, she would trot a real storm with the master, Delvin, driving.
Being placed in the hopples she was completely baffled.
She hesitated, she hopped, she rolled and rocked, skipped and jumped, but in some two weeks she started to pace, from that time to this she has shown steady improvement and now looks like one of the classiest things on the grounds.
Rain on Friday prevented many workouts, but there were a few miles of note on Thursday.
Those responsible included Stardel Hanover ( Star's Pride-*starlette Hanover ), 2:30-:34.3 ; Lorena Gallon ( Bill Gallon-*loren Hanover ), 2:30-:34.3 ; Prudent Hanover ( Dean Hanover-*precious Hanover ), 2:30.3-:35.3 ; Premium Freight ( Titan Hanover-*pebble Hanover ), 2:30.3-35.3 ; Laguerre Hanover ( Tar Heel-*lotus Hanover ), 2:30.3-:36.1 ; Monel ( Tar Heel-*miracle Byrd ), 2:30.3-:36.1 ; Fury Hanover ( Hoot Mon-*fay ), 2:30.3-:36 ; Isaac ( Hoot Mon-*goddess Hanover ), 2:30.3-:36 ; Caper ( Hoot Mon-*columbia Hanover ), 2:30.3-:36 ; Lucky Freight ( Knight Dream-*lusty Helen ), 2:31.3-:35.3.
Sam Caton's Butterwyn ( Scotch Victor-*butler Wyn ), a light bay filly, knows nothing but trot and has worked on the half-mile in 2:30-:36.
Riverboat ( Dalzell-*cousin Rachel ) has gone in 2:38.
Sam is having his troubles with Layton Hanover ( Dean Hanover-*lucy Hanover ), but hopes to have him straightened out and going before long.
Jimmy Jordon is high on Adios Scarlet ( Adios-*rena Grattan ) and she sure looks good as she goes by.
Her best time to date is about 2:30.
He also likes Hampton Hanover ( Titan Hanover-*bertie Hanover ) 2:37.
Cathy J. Hanover ( Tar Heel-*kaola Hanover ), formerly called Karet Hanover, has been rather a problem child, but is getting better all the while and can pace a twice around in about 2:31.
Armbro Comet ( Nibble Hanover-*mauri Hanover ) has been in 2:38.
Flick Nipe's and Neil Engle's Miss Phone ( Galophone-*prissy Miss ) is a fine-looking filly with good disposition and good gait, and she has worked up to date in 2:46.
Del Mar, Calif., Feb. 3 -- after 52 rainless days, moisture finally came to Del Mar, resulting in but one workout during the week for most of the horses, and leaving us with less than half our total average rainfall during the season.
While 2-year-olds are still gaining most of the attention at the track, green horses are starting to go a bit, and Jimmy Cruise has several that can really make it.
Work-outs for the week are as follows : Plain Scotch, 3 ( by Scotch Victor ), Demon Law, 3 ( by Demon Hanover ), Coffee Royal, *j ( by Royal Blackstone ) and Beauty Way, *j, 3 ( by Demon Hanover ) in 25 ; Eddie Duke, *j, 3 ( by Duke Of Lullwater ), Marilyn C., *j ( by Sampson Hanover ) and Chalidale Barry, 5 ( by King's Ransom ) in 2:20 ; Tiger Hanover, *j, 3 ( by Adios ) in 2:26 ; Sherwood Lass, 4 ( by Victory Song ) in 2:22 ; and Dauntless, 3 ( by Greentree Adios ) in 2:32.
For the aged horses : Mr. Budlong, *j, 2:00.2, Lottie Thomas, *j, 2:04.2, Mighty Signal 2:03, Clever Braden, *j, 2:01.1, and Glow Star, *j, 2:02.3 have been in 2:35 ; Miss Demon Abbe, *j, 1:59.3 has trotted in 2:26, and is expected to race at this gait ; Carter Creed, *j, 3, 2:01.1, Great Lullwater 2:00.3, and Hi Jay, *j, 2:05.1 have been in 2:30 ; Tanker T., 3, 2:05.3 is now wearing hopples and has trained in 2:19 ; Stormy Dream, *j, 2:01.3, Demon Abbe, *j, 2:02, Dundeen B., 4, 2:04.2, Claudia's Song, 3, 2:06.3, and ( Jet Fire, 4, 2:02.2 have been in 2:25 ; Maria Key, 2, 2:06 looked great in 2:22 ; Mocking Byrd, *j, 2:01.1 has been in 2:12, with a racing date approaching at Bay Meadows.
Dewey Urban has a clever green trotter in Dr. Orin I., 3 ( by Yankee Hanover ), his latest mile in 2:20 ; Victory Sun, *j, 2:04 has trained in 2:24 ; Early Sun, *j, 2:02.3, Chester Maid 2:05, Dark Sun, *j, 2:06.1, and Sun Tan Maid 2:05.2 have been in 2:21.
The average reader of this magazine owns more than one gun ( we ran a survey to find out ) but he's always on the lookout for new and better arms.
He's more than a reader of outdoor articles ; he's a real hunter and shooter, eager to improve his sport.
Well, if you're that kind of sportsman we're here to help you.
You've probably given a lot of Christmas-season thought to the guns in your rack, but it's not easy to decide on a new one.
You still have time to drop a few hints about the gifts you'd appreciate most ; the time to decide on them is now.
As a Christmas service, I've taken a close look at this year's crop of new models.
Here they are, with my comments and judgments.
Read on, take your pick -- and start dropping those hints.
First on my own list would be two arms -- a rifle and a handgun -- that qualify as new in the strictest sense.
For me, a changed barrel length or an improved stock doesn't constitute a truly new design.
Such modifications are all for the best but it takes something as different as a Deerstalker or a Jet to change arms-making concepts.
Bill Ruger's long-awaited Deerstalker ( under $110 ) is a new rifle action in a caliber that upsets all the modern theory of high-velocity fans ; it's a short, light, quick-handling, fast-firing little timber gun designed to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lots of killing power and ample range for our most popular big game -- whitetail.
Ruger reports that on his recent African safari the little.44
Magnum cartridge was a real work horse.
Small antelope were generally grassed with one shot, and the.44
Magnum carbine also bagged reedbuck, kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency ; these are fairly large, tough animals.
The deadliness of the.44
Magnum in a rifle comes as no surprise to me.
At least five years ago, Tom Robinson of Marlin made up an over/under double rifle for me in this caliber, using the now defunct Model 90 action in 20-gauge size.
After figuring out how to regulate the barrels so that they shot to the same point of impact, we fired this little 20-inch-barrel job on my home range and in Marlin's underground test gallery.
We quickly ran into the same trouble that plagued Bill Ruger in his first experiments : three or four bullets would be placed well in a six-inch bull at 100 yards and then, unaccountably, one could stray far out of the group.
Ruger learned that this was because the higher velocity achieved in a long barrel was upsetting the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet.
The new, jacketed slug in.44
Magnum corrected this.
But even without jacketed bullets, I had enough faith in my double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year.
Within half an hour I jumped a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket, and I caught him just behind the left foreleg at 60 yards.
He moved only about 30 feet after the 240-grain slug hit him -- and this was after the bullet had passed through a sapling.
Three more deer have fallen to this same gun, and all were one-shot kills.
My double was made with standard-weight revolver barrels ( before cutting to revolver length ), and although it compares well in other respects, it's considerably heavier than the Deerstalker, which only scales about 6-1/2 pounds.
If ever a rifle met the needs of the whitetail hunter, this is it.
The Deerstalker points with the ease, speed and precision of a fine imported double shotgun, and its trigger pull is light and sharp.
The 240-grain bullet leaves the muzzle at 1,850 *j, which gives it all the smash needed at woods ranges.
With five shots at the immediate command of the hunter's trigger finger, the gun and load are a deadly combination.
The second really new development this year was a revolver handling a different sort of varmint load -- the.22
Remington Jet Magnum Center Fire.
At present it's available in one model, the fine and familiar Smith & Wesson Magnum revolver ( about $110 ), long a top-quality handgun among target arms.
The velocity of this.22-CALIBER
, 40-grain bullet is rated at a very hot 2,460 *j, and it's the flattest shooting of any revolver cartridge, with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range.
This is a varmint load, pure and simple ; it's much too explosive for small edible game.
It can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feathers.
The most intriguing aspect of the S & W Magnum chambered for the new Jet is that it can also fire standard.22
Rim-fires by means of adapter sleeves in the chambers.
You may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm, although the difference in the point of impact ( Jet vs. rim-fire ) can be somewhat disconcerting.
The accuracy of the Jet cartridge is fine ; I tested it in my scoped S & W and it was good enough to allow me to hit a chuck with every shot at 100 yards if I did my part by holding the handgun steadily.
Hunting rifles, '61 the fact that the Deerstalker and the Jet were the only completely new designs this year doesn't mean that 1961 didn't see changes in models, actions and calibers.
Aside from the Ruger carbine, a number of hunting rifles have been introduced for the first time.
Here are the brands ( in alphabetical order ) and the new models.
Newcomers to the American hunter are the Browning group of bolt-action, high-power rifles.
They have fine *j actions and a better-than-average finish on both the metal and the stock wood.
Barrel weights vary sensibly with the various calibers available, and these include the standard bores ( about $165 ) plus the Magnums ( around $170 ) ; the latter include the.264
,.300
S & H,.338
,.375
And.458
.
Shotgun-type rubber recoil pads are standard on all of the Magnums except the.264
.
Stock designs are excellent for use with scopes.
Colt's center-fire 1961 rifles are all made with Sako actions, regardless of caliber.
The.222'S
Have the short action ; the.243
And.308
, the medium action, and the.270
, *f and the Magnums, the long action ( about $135 for the Standard Coltsman and $200 for the Custom version ).
Previously, *j actions were used for the larger cartridges.
High Standard has introduced a.22
Auto, the Sport-*king, in two grades -- field and special ( less than $45 and just over $45, respectively ).
It's a streamlined rifle, fast and well-made.
Among.22
Magnum Rim-*fire rifles, 1961's lone newcomer was the Kodiak Model 260 autoloader ( around $60 ).
Previously known as Jefferson Arms, Kodiak has given this 11-shot hammerless job an exceptionally fine stock design, and the 260 is the first autoloader to handle.22
Magnum rim-fires.
Marlin has made two contributions to the harvest of new offerings.
The Model 99 ( under $45 ) is a light-weight, streamlined.22
Rim-fire auto with a tubular magazine that holds 18 Long Rifles.
It's extremely accurate for an auto, and the test rifle I tried was completely trouble-free in functioning.
The 989 ( about $40 ) is an even newer.22
Auto, this one with a seven- or 12-shot clip.
Once again the Mossberg Targo outfit has appeared, but this time as a bolt-action rifle-shotgun combination.
The bore is unrifled but is provided with an insert tube which is rifled and which, surprisingly, gives pretty fair accuracy even though it's only 3-1/2 inches long.
You can unscrew this tube and replace it with a smoothbore insert for use with.22
Shotshells -- to break the little Targo clay targets.
A trap for throwing these miniature clays fastens to the barrel so that the shooter can throw his own targets.
A spring trap for solid mounting and a regular hand trap are also available.
You can have your choice of a seven-shot repeater, the *j ( about $40 ) or a single-shot, the *j ( $10 less ).
The Targo is a good outfit for fun shooting or for economic wing-shooting practice, but it's tougher than it looks to run up a score on the clay birds.
They'll travel 50 feet or more when thrown from the spring trap but it's almost impossible to break one after it passes the 35-foot mark.
The combination of thin pattern and very tiny pellets makes it necessary to get on the birds, right now ] big Magnum calibers appeared in the Remington line for 1961, with the addition of the.375
And.458
To the list of Model 725's.
These are made on special order only, in Kodiak grade ( about $310 ), with integral muzzle brakes and heavy rubber recoil pads ; they weigh around nine pounds.
A shortened version of the highly regarded Remington 742 autoloader also appeared in 1961.
This carbine ( under $140, about $15 more for a deluxe grade ) has an 18-1/2-inch barrel and was obviously inspired by the popularity of last year's Model 760 pump with a short-barrel.
This design is hard to beat for timber hunting or for packing in a saddle scabbard.
Presently, the *j is available in *f.
The latest versions of the famous Savage Model 99 are the 99 Featherweight ( about $125 ) and the 99 Deluxe ( under $135 ), which have a top-tang safety and improved trigger design.
The replacement of the slide-lock side safety catch will make this lever-action favorite more appealing than ever since the new safety is easier and faster to operate.
Beginners' guns, '61 a fresh crop of beginners' guns showed up in 1961, and they're good bets for your Christmas gift list if you're wondering what to get for a youngster.
The most unusual of them is the Ithaca 49 ( about $20, $5 for a saddle scabbard ) -- a lever-action single-shot patterned after the famous Winchester lever-action and featuring the Western look.
Because of its traditional lines, it probably has more kid appeal than any other model.
The action is a drop-block, handling all the standard.22
Rim-fires.
Marlin's latest is also designed for the beginning shooter, although it's a full-sized rifle with plenty of barrel weight and ample stock.
This is the Model 122 ( about $20 ) ; it's a single-shot bolt-action with an automatic safety -- i.e., the safety goes on every time the bolt is lifted and the gun cocked for the next shot.
Stock design is excellent, and this model is a good first gun.
Another boy's model is the.22
Single-shot Remington *j ( around $20 ), which comes with a 21-inch barrel and a short -- 12-1/2-inch -- stock ; it's just right for a boy of 12-1/2.
A beginner's shotgun has also been introduced this year.
The single-barrel Stevens *j ( under $35 ) is made with a side lever rather than a top-tang lever because many youngsters aren't strong enough to operate a top tang to open a gun -- and the side lever does indeed open very easily.
This gun has a 12-1/2-inch stock and is available in either 20 or.410
Gauge.
There's another addition to the Stevens line, the pump-action Model 77 in.410
( under $75 ), which you may or may not consider a kid's gun ; many experienced hunters like this gauge and type of scattergun too.
Shotguns, '61 although there were no startling developments in shotgun design this year, a number of new models and variations of existing models did hit the market.
For example, a Browning trap version of the Superposed over/under, the Broadway ( from $350 up, depending on grade ), differs from standard models in that it is equipped with a full beavertail fore end, a cushion recoil pad and a barrel-wide ventilated rib for fast sighting.
The Colt line now includes a new scattergun, the Standard or Custom Pump Model ( about $90 and $150, respectively ) in 12, 16 and 20.
Firearms International has introduced another import, this one from Finland.
It's the Valmet ( about $170 ), a 12-gauge over/under very much like the old Remington 32 -- which was so fine a gun that today a used one still brings high prices.
High Standard has also added two models to its line.
The Supermatic Trophy ( prices begin at less than $135 and depend on grade and optional features ) is a 12-gauge auto.
The Flite-*king Trophy ( beginning at just over $85 ) is a pump gun in 12 or 16.
Either model is a very good dollar value.
Mossberg's latest contribution to the field is the Model 500 ( from $73.50 ) ; this is an improved version of the old Model 200, a pump-action 12-gauge shotgun.
See page 24 for a complete report on it.
Handguns, '61 aside from the.22
Jet -- which I coupled with the Deerstalker carbine as one of the year's two biggest developments -- few significant innovations appeared among 1961's handguns.
Livery stable -- J. Vernon, prop..
Coaching had declined considerably by 1905, but the sign was still there, near the old Wells Fargo building in San Francisco, creaking in the fog as it had for thirty years.
John Vernon had had all the patronage he cared for -- he had prospered, but he could not retire from horsedom.
Coaching was in his blood.
He had two interests in life : the pleasures of the table and driving.
Twice a week he drove his tallyho over the Santa Cruz road, upland and through the redwood forest, with orchards below him at one hand, and glimpses of the Pacific at the other.
The journey back he made along the coast road, traveling hell-for-leather, every lantern of the tallyho ablaze.
The southward route was the classic run in California, and the most fashionable.
His patronage on this stretch was made up largely of San Franciscans -- regulars, most of them, and trenchermen like himself.
They did not complain at the inhuman hour of starting ( seven in the morning ), nor of the tariff, which was reasonable since it covered everything but the tobacco.
Breakfast was at the Palace Hotel, luncheon was somewhere in the mountain forest, and dinner was either at Boulder Creek or at Santa Cruz.
Gazing too long at the scenery could be tiring, so halts were contrived between meals.
Then the Chinese hostler, who rode with Vernon on the box, would break open a hamper and produce filets of smoked bass or sturgeon, sandwiches, pickled eggs, and a rum sangaree to be heated over a spirit lamp.
In spring and in autumn the run was made for a group of botanists which included an old friend of mine.
They gathered roots, bulbs, odd ferns, leaves, and bits of resin from the rare Santa Lucia fir, which exists only on a forty-five mile strip on the westerly side of these mountains.
In the Spanish days Franciscan monks roamed here to collect the resin for incense.
It yields a fragrance as Orphic as that of the pastilles of Malabar.
Vernon was serviceable on the botanical field trips, but he could arrange no schedule with the cooks, and he was glad when the trips dropped off, and the botanists began to motor out by themselves.
My friend often breakfasted with Vernon on the morning of the regular tallyho run.
This was an honor, like dining with a captain at his private table.
Vernon's office adjoined the stable, and the walls were adorned with brightly colored lithographs, the folk art of the period.
They advertised harness polish, liniments, Ball's Rubber Boots, Green River Whiskey, Hood's Sarsaparilla, patent medicines, shoe blacking, and chewing tobacco.
The hostler would have the table ready and a pot of coffee hissing on the stove ; then a porter from Manning's Fish House would trot in with a tray on his head.
It was draped with snowy napkins that kept hot a platter of oyster salt roast and a mound of corn fritters.
Vernon was consummately fond of oysters, and Manning's had been famous for them since the Civil War.
Oyster salt roast -- oysters on the half shell, cooked on a bed of coarse salt that kept them hot when served -- was a standby at Manning's.
Its early morning patrons were coachmen, who fortified themselves for the day with that delicacy.
In the 1890's the Palace Hotel began serving an oyster dish named after its manager, John C. Kirkpatrick.
This dish much resembles the oysters Rockefeller made famous by Antoine's in New Orleans, though the Palace chef announced it as a variant of Manning's roast oysters.
( gastronomes have long argued about which came first, the Palace's or Antoine's.
Antoine's held as mandatory a splash of absinthe or Pernod on the parsley or spinach which was used for the underbedding.
The Kirkpatrick version holds liqueur as optional.
) Vernon, however, held out for plain oyster roast, and plenty of it, unadorned by herbs or any seasoning but salt, though he did fancy a bit of lemon.
After the meal, he and his guests went out to inspect the rig ; this was merely a ritual, to please all hands concerned.
The tallyho had cost Vernon $2,300.
A replica of two coaches made in England for the Belmont Club in the East, and matchless west of the Rockies, it was the despair of whips on the Santa Cruz run.
One could shave in the reflection of its French-polished panels, and its axles were greased like those of roulette wheels.
The horses were groomed to a high gloss ; departing, they stepped solemnly with knees lifted to the jaw, for they had been trained to drag at important funerals.
But for the start of the Santa Cruz run, the whip fell.
The clients boarded the tallyho at the Palace promptly at seven.
They had been fed a hunting breakfast, so called because a kedgeree, the dish identified with fox hunting, was on the bill.
There are many ways of making a kedgeree, every one of which is right.
Here is an original kedgeree recipe from the Family Club's kitchen : Club Kedgeree flake ( for three ) a cupful of cold boiled haddock, mix with a cupful of cooked rice, two minced hard-boiled eggs, some buttery white sauce done with cream, cayenne, pepper, salt, a pinch of curry, a tablespoonful of minced onion fried, and a bit of anchovy.
Heat and serve hot on toast.
The omelet named for Ernest Arbogast, the Palace's chef, was even more in demand.
For decades it was the most popular dish served in the Ladies' Grill at breakfast, and it is one of the few old Palace dishes that still survive.
Native California oysters, salty and piquant, as coppery as Delawares and not much larger than a five-cent piece, went into it.
The original formula goes thus : a tablespoonful omelet Arbogast fry in butter a small minced onion, rub with of flour, add half a cup of cream, six beaten eggs, pepper, celery salt, a teaspoonful of minced chives, a dash of cayenne, and a pinch of nutmeg.
A jigger of dry Sherry follows, and as the mixture stiffens, in go a hundred of the little oysters.
Louis Sherry once stayed a fortnight at the Palace, and he was so pleased with omelet Arbogast that he introduced it at his restaurant in New York J. Pierpont Morgan had come in his private train to San Francisco, to attend an Episcopal convention, and brought the restaurateur with him.
As things happened, Morgan was installed in the Nob Hill residence of a magnate friend, whose kitchen swarmed with cooks of approved talent.
Sherry remained in his hotel suite, where he amused himself as best he could.
Twice he left everything to his entourage, and fled to make the Santa Cruz tour under Vernon's guidance.
In the grand court of the Palace, notable for its tiers of Moorish galleries that looked down on the maelstrom of vehicles below, Vernon's station was at the entrance.
It was a post of honor, held inviolate for him ; he had the primacy among the coachmen.
Of majestic build, rubicund and slash-mouthed, he resembled the late General Winfield Scott, who was said to be the most imposing general of his century, if not of all centuries.
Vernon wore a gray tall hat, a gardenia, and maroon Wellington boots that glistened like currant jelly.
Promptly at seven he would clatter out of the court with twelve in the tallyho.
He had style : he held his reins in a loose bunch at the third button of his checked Epsom surtout, and when the horses leaned at a curve, as if bent by the force of a gale, he leaned with them.
They cantered down the peninsula, not slackening until the coach reached Woodside where the Santa Cruz uplands begin.
The road maps of the region have changed since 1905 ; inns have burned down, moved elsewhere, or taken other names.
Once on the road ( and especially if the passengers were all regulars and masculine ), the schedule meant nothing.
An agreeable ease suffused Vernon and the passengers of the tallyho, from which there issued clouds of smoke.
Vernon would tilt his hat over one ear as he lounged with his feet on the dashboard, indulging in a huge cigar.
The horses moved at a clump ; they were no more on parade than was their driver ; one fork of the road was as good as another.
The Santa Cruz mountains sprawl over three counties, and the roads twist through sky-tapping redwoods down whose furrowed columns ripple streams of rain, even when heat bakes the Santa Clara valley below at the left.
The water splashes into shoulder-high tracts of fernery.
You arrive there in seersucker, and feel you were half-witted not to bring a mackintosh.
Vernon kept an account book with a list of all the establishments that he thought worthy of patronage.
A number of them must have fallen into disfavor ; they were struck out with remarks in red ink, denouncing both the cooks and the management.
He was copious in his praise of those that served food that was good to eat.
The horses seemed to know these by instinct, he used to say : such places invariably had stables with superior feed bins.
There was Wright's, for one, lost amongst trees, its wide verandas strewn with rockers.
Many of its sojourners were devoted to seclusion and quiet, and lived there to the end of their days.
It was the haunt of writer Ambrose Bierce, who admired its redwoods.
Acorns from the great oaks fed the small black pigs ( akin to Berkshires ), whose carcass sweepstakes were renowned.
Their ham butts, cured in oak-log smoke, were also esteemed when roasted or boiled, and served with this original sauce : Wright's devil sauce ; put into a saucepan a cupful of the baked ham gravy, or of the boiled ham liquor, with a half stick of butter, three teaspoonfuls of made mustard, and two mashed garlic cloves.
Contribute also an onion, a peeled tomato and two pickled gherkins, and a mashed lime.
After this has simmered an hour, add two tablespoons each of Worcestershire, catsup, and chutney, two pickled walnuts, and a pint of Sherry.
Then simmer fifteen minutes longer.
Every winter a kegful of this sauce was made and placed at the end of a row of four other kegs in the cellar, so that when its turn came, it was properly mellowed.
Vineyards and orchards also grew around Wright's, and deer were rather a nuisance ; they leaped six-foot fences with the agility of panthers.
But no one complained when they wound up, regardless of season, in venison pies.
No one complained of the white wine either : at this altitude of two thousand feet, grapes acquire a dryness and the tang of gunflint.
( the Almaden vineyards have now climbed to this height.
) apple trees grew there also.
Though creeks in the Santa Cruz mountains flow brimful the year round and it is forever spring, the apples that grow there have a wintry crackle.
Dwellers thereabouts preferred to get their apple pies at the local bakery, which had a brick oven fired with redwood billets.
The merit of the pie, Vernon believed, was due more to its making than to the waning heat of the oven.
The recipe, which he got from the baker, and wrote down in his ledger, is basically this : Wright's apple pie ; peel, core, and slice across enough apples to make a dome in the pie tin, and set aside.
In a saucepan put sufficient water to cover them, an equal amount of sugar, a sliced lemon, a tablespoonful of apricot preserve or jam, a pinch each of clove and nutmeg, and a large bay leaf.
Let this boil gently for twenty minutes, then strain.
Poach the apples in this syrup for twelve minutes, drain them, and cool.
Set the apples in the pastry-lined tin, spread over them three tablespoonfuls of softened butter, with as much brown sugar, a sprinkling of nutmeg, and a fresh bay leaf, then lay on a cover of pastry, and gild it with beaten yolk of egg.
Those who have never traveled the width and length of this land cannot conceive, on the basis of textbook description alone, the overwhelming space and variety of this country held together under one government.
The miracle of democratic America comes home to one most strongly only when one has seen the endless Great Plains of the Midwest ; the sky-reaching peaks of the Northwest mountains ; the smoke-filled, art-filled, drama-filled life of the great cities of the East ; the lush and historic charm of the South.

Around New England, you'll no doubt want a color shot of one of the picturesque lighthouses.
Be careful here not to overexpose this subject since they are extremely bright and light-reflecting.
In color, 1/50th of a second between *f and *f will do for bright, frontal sunlight.
The South the southern United States, extending from Florida in the east to Texas in the west, still maintains its unique flavor of gracious living and historical elegance.
It encompasses in its expanse areas where the natural beauty encourages a vacation of quiet contemplation, on the one hand, to places where entertainment and spectacles of all sorts have been provided for the tourist with camera.

Gatlinburg, Tennessee, is the center of this area.
Another scenic spot in Tennessee is Chattanooga where the Rock City Gardens are not to be missed.
Beautiful homes and gardens are trademarks of the South and cities particularly noted for them are Charleston, S.*c., Natchez, Miss., and Savannah, Ga..
At Charlottesville, Va., shoot Monticello and the beautiful buildings of the University.
Picturing the south foliage is the outstanding photo subject in many of the Southern locales mentioned above and some specific tips on how and where to shoot it are in order.
For example, the Chamber of Commerce of Gatlinburg, Tennessee, sponsors special camera tours into the Great Smoky Mountains to get pictures of the profusion of wild flowers flourishing in these wooded regions.
Exposure problems may occur in these forest areas where uneven lighting results from shafts of sunlight filtering through the overhead branches.
Best solution is to find an area that is predominantly sunlight or shade.
In any instance, you should determine the exposure according to the type of light which falls on most of the subject area.
Try some closeups on Southern blossoms to provide a welcome contrast with the many long-view scenics you'll be making.
For shooting the interiors of the famous ante-bellum Southern mansions make sure your equipment includes a tripod.
Enough daylight is usually available from the windows, but if you have synchronized flash -- use it.

Peak action photography is your goal at Miami's Seaquarium and the Cypress Gardens waterskiing events.
The Midwest a pleasant start to your midwestern vacation is a few days spent in cosmopolitan Chicago.
Lake Michigan offers swimming and pictures which combine cityscapes with beaches.
A visit to Chicago's museums and a stroll around broad Michigan Avenue will unfold many photogenic subjects to the alert photographer.
Wisconsin Dells, where fantastically scenic rocks carved by the Wisconsin River are overgrown with fern and other foliage, rates a stopover when traveling from Chicago.
The farmlands forming the heart of America stretch out across the Midwest from Chicago.
In North Dakota the strangely beautiful Badlands will challenge you to translate its wonder on to film.

Of current interest is Abilene, Kansas, the birthplace of ex-*president Eisenhower.
There's a museum here and also Old Abilene Town, a reconstruction of the cattle boomtown of the 70's and 80's.
For a resort area, Mackinack Island, Michigan, is the place to visit.
It truly relives another age for the inhabitants use carriages rather than autos and old British and French forts are left intact for tourists to visit and record.
Pictures of the Midwest night scenes will add an exciting touch to your vacation travelogue and what better place to take them then along Chicago's Lake Shore Drive?
Just after sunset is a good time to record the city lights in color since you get a fill-in light from the sky.
Another memo for sightseers : bring your camera along to museums.
Photos of historic dioramas of the area you visit will add depth and background to your vacation photo story.
Again, be sure your tripod is handy for those sometimes-necessary time exposures.

The West a western vacation is practically synonymous with a visit to at least one of the magnificent national parks in this area.
A tour of several of them is possible in a two-week vacation while a stay at just one of these natural beauty spots can be of equal reward.
In California is located one of the most popular of the national parks -- Yosemite.
Among its most spectacular features are its falls, the highest being Upper Yosemite which drops 2,425 feet.
The Sequoia Grove presents another unique aspect of Yosemite, for these ancient giant trees are a sight never to be forgotten.
In the Utah area are Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon National Park.
Fantastic colors are to be seen in the fanciful formations of eroded rock which loom out of the semiarid country in both parks.
Colorado's Grand Canyon, probably the most famous landmark of the United States, can be the highpoint of your Western vacation.
Built upon seven hills, Istanbul, like Rome, is one of the most ancient cities in the world, filled with splendor and contrast.
It is an exotic place, so different from the ordinary that the casual tourist is likely to see at first only the contrast and the ugliness of narrow streets lined with haphazard houses.
At the moment, many of these are being pulled down.
Whole blocks are disappearing and more are scheduled to vanish to make room for wide boulevards that will show off its treasures to better advantage -- the great domes and graceful spires of its mosques, the panorama of the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn.
Even when they are finished, however, the contrast will remain, for Istanbul is the only city in the world that is built upon two continents.
For almost 3,000 years Europe and Asia have rubbed shoulders in its streets.
Founded in the Ninth Century B.*c. it was called Byzantium 200 years later when Byzas, ruler of the Megarians, expanded the settlement and named it after himself.
About a thousand years after that, when the Roman Empire was divided, it became capital of the Eastern section.
On May 11,330 A.*d., its name was changed again, this time to Constantinople after its emperor, Constantine.
In 1453 when the last vestige of ancient Roman power fell to the Turks, the city officially shifted religions -- although the Patriarch, or Pope, of the Orthodox Church continued to live there, and still does -- and became the capital of the Ottoman Empire.
When that was broken up after the First World War, its name was changed once more.
Rich in Christian and Moslem art, Istanbul is today a fascinating museum of East and West that recently became a seaside resort as well with the development of new beaches on the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara only a short distance from the center of town.
Easy to get to, and becoming more popular every year, it is only fourteen hours from New York by Pan American World Airways jet, four hours from Rome.
Start of tour most of the sights lie in the old section across the Golden Horn from the modern hotels.
I started my tour of them at the Turkish Government Tourist Office, next to Pan American's office on the left as you enter the driveway that leads to the Hilton Hotel.
From there I turned left along Cumhuriyet Cadesi past more hotels and a park on the left, Republic Gardens, and came in a few moments to Taksim Square, one of the hubs of the city, with the Monument of the Republic, erected in 1928, in its center.
Directly across from the Gardens I found a bus stop sign for *j 4 and rode it down to the Bosphorus, with the sports center on my left just before I reached the water and the entrance to Dolmabahce Palace immediately after that.
There the bus turned right along the Bosphorus, past ocean liners at anchor, to Galata Bridge over the entrance to the Golden Horn, a brown sweep of water that empties into the Bosphorus.
Across the bridge on the left I saw St. Sophia with its sturdy brown minarets and to the right of them the slenderer spires of the Blue Mosque.
On the other side of the Golden Horn I rode through Eminonu Square, with Yeni Cami, or the New Mosque, which dates from the Seventeenth Century, just across from the entrance to the bridge.
Passing it, the bus climbed a hill, with the covered spice bazaar on the right and Pandelli's, a famous and excellent restaurant, above it.
At the top of the hill the buildings on the left gave way to a park.
I got off there, crossed the street, walked ahead with St. Sophia on my left, the Blue Mosque on my right, and in a moment came to the entrance of St. Sophia.
Erected on the site of pagan temples and three previous St. Sophias, the first of which was begun by Constantine, this fourth church was started by Justinian in 532 and completed twenty years later.
On his first trip to the finished structure he boasted that he had built a temple grander than Solomon's in Jerusalem.
A few years later the dome fell in.
Nevertheless, it remained one of the most splendid churches of the Eastern Empire, where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned.
After the Turks conquered the city in 1453 they converted it to a mosque, adding the stubby minarets.
In the second half of the Sixteenth Century, Sinan, the great architect who is the Michelangelo of the East, designed the massive buttresses that now help support the dome.
With the birth of the Turkish Republic after the First World War, St. Sophia became a museum, and the ancient mosaics, which were plastered over by the Moslems, whose religion forbids pictures in holy places, have been restored.
Inside over the first door I saw one of these, which shows Constantine offering the city to the Virgin Mary and Justinian offering the temple.
On the columns around the immense dome are round plaques with Arabic writing.
The eight green columns, I learned, came from the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, the others, red, from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis.
Beneath the dome I saw the spot where the Byzantine Emperors were crowned, a bit of floor protected now by a wooden fence.
Behind this is a minber or Moslem pulpit and near it a raised platform with golden grillwork, where the emperors and, after them, the sultans, sat.
Directly opposite is the emperor's door, through which they entered the building.
Outside St. Sophia I walked through the flower garden in front of it, with the Blue Mosque ahead on my left.
Across the street on my right I saw the Hippodrome, now a park.
It was laid out in 196 for chariot races and other public games.
Statues and other monuments that stood there were stolen, mostly by the waves of Crusaders.
At the beginning of the Hippodrome I saw the Kaiser's Fountain, an ugly octagonal building with a glass dome, built in 1895 by the German Emperor, and on my left, directly across from it, the tomb of Sultan Ahmet, who constructed the Blue Mosque, more properly known by his name.
Just before coming to the mosque entrance I crossed the street, entered the Hippodrome, and walked ahead to the Obelisk of Theodosius, originally erected in Heliopolis in Egypt about 1,600 B.*c. by Thutmose, who also built those now in New York, London and Rome at the Lateran.
This one was set up here in 390 A.*d. on a pedestal, the faces of which are carved with statues of the emperor and his family watching games in the Hippodrome, done so realistically that the obelisk itself is included in them.
Beyond it I noted a small green column, about twelve feet below the present ground level -- the Serpentine Column, three entwined serpents, which once stood at the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, Greece.
Near the end of the Hippodrome I came upon the Built Column, a truncated obelisk of blocks, all that remains of a monument that once rivalled the Colossus of Rhodes.
Magnificent Mosque retracing my steps to the Mosque of Sultan Ahmet, only one with six minarets, I entered the courtyard, with a gallery supported by pointed arches running around it and a fountain in the middle.
One of the most beautiful buildings in Istanbul, it was constructed in the early years of the Seventeenth Century, with a huge central dome, two half domes that seem to cascade down from it, and smaller full domes around the gallery.
The round minarets, tall and graceful, rise from rectangular bases and have three platforms from which the muezzin can chant his call to prayer.
Inside, the walls are covered with blue and white tile, the floor with red and cream carpets.
Back at the Kaiser's Fountain, I walked left to the streetcar stop and rode up the hill -- any car will do -- past the Column of Constantine, also known as the Burnt Column, at the top on my right.
It stands in the middle of what was once the Forum of Constantine, who brought it from Rome.
I stayed on the car for a few minutes until, turning right, it entered a huge square, Bayezit, with the Bayezit Mosque on the right and the gate to the university just beyond it.
There I got off, crossed the square, and on the side directly opposite the gate found a good restaurant, hard to come by in this part of the city.
Called the Marmara Gazinosu, it is on the third floor, with signs pointing the way there, and has a terrace overlooking the Sea of Marmara.
After lunch, in the arcade on my left just before reaching the street I found a pastry shop that sells some of the best baklava -- a sweet, flaky cake -- in Istanbul.
It's a great favorite of the university students, and I joined them there for dessert.
Taking the streetcar back to Kaiser's Fountain, I walked ahead, then left down the street opposite St. Sophia and just beyond the corner came to a small, one-story building with a red-tile roof, which is the entrance to the Sunken Palace.
Actually an underground cistern, its roof supported by rows and rows of pillars, it was built by Justinian in the Sixth Century to supply the palace with water.
There is still water in it.
I found it fairly depressing and emerged almost immediately.
Outside I walked past the entrance to St. Sophia, turned left at the end of it, and continued toward a gate in the wall ahead.
Just before reaching it I came to a grey and brown stone building that looks somewhat like an Oriental pagoda, with Arabic lettering in gold and colored tile decorations -- the Fountain of Sultan Ahmet.
Going through the Imperial Gate in the wall, I entered the grounds of Topkapi Palace, home of the Sultans and nerve center of the vast Ottoman Empire, and walked along a road toward another gate in the distance, past the Church of St. Irene, completed by Constantine in 330 A.*d. on my left, and then, just outside the second gate, I saw a spring with a tap in the wall on my right -- the Executioner's Spring, where he washed his hands and his sword after beheading his victims.
Passing through the gate, with towers on either side once used as prisons, I entered a huge square surrounded by buildings, and on the wall to my right found a general plan of the grounds, with explanations in English for each building.
There are a good many of them.
At one time about 10,000 people lived there.
Following arrowed signs, I veered right toward the former kitchens, complete with chimneys, which now house one of the world's greatest collections of Chinese porcelain and a fabulous array of silver dinner services.
Next to it is a copper section, with cooking utensils and a figure of the chief cook in an elaborate, floor-length robe.
In the court once more, I went right toward the Reception House, a long one-story building with a deep portico.
Going through a door into another small court, I had the Throne Room directly in front.
I walked to the right around it to buildings containing illuminated manuscripts and came to the Treasury, which houses such things as coffee cups covered with diamonds, jewelled swords, rifles glittering with diamonds and huge divan-like thrones as large as small beds, on which the sultans sat cross-legged.
They are made of gold and covered with emeralds, pearls and other jewels.
Taking the path behind the Throne Room to the building directly beyond it, the Portrait Gallery, I went right at the end of it, through a garden to a small building at the back -- a sitting room furnished with low blue divans, its floor covered with carpets, its ceiling painted with gold squares and floral designs.
( do start fires one or two hours ahead of time to obtain a lasting bed of glowing coals.
Keep ashes from one barbecue to the next to sprinkle over coals if they are too hot, and to stop flames that arise from melting grease.
Do line barbecue fire bowl with heavy foil to reflect heat.
Don't forget to buy a plastic pastry brush for basting with sauces.
Clean it meticulously in boiling water and detergent, rinse thoroughly.
Do build a wall of glowing coals six to eight inches in front of meat that is barbecued on an electric spit.
Make use of the back of the barbecue or of the hood for heating vegetables, sauces and such.
Don't fail to shorten cooking time by the use of aluminum foil cut slightly larger than the surface of steaks and chops.
Sear on both sides then cover meat loosely with heat reflecting foil for juiciest results.
Do avoid puncturing or cutting into meats to test them.
If doubtful about a steak, boldly cut it in half.
If necessary to replace both halves on grill, sear cuts and allot extra time.
For roasts, insert meat thermometer diagonally so it does not rest on bone.
Also make sure thermometer does not touch the revolving spit or hit the coals.
Don't practice a new recipe on guests.
Have a test-run on the family first, to be sure timing and seasoning are right.
Do buy meat the day or the day before you intend to cook it.
Keep it no longer than 36 hours before cooking, and keep it in the coldest ( but non-freezing ) compartment of the refrigerator.
Don't plan meals that are too complicated.
Limit yourself to good meat and drink, with bread, salad, corn or potatoes as accessories.
Keep the desserts simple ; fruit does nicely.
Do whatever kitchen work, such as fixing a salad, preparing garlic bread, or making a marinade sauce, ahead of time.
When you start the outdoor performance, you can stay outdoors without a dozen running trips into the kitchen.
( this goes for getting a drink tray ready, and for having a big cooler full of ice on hand long before the party begins.
) don't think you have to start with the most expensive equipment in the world.
The simplest grill ( pan type ) or inexpensive hibachi can make you a chef.
You need tongs to handle meat ; long forks for turning potatoes and corn ; heavy foil on hand at all times.
And lots of hot pads ] do keep the grill high enough above the fire so that when fat from meat drips down and flares up, flames cannot reach the meat.
Don't forget to have a supply of Melamine plates, bowls, cups, saucers, and platters for outdoor use.
Made of the world's toughest unbreakable plastic, Melamine dinnerware comes in almost 400 different patterns and dozens of colors.
There is even one set that has barbecue written on it.
Do without fancy tablecloths.
It's cheaper to buy Wall-*tex and cover your outdoor table.
Or buy half a dozen lengths of oilcloth and change patterns for different kinds of barbecues.
Oilcloth only costs about 79-cents a yard for the very best.
Tougher than plastic, it wears well.
Don't forget -- when you take to the hills or the beach -- that your cooler, which you might have used for wine- or beer-cooling on your terrace or back yard, is indispensable for carrying liquid refreshments.
There are many varieties of coolers and they serve many purposes.
With them, you can carry steaks and hamburgers at refrigerator temperatures, and also get your frozen food for stews and chowders, to the marina or picnic, in A-1 condition.
Do use paper napkins ; lots of them.
Except when you prepare do it yourself shish kebob or a lobster roast.
Then you'll want terry cloth towels for mopping up.
Don't think barbecue cooking is just sometimes, or seasonal.
It's year-round, and everywhere.
In the winter, hibachi in the kitchen or grill over the logs of the fireplace.
Even use your portable electric or gas grill in the winter, inside.
Summertime supper, outside, is a natural.
You'll find, once your technique is perfected, that you can cook on a boat with a simple Bernz-*o-*matic.
Do buy all-purpose mugs or cups.
Get copper or earthenware mugs that keep beer chilled or soup hot.
Be sure to get a few more than you need.
You will discover you keep the sauce for basting meat in one, use six for drinks, serve soup or coffee in another half-dozen -- and need one more to mix the salad dressing.
Don't forget the joys of a meal on the road.
If you travel over the vast U.*s.*a. you will, no doubt, discover that feeding is an expensive business.
Decide in the beginning to put your barbecue equipment to work.
You can take it with you.
A picnic bag, a grill, a cooler for soft drinks and beer, and for frozen convenience foods.
Eat in a restaurant or motel mornings and evenings ; or just evenings.
Turn off at any one of the marked picnic areas ( gasoline companies have touring service bureaus that issue booklets on national parks to tell you where you have barbecue facilities ) and -- with soft drinks cooled from morning loading up, hamburger, buns, an array of relishes, and fresh fruit -- your lunch is 75% cheaper than at a restaurant, and 100% more fun.
You need a little stove, a coffee pot and a stew pot ; maybe a skillet, a basket of essentials like salt, pepper, plates, forks, knives and a can opener.
As you pull out of your motel or national park home-for-the-night, visit a market and buy just what you need for the next meal.
For 25-cents load up the cooler with ice and keep cool pop in the car.
Simple meat dishes spice is a fact of life in the U.*s.*a..
You only have to think of franks and sausages to know what I mean.
Go a step further and list all the wonderful barbecue basics -- cervelat, salami, Vienna sausages, mettwurst, bratwurst, bockwurst, knackwurst, bologna, pepperoni, blutwurst -- and you have a long list of easy specialties.
Threaded on a skewer with new boiled potatoes, a bit of green pepper, a fresh white mushroom -- any one of these spiced meats makes a man a cook, and a meal a feast.
Sure, for the most of us, a frankfurter is the favorite.
A story goes that a certain Herr Feuchtwanger of St. Louis, around 1883 served his sausages ( grilled ) and mustard to his fancy customers.
So that his customers should not soil their hands, Feuchtwanger issued white gloves.
Discovery that the gloves frequently left with the customers made the wise peddler of spiced sausage-meat come upon a compromise.
He had a bakery make buns sized to fit his franks.
Years later, franks-in-buns were accepted as the first to go at the New York Polo Grounds.
The nation's number one picnic treat is the skinless frankfurter -- toasted over a bonfire on the beach or, more sedately, charcoal broiled on a portable grill.
Either way it's hard to beat in flavor as well as ease of preparation.
To make the picnic frank come close to perfection, remember these tips : -- score each frankfurter in four or five places about a third of the way through.
This permits the juices to permeate the meat during cooking.
-- relishes are as vital to the success of the frank as are buns.
Bring along the conventional ones -- catsup, pickle relish, mustard, mayonnaise -- plus a few extras, such as tangy barbecue sauce, chive cream cheese, or horse-radish for the brave ones in the crowd.
-- using a portable grill permits you to toast the buns, too.
Watch closely while browning them, as it doesn't take long.
-- an unusual flavor can be achieved by marinating the franks in French dressing or a mixture of honey, lemon juice and brown sugar prior to the picnic.
Broil or toast as usual.
Contrary to popular opinion, a la mode doesn't mean with ice cream -- it just means, in the latest style.
Here are a couple of the latest, highly styled ways to fix skinless franks in your own back yard ] you'll have the neighbor's eyes popping as well as their mouths watering ] jiffy barbecues 1 cup chili sauce 1/3 cup water 1 tablespoon barbecue sauce 2 teaspoons prepared mustard 1/2 pound chipped, spiced ham 6 sandwich buns, heated.

For sweet-sour sauce, cook onion in oil until soft.
Add remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
Simmer about 10 minutes, and keep warm for serving.
To prepare mustard cream, blend mustard with enough water to make a thin paste.
Fold into whipped cream and add a dash of salt and sprinkling of paprika.

Clean wooden molds and presses thoroughly ; they must be free of oil, wax and dust.
Pressing designs : the size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay needed.
Roll clay to thickness indicated in individual instructions.
Whenever possible, use the wooden mold as a pattern for cutting clay.
When mold has more than one design cavity, make individual paper patterns.
Place mold or paper pattern on rolled clay and cut clay by holding knife in vertical position ( cut more pieces than required for project to make allowance for defects ; experiment with defects for decoration techniques of glazes and colors ).
Place the cut clay piece loosely over the carved cavity design side of wooden mold.
To obtain clear impression of mold, press clay gently but firmly into mold cavity, starting at center and working to outer edges.
Trim excess clay away from outer edges.
Check thickness of clay and build up thin areas by moistening surface with a little water and adding small pieces of clay.
Be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without locking in air bubbles.
Allow project to stand for about five minutes ( if wooden press mold is a good antique, do not leave clay in too long as the dampness may cause mold to crack ).
To release clay from mold, place hands in a cupped position around project ; gently lift the edge on far side, then continue to release edge completely around mold.
Slight tapping on the underside of mold will help release the clay, but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold.
Place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat, clay and mold in one action.
This will prevent the clay from twisting or bending, causing warping when fired.
Place project on table and carefully lift the mold off.
Study surface of clay for defects or desired corrections.
If clay is slightly out of shape, square straight sides with guide sticks or rulers pressed against opposite sides, or smooth round pieces with damp fingers.
If the background of design is too smooth, or you wish to create a wood-grained effect, it may be added at this time with a dull tool such as the handle of a fine paintbrush.
Make slight, smooth grooves rather than cuts for the texture ( cuts could cause air pockets under the glaze creating pinholes or craters in the glaze during firing ).
Leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly, covered lightly with a loose piece of plastic or cloth to prevent warping.

While assembled lid is still on design head, gently but firmly press it on plaster board.
If design head has a deep cavity, clay lid will be quite thick at this point ; press eraser of pencil gently 1/4'' deep into deep clay to allow vent for proper drying and firing.
Check fit of lid on jar ; if inner lid is too big, trim to fit, allowing room for thickness of glaze.
Remove lid from head of mold.
Remove jar from mold.

Hotei is 23 feet long with an 8-1/2-foot beam and every inch a family boat.
Menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman has a clear view.
Youngsters can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which has 5-foot 11-inch headroom, bunks for three, galley and marine toilet.
The gals can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit.
All are well distributed, not crowded together near the stern.
And with passenger weight shifted forward, Hotei levels off for speed under power of a Merc 800.
The 80-hp motor drives her at 25 *j with six aboard ] with only two aboard, Hotei does better than 27 *j -- and she gives a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop.
She also banks into a turn like a fine runabout -- not digging in on the outside to throw passengers all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser.
Nor is she a wet boat.
We've been out in five-foot waves and stayed dry.
A lot of thought went into storage space construction.
There's a large compartment in the forward cockpit for charts and other items.
The cabin has several shelves for small items and storage under the bunks for water skiis, life jackets, etc..
The aft cockpit has a *f storage bin over six feet long that doubles as a seat.
On each side of the motor well there's storage for battery, bumpers, line and spare props with six-gallon gas tanks below.
The well itself is designed to take two Merc 800's or 500's if you wish and there's room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it.
Needless to say, you can't build Hotei in a couple of weeks.
Our building time was slightly over 400 hours -- but the total cost for the hull with Fiberglas bottom, sink, head and hardware was under $800.
A comparable manufactured boat would cost close to $3,000.
Consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $3,000 and your building time is well worth it.
A Gator trailer, Model 565, is used to transport the boat to the waterways.
This piece of equipment costs a little over $600 but it will save you that in mooring and hauling fees in a few years.
All framing in Hotei is one-inch mahogany which, in the dressed state you buy it, is about the 13/16-inch thickness specified in the drawings.
Therefore, the lumber is bought in planks and ripped to size for battens, etc., on a table saw.
Besides flathead bronze screws, silicon bronze Stronghold nails ( made by Independent Nail & Packing Co., Bridgewater, Mass. ) are used extensively in assembly and Weldwood resorcinol glue is used in all the joints.
Construction follows a thorough study of the drawings.
Start by laying out the six frames and the transom on a level floor.
Draw each outline in a different-color chalk, one on top of the other.
In this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistakes.
The transom frame is made first with the joints lapped, glued and fastened with one-inch, No. 12 Stronghold nails.
After notching it for the keelson, chines and battens, the half-inch plywood transom is secured to it with glue and the same type nails.
All frames are butted at the joints and 3/8-inch plywood gussets are glued and nailed on each side of each joint, again using the one-inch, No. 12 nails.
The frames are notched only for the keelson and the chines.
If notched for the battens, they would require more work, be weakened and limber holes would have to be bored so that bilge water could flow through.
Nowhere in the boat do the frames come in contact with the plywood planking.
The jig is erected after the frames and transom are complete.
This is an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively worse misalignment in the hull as you advance in construction.
Be sure all members are parallel, vertical and level as required.
After the frames and transom are set up on the jig and temporarily braced, a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany ( only widths will be given since the 13/16-inch thickness is used throughout ) is butted between frames one and two below the line of the keelson.
The frames are glued and screwed to this piece.
The joints are also reinforced on each side with small blocks set in resin-saturated Fiberglas cloth and nailed.
It is over this piece that the laminated stem and keelson are spliced.
The keelson, made of two three-inch widths, is next installed.
The first piece is glued and screwed to the frames and transom and the piece butted between frames one and two.
The second piece is in turn glued and screwed to the first.
Note, however, that it is six inches shorter at the forward end.
One-inch, No. 10 screws are used in both cases.
A stem jig is next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fastened to frame one.
The stem is laminated from four pieces.
Take two three-inch-wide pieces and rip them down the center of the thickness to make the four.
Then spread a generous amount of glue on the four pieces and bend them into place on the jig.
The first two pieces butt against the inner member of the keelson and are glued and screwed to the brace between the first two frames.
The second two pieces lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member.
They're glued and screwed to the inner member of the keelson.
A number of *j clamps hold the pieces together on the jig until the glue sets.
All bottom battens are two inches wide.
The side ones are a half-inch narrower.
The battens are carefully fastened in place after some necessary fairing on all frames.
Glue and 1-1/2-inch, No. 10 screws are used.
Placement is important because the rear seat, bunks and front jump seats rest on or are fastened to many of the side battens.
With the exception of two battens, all run to the stem where they are glued and screwed after careful beveling.
The chines go in the same way except that they are made of two pieces of two-inch wood for strength and easier bending.
Fairing is always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a Skill planer and a simple jig.
I clamped a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the planer with a pair of Sure Grips.
The aluminum, flush against the battens, acted as a fairing stick and enabled me to plane the chines and keelson to the proper bevels easily.
If you don't own a planer and don't want to buy one, it's well worth renting.
The planking is five-ply, 3/8-inch-thick Weldwood Royal Marine plywood.
This can be obtained in 42-inch widths 24 feet long.
The 42-inch width leaves very little waste.
Four pieces are used.
Plank the sides first, using glue and one-inch, No. 12 Stronghold nails at all battens, the stem and the transom.
Another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fastening.
The best procedure is to have a few friends hold the planking in place while you mark it off.
Then trim the excess.
I used a Homemaster Routo-*jig made by Porter Cable for this job.
It's good for cutting all the planking because it cuts with a bit-like blade at high *j and does not chatter the plywood like a saber saw.
When cut, the planking is clamped in place for a final and careful trimming.
Then it is marked on the inside where it comes in contact with the transom, frames, keelson and all the battens.
It may then be pre-drilled for the fastenings.
The next step is to remove it and spread glue where it has been marked at the contact points.
Then it is replaced and fastened.
The bottom planking is applied in the same manner.
After planking, the bottom gets a layer of Fiberglas.
The spray rails are first glued on the outside and fastened from the inside with screws.
Then the chines are rounded off and the bottom is rough-sanded in preparation.
Since the sides are also covered up to the spray rails, they are also rough-sanded in that area.
The cloth is laid on one half of the bottom at a time.
A 50-inch width is used on each side and it laps the keel line by about three inches.
Lay the cloth in place and trim it to size.
Then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin.
When the resin has hardened, mix up another batch with a pigment added if you wish.
I used bright red, mixing the pigment in thoroughly before adding the hardener.
Using a cheap brush, coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth.
When the cloth is smooth, apply another coat of resin, spreading it with a paint roller.
Be sure it is well saturated and then allow it to harden.
When the whole bottom has hardened, use a disk sander to feather the edges of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail.
Then lay a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem.
Before the resin has hardened, screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline.
This protects the bottom in beaching.
Fiberglas materials are available from Glass Plastic Supply Co., 1605 W. Elizabeth Ave., Linden, N. J..
They will also supply literature on application.
The hull is now turned over ( with the help of about seven friends ) and placed in a level, well-braced position.
I set it on the Gator trailer.
I laid three layers of glass cloth on the inside of the stem, also installing a bow eye at this time.
For added strength, I also fastened a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint.
Again, these blocks were set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nailed.
After trimming off the excess on the frames and transom which was used to fasten them to the jig at a working height, the top of the side planking is installed.
This is made up of scraps left over from the sides and bottom.
These flaring parts really help to keep the boat dry.
When they're on, the top edges are planed even with the sheer batten.
The sides of the motor well run from the bottom battens to the top and from frame six to the transom, forming a real strong transom brace.
Note another piece of wood six inches wide is fastened to the transom between these pieces.
The decking is quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood.
All the flooring and the storage bin is half-inch exterior fir plywood.
Most floor battens are glued and screwed to the flooring.
The exception is where the flooring butts.
These battens are glued and screwed to the frames.
With all deck battens in place, the bilge is cleaned and painted up to the floor line.
Use one coat of Firzite and one coat of marine paint.
Bottoms of the floorboards are also painted and the flooring is then screwed in place.
After the decking is on, the cabin sides are installed.
They're followed by the front and rear bulkheads as illustrated.
The windshield glass is shatterproof and Plexiglas is used in the cabin.
Inside, bunks are framed up and installed as indicated.
A head is a handy thing to have and I installed one under a removable section of the port bunk.
The sink in the hinged panel above the bunk drains into the head and a five-gallon water tank is mounted on the bulkhead above the sink.
For padding the seats and bunks, I used Ensolite, Type *j.
Lightweight, non-absorbent, fire resistant and dimensionally stable, it is easily bonded to the wood with contact cement.
Available in *f sheets, it costs about a dollar a square foot.
You can build this vacation cottage yourself.
It is a full scale, small, but efficient house that can become a year 'round retreat complete in every detail.
Because of the unique design by the architect Egils Hermanovski, you can build most of it in your own home workshop in your spare time.
Most of it is panelized and utilizes standard materials, and requires the use of only simple tools.
On the following pages and in the following issues we take you every step of the way to your vacation cottage, from choosing the proper site to applying the final trim.
In recognition of the growing trend for second homes, or vacation cottages, we have designed this one specifically with the family handyman in mind.
It is a big project, not to be taken lightly.
But each step has been broken down into easy stages, utilizing standard materials and simple tools, well within the capabilities of the handyman.
The theory the idea behind our design is modular units, or panelization.
Everything possible has been scaled to standard sizes and measurements of materials.
Wall panels and structural timbers are standard as are windows and doors, making for a minimum of cutting.
We have developed an ingenious method of interlocking these so that you can make the major part of your house in your own workshop, panel by panel, according to plan.
Thus, when you have prepared your foundation and laid the floor, these can be trucked to the site and erected with a small crew of friends in a weekend.
The roof timbers are precut and the panels standard so that the house can be completely enclosed in a matter of three or four days.
Then you can do the finishing touches at your leisure.
A warning due to the fact that building codes and regulations vary so much throughout the country, the first thing to do is to find out what, if any, they are.
Close to a large city they might even specify the size of the nails used ; in a remote section there might be no restrictions at all.
This can usually be found out at the nearest town hall.
At the same time check the electrical, plumbing, and sanitary requirements, as well as possible zoning regulations.
Whether electricity and public water and sewers are available or not, check the local customs in the use of bottled or *j gas ( we give you alternatives later on ).
Be sure that this information is reasonably official and not just an unfounded opinion.
If there are any major restrictions, they usually can be obtained in printed form.
Where a building permit is required, find out what you must present when applying for one.
In many cases, you must file a complete set of plans with the local building inspector.
These will be available at cost from our Plans Department.
The site some general things to look for in a site, if you haven't already bought one, are accessibility, water drainage, and orientation.
How are the roads, and how will they stand up?
Is there evidence of wash-outs on the property ; swampy areas or intermittent springs?
A visit in the early spring after a thaw will be very informative.
Note where the sun rises and sets, and ask which direction the prevailing winds and storms come from.
Will the view be something you can live with?
Don't worry too much about rocky or sloping terrain ; we will take up alternative foundations later on.
The materials with this first issue we give you a list of the materials needed to build the basic ( *j*a version ) and the expandable ( *j*b version ).
This will be for the shell of the house only ( roof, walls, and floor ), and does not include the carport or balcony.
This will permit you to get a rough estimate of how much the materials for the shell will cost.
Bear in mind that this does not include interior panels for partitions, fancy flooring, appliances and fixtures, electrical wiring, and plumbing, all of which will be taken up in detail in later issues.
The wall panels are constructed of a framework of standard *f and *f of a good grade, free from structural faults.
They should be as straight as possible, as this will effect their ability to mesh properly when the walls are erected.
The outside surface of the solid units shall be of an exterior grade of panel board such as plywood, plastic coated panel board, high density particle board, asbestos-cement board, or any other product locally obtainable upon recommendation of your building supply dealer.
The inner panels do not have to be weatherproof, and the choice will depend on the quality of finish desired.
All panel board comes in standard *f foot size.
It is recommended that panels be both glued as well as nailed to the frame.
The fixed window panels with louvers should have a good grade of 1/8-inch double-strength glass set in a mastic glazing compound.
The louvers are constructed as shown in the detail, with a drop door for ventilation.
There are standard sliding glass windows in wood or aluminum frames for those panels requiring them.
The door panels are designed to accommodate standard doors which should be of exterior grade.
The filler panels for the gable ends are cut from full *f sheets as shown, leaving no wastage.
The battens covering the joints are of *f stock and are applied after the walls are erected.
All nails should be rustproof, and aluminum is highly recommended.
Note : if 1/2-inch panel board is used inside and out, or 5/8-inch one side and 3/8-inch the other, and 1/8-inch glass is used, stock lumber in *f, *f, and *f can be used in making the glass panels.
Other thicknesses may necessitate ripping a special size lumber for the glass trim.
In any case, there is no special milling or rabbeting required for the panels.
With modern techniques of woodworking and the multitude of cutting tools, fixtures, and attachments available, the drill press has become a basic home workshop tool.
The drill press consists of a vertical shaft ( spindle ) which is tapered or threaded on one end to hold a drill chuck, a tubular housing ( quill ) in which the spindle is mounted, a head in which the quill is mounted, a feed lever which moves the quill up or down, a power source, and a movable table upon which the work is placed.
There is often a means of locking the quill and, on larger presses, the table can be tilted.
The size of the press is usually expressed in terms of chuck capacity ( the maximum diameter tool shank it will hold ) or distance between the spindle center and the column.
A press with an 11 inch capacity lets you drill to the center of a 22 inch board or circle.
A new radial drill press with a 16 inch capacity has a tilting head that allows drilling to be done at any angle.
The head is mounted on a horizontal arm that swivels on the supporting column to position the drill bit instead of the work.
Set-up and maintenance the drill press should be leveled and, depending on whether it is a bench or floor model, bolted securely to a sturdy bench or stand or screwed to the floor with lag or expansion screws.
This will reduce vibration and increase accuracy.
A coat of paste wax or a rubdown with a piece of wax paper will protect the polished surface of the table ; wiping with a slightly oiled cloth will discourage rusting of the column and quill.
Presses not fitted with sealed spindle bearings will need a drop of oil now and then in the lubrication holes in the quill.
The rest of the press should be kept clean by dusting with a clean rag or brush.
Be careful to keep the drive belt free of oil and grease.
Belt tension is adjusted by manipulation of two locking bolts and a movable motor mount.
Keep the belt just tight enough so the pulleys won't slip when pulled by hand ; excess tension will only cause undue wear on the motor and spindle bearings.
Most drill presses have a quill return spring that raises the spindle automatically when the feed lever is released and holds the quill in the raised position.
The return spring tension may be adjusted to suit individual requirements by gripping the spring housing with a pair of pliers ( to prevent the spring from unwinding when it is released ), loosening the lock nut or screw, and rotating the housing until the desired tension is achieved.
Turning the housing clockwise will reduce tension, counter-clockwise will increase it.
Don't lose the chuck key.
Some manufacturers have had the foresight to provide a socket for the chuck key ; otherwise, you'll have to spend a few minutes to either attach a suitable spring clip somewhere on the press head or fit the key to a length of light chain and fasten to the bottom of the motor mount so that the key is out of the way when not in use.
Feeds and speeds drill speeds are important if you want a good job.
Each cutting tool will operate best at a given speed, depending on the material worked.
On most drill presses, it is impossible to get the exact speed, but you can come close by adjusting the drive belt on the step-cone pulleys.
You will find a chart giving the various speed ratios available with your particular drill press somewhere in the instruction booklet that came with the tool.
See the table on page 34 for exact recommended speeds.
Generally, the larger the tool and the harder the material, the slower the speed.
Feed pressure is also of major importance.
Too much pressure will force the tool beyond its cutting capacity and result in rough cuts and jammed or broken tools.
Too light a feed, particularly with metal or other hard material, causes overheating of the tool and burning of the cutting edge.
The best results will be obtained by matching the correct speed with a steady feed pressure that lets the tool cut easily at an even rate.
Common drilling tools there are numerous types and styles of tools to drill holes.
The most common are the twist drill, the solid center shaft with interchangeable cutting blades, the double spur bit, and the power wood bit.
All will do a good job if sharp, but the twist drills don't cut quite as smoothly as the others, since they do not have the outlining spurs that sever the fibers before actual boring starts.
The adjustable fly cutter is very useful for cutting large diameter holes and can be used to cut exact-size discs by reversing the cutter blade.
Since fly cutters are one sided and not balanced, they should be used at the slowest speed available, and fed very slowly to avoid binding.
Fly cutters can fool you into putting your hand too close to the tool, so if you want to avoid nicked fingers, keep your hands well out of the way.
Simple hole drilling operations when drilling all the way through a workpiece, always place a piece of scrap wood underneath.
This will not only protect the work table, but also assure a clean breakthrough.
Another method of assuring a clean hole is to first drill a small pilot hole all the way through, then drill half way with the dimensional bit, turn the piece over, and finish from the other side.
In soft woods with pronounced grain, there is sometimes a tendency for the hole to wander, due to the varying hardness of the wood.
In this case, drilling a small pilot hole or clamping the work will do much to improve accuracy.
When a hole is to be bored to a predetermined depth, mark the depth on the side of the stock, then run the bit down so that it is even with the mark.
The depth gauge rod can now be set, and any number of holes bored to exact and identical depth.
The old-time bridges over the Merrimac River in Massachusetts are of unusual interest in many respects.
For their length, their types of construction, their picturesque settings, and their literary associations, they should be known and remembered.
In this sequence I shall write about them in the order of their erection.
The first bridge known to have been covered wholly or in part, -- and perhaps the most interesting one, connected Newbury ( now Newburyport ) with Salisbury Point.
Its building was first proposed in 1791, when a group of citizens, mostly Newburyport men, petitioned the General Court for an act of incorporation.
This document began : No. 1 Newbury Port, may 30th, 1791 whereas, a Bridge over Merrimack River, from the Land of Hon'ble Jonathan Greenleaf, Esquire, in Newbery, to Deer Island, and from said Island to Salisbury, would be of very extensive utility, by affording a safe Conveyance to Carriages, Teams and Travellers at all seasons of the year, and at all Times of Tide.
We, the Subscribers, do agree, that as soon as a convenient Number of Persons have subscribed to this, or a similar Writing, We will present a petition to the Hon'ble General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, praying for an Act incorporating into a Body politic the subscribers to such Writing with Liberty to build such a Bridge, and a Right to demand a Toll equal to that received at Malden Bridge, and on like Terms, and if such an Act shall be obtained, then we severally agree each with the others, that we will hold in the said Bridge the several shares set against our respective Names, the whole into two hundred shares being divided, and that we will pay such sums of Money at such Times and in such Manners, as by the said proposed Corporation, shall be directed and required.
This paper was signed by forty-five persons, subscribing a total of two hundred shares.
A month later the General Court served notice to the town of Newbury that the bridge was to be built.
The matter was considered and reconsidered, and finally opposed, but in spite of many objections, the Court granted a charter on January 9, 1792.
On November 26 of that year the bridge was completed and opened.
Timothy Palmer, who invented and later patented the arch type of construction for wooden bridges, was the genius who planned and supervised the building of the Essex, or Deer Island bridge although the actual work was carried out under the direction of William Coombs, who received $300 as recompense.
This two-part bridge is best described by Rev. Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College, in his Travels In New-*england And New-*york, published in New Haven in 1821.
He says of it : it consists of two divisions, separated by an island at a small distance from the southern shore.
The division between the island and this shore, consists principally of an arch ; whose chord is one hundred and sixty feet, and whose vortex is forty feet ( it was actually 37 feet ) above the high-water mark.
In appearance and construction it resembles the Pascataqua bridge.
The whole length of Essex bridge is one thousand and thirty feet and its breadth thirty-four.
I have already mentioned that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport was the inventor of the arched bridges in this country.
As Mr. Palmer was educated to house-building only, and had never seen a structure of this nature ; he certainly deserves not a little credit for the invention.
It is hardly necessary to remind students of covered bridges that Timothy Palmer was born in 1751 in nearby Rowley ; that he moved with his parents to West Boxford when he was sixteen years old ; and was there apprenticed to a builder and architect, Moody Spofford.
It was indeed a remarkable feat that a man who had had no experience of bridge building should have applied the principle of the arch, which appears in his famous bridges at Portsmouth, Haverhill, and Philadelphia.
The Essex Merrimack Bridge when first built was not covered.
As far as we know, no American bridge had been thus protected in 1792.
Richard S. Allen is the authority for the statement that the northern section was probably roofed by 1810.
Its original appearance is shown in an engraving published in the Massachusetts Magazine in May 1793, which is reproduced herewith ( Fig. 1 ).
A brief description accompanying the picture says that the bridge contained more than 6000 tons of timber.
Between the abutments on the Newbury shore and the south bank of Deer Island there was one span or arch measuring 160 feet ; between the north shore of Deer Island and the Salisbury side there was an arch of 113 feet and a series of piers with a draw forty feet long.
A dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering took place July 4, 1793, in a tavern erected by the corporation on the island.
It is said that the eccentric Timothy Dexter, who was one of the first share-holders, stood on the table and made a speech worthy of the occasion.
The Essex Journal says that he delivered an oration on the bridge, which for elegance of style, propriety of speech or force of argument, was truly Ciceronian.
The reporter must have written this with tongue in cheek, because Dexter's oration could hardly be understood ; and, although he later explained that he was talking French, it seems rather more likely that he had succumbed to the joys of the evening.
The north portion of the Essex bridge was well worth the cost of construction, although it proved to be twice what was estimated in the beginning.
It stood in its original form until 1882.
The southern half, however, on account of its underbracing, was considered by boat owners a menace to navigation.
In 1810 it was torn down and replaced by a chain suspension bridge.
This was built by John Templeman from plans submitted by James Finley of Fayette County, Pennsylvania.
Timothy Palmer had general supervision of the work.
An advertisement in the Newburyport Herald, December 21, 1810, shows Palmer in a new light as an expert on chain bridges.
It reads : chain bridges.
Information is hereby given that Mr. Timothy Palmer of Newburyport, Mass. has agreed to take charge of the concerns of the Patentees of the Chain Bridge, in the states of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Connecticut, so far as relates to the sale of Patent rights and the construction of Chain Bridges.
Mr. Palmer will attend to any applications relating to bridges and if desired will view the proposed site, and lay out and superintend the work, or recommend a suitable person to execute it.
John Templeman approved Timothy Palmer.
This chain bridge proved less durable than the wooden arch on the Salisbury end.
It fell, February 6, 1827, carrying with it a horse and wagon, two men and four oxen.
The horse and men were saved, but the oxen drowned.
In spite of this catastrophe, the bridge was rebuilt on the same plan and opened again on July 17, 1827.
This second chain bridge was 570 feet long, had two thirty-foot towers and a draw, and a double roadway.
The Essex bridge was a toll crossing until 1868, when the County Commissioners laid out all the Merrimack bridges as highways.
Sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use, the old covered, wooden bridge that spans the Tygartis Valley River at Philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the Civil War at its home site, May 28th to June 3rd.
Colonel Frederick W. Lander, impersonated, will again make his break-neck ride down the steep declivity of Talbott's ( now College ) Hill and thunder across the bridge to join Colonel Benjamin F. Kelley's ( West ) Virginia Infantry, then swarming through the streets in pursuit of the retreating Confederates.
He was closely followed by the Ohio and Indiana troops -- thus the old bridge has another distinction ; that of being the first such structure secured by force of arms in the war of the '60s.
The bridge has survived the natural hazards of the elements, war, fire, and floods, as well as injuries incident to heavy traffic, for more than a hundred years.
Twice during the Civil War it was saved from destruction by the opposing armies by the pleas and prayers of a local minister.
It still stands as a monument to the engineering skills of the last century and still serves in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on U.*s. Route 250 -- the old Beverly and Fairmont Turnpike.
It is one of the very few, if not the only surviving bridge of its type to serve a main artery of the U.*s. highway system, thus it is far more than a relic of the horse and buggy days.
This covered, wooden bridge is so closely identified with the first action in the early morning of June 3, 1861, and with subsequent troop movements of both armies in the Philippi area that it has become a part and parcel of the war story.
So frequently have pictures of the bridge appeared in books and in national publications that it vies with the old John Brown Fort at Harpers Ferry as the two nationally best known structures in West Virginia.
Completed and opened for traffic in 1852, the bridge was designed and built by Lemuel Chenoweth and his brother, Eli, of Beverly.
The Chenoweth brothers were experienced bridge builders, and against the competition of other, and better known, bridge designers and builders they had constructed nine of the covered, wooden bridges on the Parkersburg and Staunton Turnpike a dozen years before, as well as many other bridges for several counties.
The Philippi bridge, however, was the Chenoweth master piece, with its 139-foot, dual lane, span -- and it stands today as a monument to its builders.
Never rebuilt, the bridge was strengtened in 1938 by two extra piers, a concrete floor, and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic.
During the war it was in constant use by the wagon trains transporting supplies from the railhead at Grafton to the troops operating in the interior.
Union soldiers at times used it for sleeping quarters to escape from the rain or other inclement weather, and some of them left momentoes of their stay by carving their names and small tokens on its walls and beams.
But what the elements could not do was seriously threatened when Brigadier General William E. ( Grumble ) Jones reached Philippi while on the famous Jones-*imboden raid in May, 1863.
General Jones was fresh from a long series of bridge burnings, including the long bridge at Fairmont, and, after seeing a great drove of horses and cattle he had collected safely across the bridge, he sent his men to work piling combustibles in and around it.
Reverend Joshual Corder, a Baptist minister, gathered a few citizens of Southern sympathies, to call on Jones and plead with him to spare the structure ; he reasoned and argued, pointing out that Jones or other Confederate commanders would need it should troops pass that way in retreat.
Jones relented, he did not order his men to apply the torch -- the drove of livestock was driven up the valley, via Beverly, and across the mountains to feed and serve the Confederate army, while Jones and his raiders turned toward Buckhannon to join forces with Imboden.
Again Reverend Corder saved the bridge when Union soldiers planned to destroy it, after filling its two lanes with hay and straw -- but for what reason is not recorded nor remembered, certainly not because of pressure from an opposing Confederate force.
On the second occasion it took prayers as well as reason to dissuade the soldiers from their purpose.
Centering around this historic old structure, a group of public-spirited Barbour County citizens have organized and planned a week-long series of events, beginning on May 28th and continuing through June 3rd, to observe most appropriately the centennial of the first land engagement of the Civil War at Philippi.
It is a good eight years now since each of us acquired a swimming pool -- eight enlightening, vigorous, rigorous, not wholly unrewarding years.
We have learned a lot -- a dash of hydrochemistry here, a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there.
We have had sound grounding in the principles of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy.
We have become amateur insurance experts and fine-feathered yard birds.
True, our problems have lessened a bit as more and more of our neighbors have built their own pools, thereby diluting our spectacular attractions.
But problems cling to pools, as any pool owner knows.
So our innate generosity of spirit prompts us to share our trials, errors and solutions with any who are taking the pool plunge for the first time -- in the pious hope that some may profit from our experience.
Where to put it position may not be everything, but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulties, social and/or physical.
We speak from varying viewpoints.
One of us has a pool set in a wooded area very near the house.
The other has his pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill.
If you are dreaming of a blue, shimmering pool right outside your living room windows, close your eyes firmly and fill in the picture with lots and lots of children, damp towels, squashed tubes of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toys.
You are likely to be nearer the truth.
You can also see that the greater the proximity of the pool to your main living quarters, the greater the chance for violation of family privacy, annoying noise and the let's-make-your-house-our-clubjj attitude.
On the other hand, out-of-sight does not lead to out-of-mind when children cannot be easily observed and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool.
Another dilemma : as picturesque as a sylvan pond in the forest may be, trees offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool.
Yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a floating lawn every time the grass is mowed.
As in choosing a wife, it is only sensible to consider also how appealing a pool is likely to be in bad weather as well as in good.
In the colder climes, for instance, you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter months when your pool will hardly look its best.
It may be a big hole in the ground filled with salt hay, or an ice floe studded with logs.
Even a neat, plastic-covered plunge is not exactly a joy to behold.
( we do, however, recommend those patented covers to prevent both people and junk -- flora and fauna generally -- from accidentally wintering in the pool.
) probably no location for a pool is perfect on all counts.
Naturally it will be dictated to a large extent by the shape and size of your land.
But if space and money are no problem and small children are not on hand every day, it is certainly more restful to have your pool and entertainment area removed from the immediate environs of the house.
And a good several feet around the pool should be neither greensward nor woods, but good hard pavement.
The placement of your pool, however, will not of itself solve the two major problems of pool owning -- those that involve your social life and those pertaining to safety.
Coping with them demands stern discipline -- of yourself as well as of your family, neighbors, friends and anyone you ever talked to on a transoceanic jet.
Eight years ago while we were going through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period, we were each solaced by the vision of early morning dips and evening home-comings to a cool family collected around the pool with a buffet table laid out nearby for the lord and master's delectation.
But not even our first pool-side gatherings came anywhere near those rosy fantasies.
We seemed to be witnessing the population explosion right in our own backyards.
Our respective families looked as if they had quadrupled.
Had we taken a lien on a state park?
Not at all.
We had merely been discovered by the pool sharks.
We were in business ] from proud pool-owners to perpetual hosts and handymen was a short step -- no more than the change from city clothes to trunks.
Naive of us, maybe, but the results of our impulsive invitations to come over next summer and swim in our new pool were both unexpected and unsettling.
Our book of etiquette after the first few weeks, it was obvious that rules had to be made, laid down and obeyed -- even if our popularity ratings became subnormal as a result.
So rules we made, in unabashed collusion.
Since our viewpoints in this respect coincided precisely, we present the fruits of our efforts herewith as a single social code for pool owners.
First and foremost : no one -- no, not anyone -- in the family is allowed to issue blanket invitations to his or her own circle.
Just short of forty lashes we finally managed to coerce our children to this view.
Their friends and ours are welcome to share the pool, but on our terms and at our times.
No friends are to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephoning beforehand.
No ringers, either -- even if they are trailing legitimate invitees.
We want to know when the Potlatches telephone exactly how many they are planning to bring, so that we won't end up with a splashing mob that looks like Coney Island in August.
No young children may come without adults except for a specific, organized, chaperoned party.
And accompanying adults are urged to keep an alert and sensible eye on their responsibilities.
A gaggle of gabbling mothers, backs to the pool, is no safeguard.
No bottle pool is tolerated -- bottle pool being our lingo for those who come to swim and sink into our bar while protesting that they can only dunk and run.
( sanity, solvency and relations with our wine merchant took a beating that first summer as we inadvertently became the neighborhood free-drink stop.
) we designated one day a week as the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hours.
This has saved us from constant requests seven days a week and made us feel less brutal to the young less fortunate than ours.
We also worked out logistics for Sunday afternoon swimmers who arrive two hours early with their weekend guests while we are still enjoying an alfresco lunch en famille.
We gently usher them to an island of tables and chairs strategically placed on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge sides.
All dressing ( undressing to be more exact ) must be done in our small bath house or at the swimmers' homes.
( to avoid any possible excuse for a dripping parade through your house, it is a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool as well as a direct outdoor route between the pool, and the parking area.
) we do, however, provide a limited number of extra suits, mainly for children, and we stock extra towels and a few inexpensive bathing conveniences.
Life-preservers, the buckle-on kapok-filled kind, are held in readiness, too, for the very young.
Preserving life and limb safety rules, of course, are more important than all the others put together.
In many localities, now, the law requires all pools to be fenced, usually to a minimum height of 5 feet.
But fenced or unfenced, no pool-side is the place for running or horseplay.
We allow no underwater endurance contests, either, or inexpert versions of water polo.
Diving boards must have non-skid surfaces ( coco matting takes an awful beating from chlorine and rots quickly, but grit-impregnated paints are excellent ).
And divers must be enjoined to look before they leap, either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge.
Our pools also have wide, shallow steps -- for the benefit of the littlest swimmers who can thus be introduced to the water with far greater safety than a ladder affords.
All bottles must be kept a safe distance away from the pool and drinking glasses are banned in favor of plastic or metal cups.
When you first acquire a pool, we earnestly recommend -- for your own mental health -- a good long chat with your insurance agent.
You should be prepared to cope with any pitfall such as plunges into empty pools or shallow ends and all manner of winter as well as summer lawsuits.
Soignee pools, alas, do not just happen.
They are the result of a constant and careful contest with the elements.
Unless you want to make your wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of your leisure hours nursing your pool's pristine purity, its care and feeding -- from *j content to filtering and vacuuming -- is best left to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service.
Of course, if your pool is close to the house, your wife can always add it to her housekeeping chores ( you hope ).
Or you can make pool care the price of swimming for teen-agers.
Even so, every pool owner, in case of emergency, should have some idea of what makes things work.
A brief course in hydraulics from the pool builders may well be appreciated in a future crisis.
Preserving the pool a sudden high rise in temperature will turn your pool poison green overnight.
You need more chlorine.
The walls feel slippery.
You need algaecide.
With or without professional help, you will have to be able to do some of these jobs yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse.
You should see to it that the trap, the dirt-catcher in front of the filter, is always clean.
A pool is no place for a shut trap.
You should firmly insist that no bobby pins or hair pins be worn in the water.
When shed, they leave rust marks.
You can hope against hope that come spring cleaning, your fair-weather friends will lend a hand at scrubbing and furbishing.
It has happened.
Many hours of spring cleaning will be saved, however, if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall.
As the pool is emptied, stand by to brush down the walls and bottom while they are still wet.
Much of the dirt and leaf stain is easily removed when damp, but requires dynamite if allowed to dry.
If you have a 6- to 8-inch drain pipe, you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate is out.
Of course, when your 6-inch torrent of water is released, it may cause a lot of comment as it passes through or by neighboring properties.
Do not forget this possibility.
If your pool is located on or near sloping ground, it may have natural drainage which is certainly more desirable than to be faced with the annual expense and labor of first pumping out the water and then scooping out all the debris.
It may be true that pool lighting dramatizes an evening scene, but lights also attract all the insect life for miles around.
Once on the water, these little visitors seldom leave, and this adds to your filtering and vacuuming problems as well as providing a slapping good time for all those present.
Often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense.
Our experience has taught us that it pays to buy the best equipment possible, from pipes to brushes.
Follow pool-care instructions to the letter, and be sure that one person ( in the family or not ) is regularly responsible for each aspect of the job, with no chance for claiming, it wasn't my turn.
Never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valves -- even if the little boys do want to play space ship.
You may find yourself hitting bottom, literally, as you discover that water is running out even while you are putting it in.
Draw a line across the country at the latitude of lower Pennsylvania.
Any house built now below that line without air conditioning will be obsolete in 10 years.
Fortunately, it is the *j which has arrived at this conclusion, for it means that cooling equipment of all kinds may now be included in a mortgage, and thus acquired with a minimum of financial stress.
Even if you live above that line, the *j will back you, for they have decided that the inclusion of air conditioning in all new homes is a good thing and should be encouraged.
New simplified packaged units, recently devised prefabricated glass-fiber ducts, and improved add-on techniques make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for as little as $600 to $900.
Two men can often do the installation in a day.
You can install it yourself -- this is a central system that will cool every part of your house.
Its upkeep?
No less an authority than the *j concurs that the savings air conditioning makes possible more than offset its operating costs.
Is it worth-while?
Home air conditioning has come a long way from the early days of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflicted.
We know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature is the maximum usually desirable, and accurate controls assure the comfort we want.
We know, too, that health is never harmed by summer cooling.
On the contrary, there are fewer colds and smaller doctor bills.
The filtered air benefits allergies, asthma, sinus, hay fever.
Control of temperature and humidity is a godsend to the aged and the invalid.
Heart conditions and high blood pressure escape the stresses brought on by oppressive heat.
Housekeeping is easier.
The cleaner air means less time spent pushing a vacuum, fewer trips to the dry cleaners, lighter loads for the washing machine.
The need for reupholstering, redecorating, repainting becomes more infrequent.
Clothes hold their shape better, and mildew and rust become almost forgotten words.
It will improve your disposition.
When you're less fatigued, things just naturally look brighter.
The children can have their daytime naps and hot meals, and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened rooms.
You'll sleep longer and better, too, awake refreshed and free of hot weather nerves.
You can forget about screens, and leave the storm windows up all year around.
Best of all, central air conditioning is something you can afford.
Like its long-lived cousin, the refrigerator, a conditioner can be expected to last 20 to 25 years or more.
That brings its per-year cost down mighty low.
For any house.
No matter what style your home is, ranch, two-story, Colonial or contemporary, central air conditioning is easily installed.
The equipment won't take up valuable space either.
It can go in out-of-the-way waste space.
But there's no denying that the easiest and most economical way to get year-'round whole-house air conditioning is when you build.
If that's done, the house can be designed and oriented for best operation, and this can mean savings both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself.
If you can't see your way clear to have summer cooling included when building, by all means make provision for its easy adding later.
Manufacturers have designed equipment for just such circumstances, and your savings over starting from scratch will be substantial.
If your house is to have a forced warm air system, cooling can be a part of it.
This costs less than having a completely separate cooling system, for your regular heating ductwork, filters and furnace blower do double duty for cooling.
You can get year-'round air conditioners in the same variety of styles in which you buy a furnace alone -- high or low boy, horizontal or counterflow.
The units can be installed in basement, attic, crawlspace, or in a closet located in the living area.
The cooling coil is located in the furnace's outlet.
From the coil small copper pipes connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard, garage, carport, or basement.
If you plan to add cooling later to your heating system, there are things to watch for.
Be sure ducts that require insulation get it when they are installed.
They may be inaccessible later.
Be sure your ducts and blower are big enough to handle cooling.
This is especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone.
Be sure you get a perimeter heating system, and diffusers that will work as well for cooling as they do for heating.
You can get a hot water system that will also work for cooling your house.
For cooling, chilled water is circulated instead of hot water.
Instead of radiators you'll have cooling-heating units, each with its own thermostat.
These systems are more expensive than year-'round forced air systems.
The minimum cost for an average one-story, 7-room house with basement, is likely to run $1500 above the cost of the heating alone.
Separate systems.
If the problems of combining cooling with your heating are knotty, it may be cheaper to plan on a completely separate cooling system.
The simplest kind of separate system uses a single, self-contained unit.
It is, in effect, an oversize room conditioner equipped with prefab glass-fiber ducts to distribute the cooled, cleaned, dehumidified air where it is wanted.
In a long, rambling ranch, two such units can be installed, one serving the living area, the other the sleeping zone.
In a two-story house, one unit may be installed in the basement to serve the first floor, another in the attic to cool the second.
In each case, having separate systems for living and sleeping areas has the advantage of permitting individual zone control.
The heat pump.
One of the more remarkable of the new cooling systems is one that can be switched to heating.
As you know, a conditioner makes indoor air cool by pumping the heat out of it and then releasing this heat outdoors.
A relatively simple switching arrangement reverses the cycle so that the machine literally runs backward, and the heat is extracted from outdoor air and turned indoors.
Up until recently, this heat pump method of warming air was efficient only in areas of mild winters and when outside temperatures were above 40 degrees.
Now, the machine has been improved to a point where it is generally more economical than oil heat at temperatures down to 15 degrees.
You can get this added heating feature for as little as $200 more than the price of cooling alone.
Consider it as a standby setup, at negligible cost, for those emergencies when the furnace quits, a blizzard holds up fuel delivery, or for cool summer mornings or evenings when you don't want to start up your whole heating plant.
What size conditioner?
How large a cooling unit you need, and the method of its installation, depends on a variety of factors.
Among other things, besides the nature of your house and how much heat finds its way into its various rooms from the outside, it will depend upon your personal habits and the makeup of your family.
Families with children usually don't want the house quite so cool.
If you are a party thrower, you may need added capacity.
The body is a heat machine, and 20 to 25 guests can easily double your cooling load.
Cooling requirements are best expressed in terms of *j.
A *j is a unit of heat, and the *j rating of a conditioner refers to how much heat your machine can pump out of your house in an hour.
A very rough rule of thumb is that, under favorable conditions, you'll need 15 *j of cooling for every square foot of your house.
This is if outdoor temperatures have a high average of 95 degrees.
You'll need more if the high average is above that, less if it's below.
Coolers are also rated by tons.
A ton of cooling compares to the cooling you get by melting a ton of ice.
By accepted definition, a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12,000 *j of cooling in one hour.
You may find a conditioner rated by horsepower.
It is generally an inaccurate method of rating, for the horsepower is that of the compressor motor, and many other components beside it determine how much cooling you'll get.
A 1-hp conditioner, for example, may vary in effectiveness from under 8,000 *j to well over 10,000 *j.
The safest procedure is to let your builder estimate the size of the unit you need, rather than trying to do this yourself.
Don't urge your builder to give you a little extra cooling capacity just to be sure you have enough.
Better to have your equipment slightly undersized than too big.
Here's why : reducing humidity is often as important as cooling.
An oversize unit will cool off your house quickly, then shut down for a long period.
Before it cycles on again, humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature is still low.
With a unit of the right size, a compressor will run continuously during hot weather, reducing humidity as evenly as it does temperature.
Money-saving tips.
Attention to details can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operating expense proportionately.
A well-designed, 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cooled and heated for as little as $128 a year, or $11 a month.
If you have a house which heat doesn't penetrate easily, your unit will have less heat to remove.
Keep the direct sun from reaching the house and you've won the first battle.
In a new house, generous roof overhangs are a logical and effective solution.
If the house you plan to buy or build won't have big overhangs, you can still do a fair job of keeping the sun off walls and windows with properly designed trellises, fences and awnings.
Shade trees, too, are a big help, so keep them if you can.
Drawn blinds and draperies do some good, but not nearly as much as shading devices on the outside of the house.
The more directly the sun strikes walls and roof, the greater its heat impact.
The way a house is set on its lot can therefore influence how much cooling you're going to need.
A shift in the walls, or a change in the roof slope, so the sun hits them more obliquely, can save you money.
You can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun, double glass and insulated glass to combat condensation.
Restrict large glass areas to the north and south sides of the house.
They're easier to shade there.
An attic space above insulation makes a house easier to cool.
You'll even gain by putting your water heater outside the conditioned space, and using an electric range instead of a gas one.
Gas adds to the moisture load.
Insulate, weatherstrip, double-glaze to the maximum.
In insulation, the numbers to remember are 6-4-2.
They stand for 6 inches of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling, 4 inches in the side walls, 2 inches in the floors.
Such extra-thick insulation not only permits a much smaller cooling installation, but will continue to reduce operating expenses both in heating and cooling.
A light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent.
It costs two to three times as much to remove a *j in summer as it does to add one in winter, so every solitary *j is worth attention.
You'll foil them in droves, along with their pal humidity, by having and using a kitchen range exhaust fan, a bathroom ventilator for when you shower, and an outside vent for the clothes drier.
Keeping conditioners quiet.
It's no use pretending that all conditioners are quiet, but the noise they produce can be kept to a minimum.
Good workmanship is important in the installation, so if you're doing your own contracting, don't award the job on the basis of price alone.
Avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom.
Most recreation work calls for a good deal of pre-planning.
This is particularly true in site selection.
You must know before you start what the needs and objectives of your organization are ; you must have a list of requirements on where, how many, and what type sites are needed.
With such a program you can make constructive selections of the best sites available.
Begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photos if possible.
These are becoming more and more available through the work of counties and other government agencies.
The new editions of topographic maps being made by the federal government are excellent for orienting yourself to the natural features of the site.
These are inexpensive and available from the U. S. Geological Society, Washington 25, D. C..
In recent years many counties and the U. S. Forest Service have taken aerial photos which show features in detail and are very good for planning use.
Most counties also have maps available from the county engineer showing roads and other features and from the assessor's office showing ownerships of land.
Inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily used for recreation.
This gives you a better opportunity to get the feel of the climate conditions, the exposure to the sun and wind, the water interests, etcetera, which vary greatly with the seasons.
It is usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field, showing the size and location of the features of interest and to take photographs at the site.
These are a great aid for planning use back at the office.
For site planning work, it is best to have a qualified and experienced park planner to carry through the study.
However, there is also much to be gained by making use of the abilities of the local people who are available and interested in recreation.
County judges, commissioners, engineers, assessors, and others who have lived in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regarding the site or opinions to offer from their varied professional experiences.
A visit to the site by a group of several persons can usually bring out new ideas or verify opinions most helpful to the planning study of any recreation area.
How much study is required?
This, of course, depends on the character of the site itself, the previous experience of the investigator, and the number of factors needed to arrive at a good decision.
It is too easy for the inexperienced person to make a quick judgment of a few values of the area and base a decision on these alone.
Usually there are more factors to good site planning than first impressions.
A site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potentials for the future with a little development or water.
The same is true of areas which at first look good because of a few existing recreation features but may actually be poor areas to develop for general public use.
In looking for the best sites available that meet the requirements, you need information to compare the site with others.
You need answers to four important questions.
What are the existing recreation features?
How well can the site be developed?
How useful will it be to the public?
Is this site available?
Check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interests already existing at the site.
Naturally, a park site with scenic views, a good lake, trees, and sand dunes, will attract more people than a nearby area with only trees and dunes.
Quality is vitally important.
Frontage on a body of clear, clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on polluted water.
Some recreation features, such as scenic values and water interest, also have greater overall value than other interests.
One of the most desirable features for a park are beautiful views or scenery.
It may be distant views of a valley or the mountains or natural features such as a small lake, colorful rock formations, or unusual trees.
A site which overlooks a harbor or river may offer interest in the activities of boating traffic.
An area on the coast may have relaxing views of the surf rolling in on a beach.
A site may also be attractive just through the beauty of its trees and shrubs.
Note extent of these interests and how available they will be for the public to enjoy.
Water interest is one of the most valuable factors you can find for a recreation site.
Most park planners look to water frontage for basic park areas.
This follows naturally since frontage on an ocean, stream, or lake provides scenic values and opportunities for the very popular recreation activities of bathing, fishing, boating, and other water sports.
A body of water is usually the center of interest at parks which attract the greatest picnic and camping use.
It also cools the air in summer and nourishes the trees and wild life.
The amount of water frontage, the quantity and quality of the water, and the recreation afforded by it are important.
A restricted frontage may be too crowded an area for public use.
The quantity of water flow may be critical ; a stream or pond which is attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer.
If the site is on a reservoir, the level of the water at various seasons as it affects recreation should be studied.
Check the quality of the water.
A stream which has all of its watershed within a national forest or other lands under good conservation practices is less likely to be affected by pollution than one passing through unrestricted logging or past an industrial area.
Other factors, such as water temperature, depth of water, the fish life it supports, wave action, flooding, etcetera, will affect its recreation value.
Other natural features which can be of high interest are the forests, canyons, mountains, deserts, seacoast, beaches, sand dunes, waterfalls, springs, etcetera with which the area is blessed.
Just as the national and state parks place emphasis on features which are of national or state significance, counties should seek out these features which are distinctive of their area.
Although the site may not contain the features themselves, there are often opportunities to include them as additional interest to the site.
The route to the park may lead people past them or display views of them.
A group of native trees or plants which are outstanding in a particular county can be featured at the site.
The fish, animals, and birds which may be found at the site are another interest.
Fishing interest calls for a check of the species found, quantity and size, the season they are available, and the stocking program of the fish commission.
Animals may be present at the site or provide hunting in nearby areas.
The site may be on one of the major flyways of migratory birds or have its own resident bird life.
Clams, crabs, and other marine life may add interest at coastal areas.
Each area has its own historical interests with which much can be done.
Park visitors are always eager to learn more about the area they are in.
The historical sign tells its story, but nothing gets interest across as well as some of the original historical items or places themselves which still have the character of the period covered.
Notice should be taken of unusual rock formations, deposits, or shapes of the earth's crust in your region.
Those which tell a story of the earth's formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation sites.
An old shipwreck, a high dam, an old covered bridge, a place to find agates or other semi-precious stones or a place to pan gold, etcetera may be of interest.
Some areas may provide archeological values such as ancient Indian village sites or hunting areas, caves, artifacts, etcetera.
How well can the site be developed?
Look at the physical features of the land to determine how desirable it is for use, what can be done to correct the faults, and what it will cost to make the area meet your needs in comparison to other sites.
Many things need to be checked : size and shape -- the size of the area alone can be a determining factor.
An area may be too small for the needs of the project.
Areas should be large enough to include the attractions, have ample space for the use of facilities needed, and have room around the edges to protect the values of the area from encroachment by private developments.
Acreage in excess of the minimum is good practice as recreation areas are never too large for the future and it is often more economical to operate one large area than several small ones.
Shape of the area is also related to the use attractions and needs of the development.
A large picnic area or camping development is most efficient in shape as a square or rectangle several hundred feet in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred feet wide.
This is true because of savings in utility lines and the fact that your buildings have a useful radius equal in all directions.
However, a narrow strip may be very practical for small developments, or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman's trail, or include scenic strips within the park unit.
Adjoining areas -- the values of the site may be affected by the appearance of the adjoining lands, ownership and use of the land, and the utilities available there.
For instance, a site adjoining other publicly owned lands, such as a national forest or a public road, may be desirable, whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not.
The utilities available nearby may provide a savings in the cost of extending electricity or water to the site.
Topography -- topography is very important.
Check the elevation of the ground, degree and direction of slopes, drainage, rock outcrops, topsoil types and quality, as well as subsoil.
Nearly level areas are required for parking areas, beaches, camp areas, ballfields, etcetera.
Determine how much topography limits useful area or what the costs of earth moving or grading might be.
Water -- in addition to its recreation interests, water is needed for drinking, sanitation, and irrigation.
The quantity and quality of water sources is often a big factor in site selection.
The area may provide good springs or opportunities for a well or be near to municipal water lines.
Figure the cost of providing water to the use areas.
Plants -- the existing plant growth calls for thorough checking.
Look at the trees as to size and interest, the amount of shade they provide, how healthy they are, the problems of maintenance, fire hazards, wind throw, etcetera.
An area may have been partially logged and requires removal of stumps or clean-up.
Some shrubs may be of good landscaping value, other areas of brush may need to be cleared.
The extent and location of open areas is noted.
Exposure -- how much will wind, rain, sun, and temperature affect the use?
An area sheltered from strong winds may be highly desirable for recreation use.
The direction, velocity, and season of these winds should be noted as to just how they will affect the recreation use and your maintenance and operation of the area.
Lack of rainfall and extreme temperatures may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable.
Sometimes, you have a choice of exposure for sites where the topography or trees of the area will provide afternoon shade, morning sun, or whatever may be most desirable for the use intended.
Improvements -- some areas may already have been improved and contain buildings, roads, utilities, cleared land, etcetera which may raise the cost of the site.
Your invitation to write about Serge Prokofieff to honor his 70th anniversary for the April issue of Sovietskaya Muzyka accepted with pleasure, because I admire the music of Prokofieff ; and with sober purpose, because the development of Prokofieff personifies, in many ways, the course of music in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.
The Serge Prokofieff whom we knew in the United States of America was gay, witty, mercurial, full of pranks and bonheur and very capable as a professional musician.
These qualities endeared him to both the musicians and the social-economic haute monde which supported the concert world of the post-*world War 1 era.
Prokofieff's outlook as a composer-pianist-conductor in America was, indeed, brilliant.
Prokofieff's Classical Symphony was hailed as an ingenious work from a naturally gifted and well-trained musician still in his twenties.
To the Traditionalists, it was a brilliant satire on modernism ; to the Neo-*classicists, it was a challenge to the pre-war world.
What was it to Prokofieff?
A tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-*century ideas ; a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the times ; a brilliant piece de resistance?
Certainly its composer was an ascending star on a new world horizon.
I heard the Classical Symphony for the first time when Koussevitzky conducted it in Paris in 1927.
All musical Paris was there.
Some musicians were enthusiastic, some skeptical.
I myself was one of the skeptics ( 35 years ago ).
I remember Ernest Bloch in the foyer, shouting in his high-pitched voice : it may be a tour de force, mais mon Dieu, can anyone take this music seriously?
The answer is, yes ] certainly, America took Prokofieff and his Classical Symphony seriously, and with a good deal of pleasure.
His life-long friend, Serge Koussevitzky, gave unreservedly of his praise and brilliant performances in Boston, New York, and Washington, D.*c., to which he added broadcastings and recordings for the whole nation.
Chicago was also a welcome host : there, in 1921, Prokofieff conducted the world premiere of the Love For Three Oranges, and played the first performance of his Third Piano Concerto.
Uncle Sam was, indeed, a rich uncle to Prokofieff, in those opulent, post-war victory years of peace and prosperity, bold speculations and extravaganzas, enjoyment and pleasure : The Golden Twenties.
We attended the premieres of his concertos, symphonies, and suites ; we studied, taught, and performed his piano sonatas, chamber music, gavottes, and marches ; we bought his records and played them in our schools and universities.
We unanimously agreed that Prokofieff had won his rights as a world citizen to the first ranks of Twentieth-*century Composers.
Nevertheless, Prokofieff was much influenced by Paris during the Twenties : the Paris which was the artistic center of the Western World -- the social Paris to which Russian aristocracy migrated -- the chic Paris which attracted the tourist dollars of rich America -- the avant-garde Paris of Diaghileff, Stravinsky, Koussevitzky, Cocteau, Picasso -- the laissez-faire Paris of Dadaism and ultramodern art -- the Paris sympathique which took young composers to her bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasms.
So young Prokofieff was the darling of success : in his motherland ; in the spacious hunting grounds of Uncle Sam ; in the exciting salons of his lovely, brilliant Paris -- mistress of gaiety -- excess and abandon -- world theatre of new-found freedoms in tone, color, dance, design, and thought.
Meanwhile, three great terrible forces were coagulating and crystallizing.
In this world-wide conscription of men, minds, and machines, Prokofieff was recalled to his native land.
The world exploded when Fascism challenged all concepts of peace and liberty, and the outraged, freedom-loving peoples of the Capitalist and Socialist worlds combined forces to stamp Fascist tyranny into cringing submission.
After this holocaust, a changing world occupied the minds of men ; a world beset with new boundaries, new treaties and governments, new goals and methods, and the age-old fears of aggression and subjugation -- hunger and exposure.
In this changed world, Prokofieff settled to find himself, and to create for large national purpose.
Here, this happy, roving son of good fortune proved that he could accept the disciplines of a new social-economic order fighting for its very existence and ideals in a truculent world.
Here, Prokofieff became a workman in the vineyards of Socialism -- producing music for the masses.
It is at this point in his life that the mature Prokofieff emerges.
One might have expected that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroyed the creative flair of a composer, especially one whose works were so fluent and spontaneous.
But no : Prokofieff grew.
He accepted the environment of his destiny -- took root and grew to fulfill the stature of his early promise.
By 1937 he had clarified his intentions to serve his people : I have striven for clarity and melodious idiom, but at the same time I have by no means attempted to restrict myself to the accepted methods of harmony and melody.
This is precisely what makes lucid, straightforward music so difficult to compose -- the clarity must be new, not old.
How right he was ; how clearly he saw the cultural defection of experimentation as an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism.
And with what resource did Prokofieff back up his Credo of words -- with torrents of powerful music.
Compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between his neat and witty little Classical Symphony and his big, muscular, passionate, and eloquent Fifth Symphony ; or the Love For Three Oranges ( gay as it is ) with the wonderful, imaginative, colorful, and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet, the Stone Flower.
This masterpiece has gaiety, too, but it is the gaiety of dancing people : earthy, salty and humorous.
Of course, these works are not comparable, even though the same brain conceived them.
The early works were conceived for a sophisticated, international audience ; the later works were conceived to affirm a way of life for fellow citizens.
However, in all of Prokofieff's music, young or mature, we find his profile -- his signature -- his craftsman's attitude.
Prokofieff never forsakes his medium for the cause of experimentation per se.
In orchestration, he stretches the limits of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color.
His sense for rhythmic variety and timing is impeccable.
His creative development of melodic designs of Slavic dance tunes and love songs is captivating : witty, clever, adroit, and subtle.
His counterpoint is pertinent, skillful, and rarely thick.
Also, it should be noted that the polytonal freedom of his melodies and harmonic modulations, the brilliant orchestrations, the adroitness for evading the heaviness of figured bass, the skill in florid counterpoint were not lost in his mature output, even in the spectacular historical dramas of the stage and cinema, where a large, dramatic canvas of sound was required.
That Prokofieff's harmonies and forms sometimes seem professionally routine to our ears, may or may not indicate that he was less of an original than we prefer to believe.
Need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability.
Prokofieff might well emerge as a cultural hero, who, by the force of his creative life, helped preserve the main stream of tradition, to which the surviving idioms of current experimentalism may be eventually added and integrated.
At this date, it seems probable that the name of Serge Prokofieff will appear in the archives of History, as an effective Traditionalist, who was fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation, and used it as it served his purpose ; yet was never caught up in it -- never a slave to its academic dialectics.
Certainly, it is the traditional clarity of his music which has endeared him to the Western World -- not his experimentations.
So Prokofieff was able to cultivate his musical talents and harvest a rich reward from them.
Nor can anyone be certain that Prokofieff would have done better, or even as well, under different circumstances.
His fellow-countryman, Igor Stravinsky, certainly did not.
Why did Prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity, while Stravinsky ( who leaped into fame like a young giant ) dwindled in stature and fruitfulness?
I think the answer is to be found in Prokofieff's own words : the clarity must be new, not old.
When Prokofieff forged his new clarity of lucid, straightforward music, so difficult to compose, he shaped his talents to his purpose.
When Stravinsky shaped his purpose to the shifting scenes of many cultures, many salons, many dialectics, many personalities, he tried to refashion himself into a stylist of many styles, determined by many disparate cultures.
Prokofieff was guided in a consistent direction by the life of his own people -- by the compass of their national ideas.
But Stravinsky was swayed by the attitudes of whatever culture he was reflecting.
In all his miscalculations, Stravinsky made the fatal historical blunder of presuming that he could transform other composers' inspirations -- representing many peoples, time periods and styles -- into his own music by warping the harmony, melody, or form, to verify his own experiments.
Because of the authentic homogeneity of his early Nationalistic materials, and his flair for orchestrations -- his brilliant Petruchka, his savage Sacre Du Printemps, his incisive Les Noces -- the world kept hoping that he could recapture the historical direction for which his native talents were predisposed.
But time is running out, and many of Stravinsky's admirers begin to fear that he will never find terra firma.
His various aesthetic postulates remain as landmarks of a house divided against itself : Supra-*expressionism, Neo-*paganism, Neo-*classicism, Neo-*romanticism, Neo-*jazz, Neo-*ecclesiasticism, Neo-*popularism, and most recently, Post-*serialism -- all competing with each other within one composer ] what a patchwork of proclamations and renunciations ] meager and shabby by-products linger to haunt our memories of a once mighty protagonist ; a maladroit reharmonization of our National Anthem ( The Star-*spangled Banner ) ; a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto ; a circus polka for elephants ; his hopes that the tunes from his old music might be used for popular American commercial songs ] Stravinsky, nearing the age of eighty, is like a lost and frantic bird, flitting from one abandoned nest to another, searching for a home.
How differently Prokofieff's life unfolded.
Prokofieff was able to adjust his creative personality to a swiftly changing world without losing his particular force and direction.
In the process, his native endowments were stretched, strengthened and disciplined to serve their human purpose.
With a large and circumspect 20th-*century technique, he wove the materials of national heroes and events, national folklore and children's fairy tales -- Slavic dances and love songs -- into a solid musical literature which served his people well, and is providing much enjoyment to the world at large.
Of course, it must not be forgotten that in achieving this historical feat, Prokofieff had the vast resources of his people behind him ; time and economic security ; symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies ; choruses, chamber music ensembles ; soloists ; recordings ; broadcastings ; television ; large and eager audiences.
It must be conceded that his native land provided Prokofieff with many of the necessary conditions for great creative incentive : economic security and cultural opportunities, incisive idioms, social fermentations for a new national ideology -- a sympathetic public and a large body of performers especially trained to fulfill his purpose.
Thus in Prokofieff the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics produced one of the great composers of the Twentieth Century.
That his moods, even in his early years, are those of his people, does him honor, as his music honors those who inspired it.
That he mastered every aspect of his medium according to his own great talents and contemporary judgments, is a good and solid symbol of his people under the tremendous pressures of proclaiming and practising the rigors of a new culture ; and perhaps of even greater significance -- his music is strong 20th-*century evidence of the effectiveness of Evolution, based on a broad Traditionalism for the creative art of music.
April 10 marked a memorable date in New York's musical history -- indeed in the musical history of the entire eastern United States.
On that date the Musicians Emergency Fund, organized to furnish employment for musicians unable to obtain engagements during the depression and to provide relief for older musicians who lost their fortunes in the stock market crash, observed its 30th anniversary.
Roy Mason is essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction has a kinship with the English watercolorists of the early nineteenth century, especially the beautifully patterned art of John Sell Cotman.
And like this English master, Mason realizes his subjects in large, simplified masses which, though they seem effortless, are in reality the result of skilled design born of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspired them.
As a boy Roy Mason began the long process of extracting the goodness of the out-of-doors, its tang of weather, its change of seasons, its variable moods.
His father, a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter, took his sons on numerous hunting expeditions, and imparted to them his knowledge and love of nature.
Out of this background of hunting and fishing, it was only natural that Roy first painted subjects he knew best : hunters in the field, fishermen in the stream, ducks and geese on the wing -- almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape.
It is this subject matter that has brought Mason a large and enthusiastic following among sportsmen, but it is his exceptional performance with this motif that commends him to artists and discerning collectors.
Mason had to earn the privilege of devoting himself exclusively to painting.
Like many others, he had to work hard, long hours in a struggling family business which, though it was allied to art of a kind -- the design and production of engraved seals -- bore no relation to the painting of pictures.
But it did teach Roy the basic techniques of commercial art, and later, for twelve years, he and his sister Nina conducted an advertising art studio in Philadelphia.
On the death of their father, they returned to their home in Batavia, New York.
After more years of concentrated effort, Roy and his brother Max finally established a thriving family business at the old stand.
During all this time Roy continued to paint, first only on weekends, and then, as the family business permitted, for longer periods.
Gradually he withdrew from the shop altogether, and for the past thirty years, he has worked independently as a painter, except for his continued hunting and fishing expeditions.
But even on these, the palette often takes over while the shotgun cools off ] except for a rich friendship with the painter, Chauncey Ryder who gave him the only professional instruction he ever had -- and this was limited to a few lessons, though the two artists often went on painting trips together -- Roy developed his art by himself.
In the best tradition, he first taught himself to see, then to draw with accuracy and assurance, and then to paint.
He worked in oil for years before beginning his work in watercolor, and his first public recognition and early honors, including his election to the Academy, were for his essays in the heavier medium.
Gradually watercolor claimed his greater affection until today it has become his major, if not exclusive, technique.
It has been my privilege to paint with Roy Mason on numerous occasions, mostly in the vicinity of Batavia.
More often than not I have found easy excuse to leave my own work and stand at a respectable distance where I could watch this man transform raw nature into a composed, not imitative, painting.
What I have observed time and time again is a process of integration, integration that begins as abstract design and gradually takes on recognizable form ; color patterns that are made to weave throughout the whole composition ; and that over-all, amazing control of large washes which is the Mason stylemark.
Finally come those little flicks of a rigger brush and the job is done.
Inspiring -- yes ; instructive -- maybe ; duplicable -- no ] but for the technical fact, we have the artist's own testimony : of late years, I find that I like best to work out-of-doors.
First I make preliminary watercolor sketches in quarter scale ( approximately *f inches ) in which I pay particular attention to the design principles of three simple values -- the lightest light, the middle tone, and the darkest dark -- by reducing the forms of my subject to these large patterns.
If a human figure or wild life are to be part of the projected final picture, I try to place them in the initial sketch.
For me, these will belong more completely to their surroundings if they are conceived in this early stage, though I freely admit that I do not hesitate to add or eliminate figures on the full sheet when it serves my final purpose.
I am thoroughly convinced that most watercolors suffer because the artist expects nature will do his composing for him ; as a result, such pictures are only a literal translation of what the artist finds in the scene before him.
Just because a tree or other object appears in a certain spot is absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting, unless the position serves the design of the whole composition.
If the artist would study his work more thoroughly and move certain units in his design, often only slightly, finer pictures would result.
Out of long experience I have found that incidental figures and other objects like trees, logs, and bushes can be traced from the original sketch and moved about in the major areas on the final sheet until they occupy the right position, which I call clicking.
Speed in painting a picture is valid only when it imparts spontaneity and crispness, but unless the artist has lots of experience so that he can control rapid execution, he would do well to take these first sketches and soberly reorder their design to achieve a unified composition.
If I have seemed to emphasize the structure of the composition, I mean to project equal concern for color.
Often, in working out-of-doors under all conditions of light and atmosphere, a particular passage that looked favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright, too dull, or too light, or too dark when viewed indoors in a mat.
When this occurs, I make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor -- if I have been working on a full sheet in the field.
When working from one of my sketches I square it up and project its linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal.
When this linear draft is completed, I dust it down to a faint image.
From this point, I paint in as direct a manner as possible, by flowing on the washes with as pure a color mixture as I can manage.
However, first I thoughtfully study my sketch for improvement of color and design along the lines I have described.
Then I plan my attack : the parts I will finish first, the range of values, the accenting of minor details -- all in all, mechanics of producing the finished job with a maximum of crispness.
The longer I work, the more I am sure that for me, at least, a workmanlike method is important.
Trial and error are better placed in the preliminary sketch than in hoping for miracles in the final painting.
As for materials, I use the best available.
I work on a watercolor easel in the field, and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect my eyes from undue strain.
In my studio I work at a tilt-top table, but leave the paper unfixed so that I can move it freely to control the washes.
I have used a variety of heavy-weight hand-made papers, but prefer an English make, rough surface, in 400-pound weight.
After selecting a sheet and inspecting it for flaws ( even the best sometimes has foreign nubbins on its surface ), I sponge it thoroughly on both sides with clean, cold water.
Then I dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat as a board.
In addition to the usual tools, I make constant use of cleansing tissue, not only to wipe my brushes, but to mop up certain areas, to soften edges, and to open up lights in dark washes.
The great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it is easier to control than a sponge makes it an ideal tool for the watercolorist.
I also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large washes in the studio.
My brushes are different from those used by most watercolorists, for I combine the sable and the bristle.
The red sables are 8 ; two riggers, 6 and 10 ; and a very large, flat wash brush.
The bristles are a Fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shaved to a sharp chisel edge.
My usual palette consists of top-quality colors : alizarin crimson, orange, raw sienna, raw umber, burnt sienna, sepia, cerulean blue, cobalt blue, French ultramarine blue, Winsor green, Hooker's green 2, cadmium yellow pale, yellow ochre, Payne's gray, charcoal gray, Davy's gray, and ivory black.
In analyzing the watercolors of Roy Mason, the first thing that comes to mind is their essential decorativeness, yet this word has such a varied connotation that it needs some elaboration here.
True, a Mason watercolor is unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detailed inventory.
Unlike many decorative patterns that present a static flat convention, this artist's pictures are full of atmosphere and climate.
Long observation has taught Mason that most landscape can be reduced to three essential planes : a foreground in sharp focus -- either a light area with dark accents or a dark one with lights ; a middle distance often containing the major motif ; and a background, usually a silhouetted form foiled against the sky.
In following this general principle, Mason provides the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background, and the illusion of depth is instantly created.
When painting, Mason's physical eyes are half-closed, while his mind's eye is wide open, and this circumstance accounts in part for the impression he wishes to convey.
He does not insist on telling all he knows about any given subject ; rather his pictures invite the observer to draw on his memory, his imagination, his nostalgia.
It is for this reason that Roy avoids selecting subjects that require specific recognition of place for their enjoyment.
His pictures generalize, though they are inspired by a particular locale ; they universalize in terms of weather, skies, earth, and people.
By dealing with common landscape in an uncommon way, Roy Mason has found a particular niche in American landscape art.
Living with his watercolors is a vicarious experience of seeing nature distilled through the eyes of a sensitive interpretor, a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the Creator of it all.
The artist was born in Gilbert Mills, New York, in 1886, and until two years ago when he and his wife moved to California, he lived in western New York, in Batavia.
When I looked up the actual date of his birth and found it to be March 15th, I realized that Roy was born under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist : the water sign of Pisces ( February 18 thru March 20 ).
And how very often a water plane is featured in his landscapes, and how appropriate that he should appear in American Artist again, in his natal month of March ] over the years, beginning in 1929, Mason has been awarded seventeen major prizes including two gold medals ; two Ranger Fund purchase awards ; the Joseph Pennell Memorial Medal ; two American Watercolor Society prizes ; the Blair Purchase Prize for watercolor, Art Institute of Chicago ; and others in Buffalo, New York, Chautauqua, New Haven, Rochester, Rockport, and most recently, the $300 prize for a watercolor at the Laguna Beach Art Association, he was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate in the oil class in 1931 ( after receiving his first Ranger Fund Purchase Prize at the Academy in 1930 ), and elevated to Academicianship in 1940.
Other memberships include the American Watercolor Society, Philadelphia Water Color Club, Allied Artists of America, Audubon Artists, Baltimore Watercolor Society.
The Russian gymnasts beat the tar out of the American gymnasts in the 1960 Olympics for one reason -- they were better.
They were better trained, better looking, better built, better disciplined and something else -- they were better dancers.
Our athletes are only just beginning to learn that they must study dance.
The Russians are all trained as dancers before they start to study gymnastics.
But why gymnastics at all?
And is the sport really important?
After all, we did pretty well in some other areas of the Olympics competition.
But if it is important, what can we do to improve ourselves?
It is more than just lack of dance training that is our problem, for just as gymnastics can learn from dance, dance has some very important things to learn from gymnastics.
Taking first things first, let's understand the sport called gymnastics.
It is made up of tumbling, which might be said to start with a somersault, run through such stunts as headstands, handstands, cartwheels, backbends, and culminate in nearly impossible combinations of aerial flips and twists and apparatus work.
The apparatus used by gymnasts was once a common sight in American gyms, but about 1930 it was dropped in favor of games.
The parallel bars, horse, buck, springboard, horizontal bar, rings, and mats formerly in the school gyms were replaced by baseball, volleyball, basketball and football.
But the Russians use gymnastics as the first step in training for all other sports because it provides training in every basic quality except one, endurance.
The gymnast must develop strength, flexibility, coordination, timing, rhythm, courage, discipline, persistence and the desire for perfection.
In short, gymnastics uses every part of the body and requires a great deal of character as well.
The addition of endurance training later, when the body is mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury, provides that final quality that makes the top athlete, soldier or citizen.
Another reason gymnastic study is valuable is that it can be started very early in life.
( an enterprising teacher or parent could start training a healthy child at the age of seven days.
Most Europeans have been exercising newborn infants for centuries.
) in most sports, as in most walks of life, the angels are on the side of those who begin young, and the Russian competitor of 16 has at least thirteen years of training behind him.
The American is very lucky if he has three.
If a nation wished to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nations, it would start its kindergarten students on a program of gymnastics the day they entered and thus eliminate a large number of the problems that plague American schools.
First of the problems attacked would be fatigue and emotional tension, since action relieves both.
Oddly enough, it is proven that there would be less reading difficulty.
Certainly there would be less anxiety, fewer accidents ( it is the clumsy child who sustains the worst injuries ), and higher scholastic averages, since alert children work better.
Russia knows this, and that is why there were over 800,000 competing for places as candidates for the Olympic gymnastic team.
Eighty thousand won top honors and a chance to try for the team itself.
We could scarcely find eighty in our great land of over 180 million people.
And what has dancing to do with all this?
A great deal.
Russia's young gymnasts have studied dance before having the rigorous training on apparatus.
Well-stretched, trained in posture and coordinated movement, and wedded to rhythm, they presented the audiences in Rome with one of the most beautiful sights ever seen at any Olympic contest.
American audiences in particular learned two valuable lessons.
They saw completely masculine and obviously virile men performing with incredible grace.
They were further stripped of old wive's tales by seeing the slender, lovely Russian girls performing feats requiring tremendous strength and with not one bulging muscle.
President Kennedy has asked that we become a physically fit nation.
If we wait until children are in junior high or high school, we will never manage it.
To be fit, one has to start early with young children, and today the only person who really reaches such children is the teacher of dance.
If the dance teachers of America make it their business to prepare their young charges for the gymnastics that must come some day if our schools are really responsible, we will be that much ahead.
School teachers, all too unprepared for the job they must do, will need demonstrators.
There should be youngsters who know how to do a headstand, and also how to help other children learn it.
They should know simple exercises that could prepare less fortunate children for the sports we will demand be taught.
Dance teachers can respond to President Kennedy's request not only through their regular dance work, but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that makes for strength and flexibility.
Very little in today's living provides the strength we need and nothing provides the flexibility.
Dancers do have flexibility.
They often fail, however, to develop real abdominal, back, chest, shoulder and arm strength.
Ask any group of ballerinas to do ten push-ups or three chin-ups and the results, considering the amount of physical training they have had, will be very disappointing.
Even the boys will not be outstanding in these areas.
This isn't surprising when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boys in America cannot chin themselves once, and that English school girls outdo them in almost every test ( even dashes and endurance ).
The only area in which American boys hold their own is the baseball throw.
The chinning bar for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar is recommended.
It should be installed over a door that is in full view of everyone, and a chair should be placed under it, a little to one side.
Those children who can chin themselves should be told to do one chin-up each time they pass under it.
Those who are too weak, should climb on the chair and, starting at the top of the chin, let themselves slowly down.
When they can take ten seconds to accomplish the descent, they will have the strength to chin-up.
Parents should be informed about this system and encouraged to do the same with the whole family at home.
The horse kick arm, shoulder, chest, upper and lower back strength will be aided with the horse kick.
Start on hands and feet.
Keeping the hands in the starting position, run in place to a quick rhythm.
After this has become easy, use slower and slower rhythms, kicking higher and higher.
Follow this by crossing from one corner of the room to the other on all fours, kicking as high as possible.
Push-ups push-ups are essential, but few have the strength for them at first.
Start on the knees in a large circle.
Fall slowly forward onto the hands and let the body down to rest on the floor.
Push back up and repeat.
Do this exercise six times each class period.
As strength improves start in a standing position with legs wide apart and upper body bent forward.
Start by falling forward to a point close to the feet, and, as strength improves, fall farther and farther out.
Try to push back to the stand position from the stretched position without any intermediate pushes from the hands.
The push-up itself can be taught by starting at the top of the push-up with legs spread wide.
Let the body down slowly, taking at least five seconds for the letting down.
Five of these done daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up.
Handstands handstands come after arms, chest and shoulders have developed at least a minimum of strength.
Of course those who have developed more will find them easier.
Start with the class standing in a circle, with weight on the right foot and the left extended a little way into the circle.
At first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone, and those who need help.
Drop both hands to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back.
The left will follow at once.
The right will land first, followed by the left.
Return to the standing position.
Care should be taken to see that the hands are placed on the floor before the kick starts and also that the landing foot is brought as close to the hands as possible.
This will prevent flat falls and toe injuries.
Bare feet are better for such work than any form of slipper.
Eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the leading leg.
The child should then bring both legs together overhead, point the toes and tighten the seat muscles.
Be sure that the landing foot is brought close to the hands and that only one foot lands at a time.
Backbends the backbend is of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics, and, as with all acrobatics, the sooner begun the better the results.
Have the class lie supine with knees apart and bent.
Place flat palms on either side of the head a few inches away from the ears, fingers pointing toward the shoulders.
Arch the back upwards to make a bridge.
Be sure the head drops backward so that the child looks at the floor rather than toward the ceiling.
As flexibility improves, the feet will move closer to the hands and the bridge rise higher.
Later this can be combined with the handstand to provide a walkover.
Back circle to further increase back flexibility, work on the back circle.
Have the class lie prone.
Place the hands in front of the chest.
Keep the legs straight and the toes pointed.
Straighten the arms slowly, this arches the back.
At the peak of the arch, tip the head back and bend the knees in an effort to touch toes to head.
Improvement can be measured by the lessening distance between toes and head.
Somersaults the last essential to the beginner's gymnastic program is the somersault, or forward roll.
This used to be part of every child's bag of tricks, but few children can do it today ; some are actually incapable of rolling forward and are completely confused when not sitting or standing upright.
For most small children, learning a forward roll is simply a matter of copying another child who can.
After it has been seen, have the child start on a mat on hands and knees ( a thin, inexpensive mat is quite sufficient for anything that does not require falling ).
He places the hands on either side of the head, keeping the chin down on the chest.
He then pushes his seat into the air and the teacher guides it over.
One or two practice runs should be sufficient for solo.
If, however, the child is weak, overweight, or afraid, more help will be needed.
When the child raises his seat into the air, the teacher takes hold under both sides of the pelvis ; then no matter what happens, the child's performance will be controlled.
By lifting the seat upwards a little, the weight is taken off the neck and the back is kept rounded.
These are beginnings, but correctly learned they prepare for satisfying and exciting stunts that can be performed by a strong, flexible body ( we are not talking of eccentric extremes ).
Even if gymnastics are not the ultimate goal, the good tumbler will be a better dancer, a better athlete, and a human being with a greater margin of safety in any activity.
It is very important for parents to understand that early training is imperative.
And dancing school, so helpful in artistic and psychological development, also contributes to this essential early training -- and can contribute even more.
Every taxpayer is well aware of the vast size of our annual defense budget and most of our readers also realize that a large portion of these expenditures go for military electronics.
We have noted how some electronic techniques, developed for the defense effort, have evenutally been used in commerce and industry.
The host of novel applications of electronics to medical problems is far more thrilling because of their implication in matters concerning our health and vitality.
When we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment, the prospect is staggering.
The author has recently studied the field of medical electronics and has been convinced that, in this area alone, the application of electronic equipment has enormous possibilities.
The benefits electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be greater by far than any previous medical discovery.
We use the term bio-medicine because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research.
Electronics has been applied to medicine for many years in the form of such familiar equipment as the x-ray machine, the electrocardiograph, and the diathermy machine.
Recently many doctors have installed ultrasonic vibration machines for deep massage of bruises, contusions, and simple bursitis.
Commonly used electronic devices which are found in practically every hospital are closed-circuit *j and audio systems for internal paging and instruction, along with radiation counters, timers, and similar devices.
In this article we will concentrate on the advances in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratories because this is where tomorrow's commonplace equipment originates.
From the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic techniques perfected in the past few years we have selected a few examples which appear to be headed for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tools in medical research.
Ultraviolet microscopy many cells, bacteria, and other microorganisms are transparent to visible light and must be stained for microscopic investigation.
This stain often disrupts the normal cell activity or else colors only the outside.
A completely new insight into living cells and their structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replaces visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combines a microscope with a color-*t*v system to view the results.
Fig. 1 is a simplified block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system developed at the Medical Electronics Center of Rockefeller Institute.
By combining the talents of a medical man, Dr. Aterman, a biophysicist, Mr. Berkely, and an electronics expert, Dr. Zworykin, this novel technique has been developed which promises to open broad avenues to understanding life processes.
Three different wavelengths of ultraviolet radiation are selected by the variable filters placed in front of the three mercury xenon lights which serve as the ultraviolet sources.
These wavelengths are reflected in sequence through the specimen by the rotating mirror ; the specimen is magnified by the microscope.
Instead of the observer's eye the image orthicon in the *j camera does the looking.
The microscope and orthicon are both selected to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum, which means that all lenses must be quartz.
The video signal is amplified and then switched, in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light sources which are sequenced by the rotating mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength, corresponding to red, green, or blue, is seen.
( note : because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another, the lights are switched by a commutator-like assembly rotated by a synchronous motor.
This assembly also supplies a 20-cps switching gate for the electronics circuitry.
) this is the same system as was used in the field-sequential color-*t*v system which preceded the present simultaneous system.
Three separate amplifiers then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube.
The result is a color picture of the specimen where the primary colors correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelengths.
Many of the cells and microorganisms which are transparent to visible light, absorb or reflect the much shorter wavelengths of the ultraviolet spectrum.
Different parts of these cells sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelengths so that it is often possible to see internal portions of cells in a different color.
Where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadows or nothing at all, ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color *j picture reveal a wealth of detail.
At the present time the research team which pioneered this new technique is primarily interested in advancing and perfecting it.
Breathing -- electronically analyzed the medical title of Lobar Ventilation In Man by Drs. C. J. Martin and A. C. Young, covers a brief paper which is one part of a much larger effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process.
At the University of Washington Medical School, the electronics group has developed the Respiratory Gas Analyzer shown in Fig. 3.
This unit, affectionately dubbed The Monster, can be wheeled to any convenient location and provides a wealth of information about the patient's breathing.
In the lower center rack an 8-channel recorder indicates the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and lower lobes of one lung, the total volume of inhalation per breath, the flow of air from both lobes, and the pressure of the two lobes with respect to each other.
Usually the patient breathes into a mouthpiece while walking a treadmill, standing still, or in some other medically significant position.
From the resulting data the doctor can determine lung defects with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail.
Heart-measuring techniques the original electrocardiograph primarily indicates irregularities in the heartbeat, but today's techniques allow exact measurements of the flow of blood through the aorta, dimensioning of the heart and its chambers, and a much more detailed study of each heartbeat.
For many of these measurements the chest must be opened, but the blood vessels and the heart itself remain undisturbed.
A group of researchers at the University of Washington have given a paper which briefly outlines some of these techniques.
One simple method of measuring the expansion of the heart is to tie a thin rubber tube, filled with mercury, around the heart and record the change in resistance as the tube is stretched.
A balanced resistance bridge and a pen recorder are all the electronic instrumentation needed.
Sonar can be used to measure the thickness of the heart by placing small crystal transducers at opposite sides of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulsed ultrasonic energy.
The travel time of sound in tissue is about 1500 meters per second ; thus it takes about 16 Msec. to traverse 25 mm. of tissue.
A sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measuring system is required for body-tissue evaluation.
In addition to the heart and aorta, successful measurements of liver and spleen have also been made by this technique.
The Doppler effect, using ultrasonic signals, can be employed to measure the flow of blood without cutting into the blood vessel.
A still more sophisticated system has been devised for determining the effective power of the heart itself.
It uses both an ultrasonic dimensioning arrangement of the heart and a catheter carrying a thermistor inserted into the bloodstream.
The latter measures the heat carried away by the bloodstream as an indication of the velocity of the blood flow.
It is also possible to utilize a pressure transducer, mounted at the end of a catheter which is inserted into the heart's left ventricle, to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself.
This pressure measurement may be made at the same time that the ultrasonic dimensioning measurement is made.
A simplified version of the instrumentation for this procedure is shown in Fig. 2.
Outputs of the two systems are measured by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge, followed by a simple analogue computer which feeds a multichannel recorder.
From this doctors can read heart rate, change in diameter, pressure, and effective heart power.
Radio-transmitter pills several years ago headlines were made by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallowed by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receivers.
This original capsule contained a battery and a transistor oscillator and was about 1 cm. in diameter.
Battery life limited the use of this pill to about 8 to 30 hours maximum.
A refinement of this technique has been described by Drs. Zworykin and Farrar and Mr. Berkely of the Medical Electronics Center of the Rockefeller Institute.
In this novel arrangement the pill is much smaller and contains only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor is formed by a pressure-sensing transducer.
As shown in Fig. 4, an external antenna is placed over or around the patient and excited 3000 times a second with short 400-kc. bursts.
The energy received by the pill causes the resonant circuit to ring on after the burst and this ringing takes place at the resonant frequency of the pill.
These frequencies are amplified and detected by the *j receiver after each burst of transmitted energy and, after the pill has been calibrated, precise internal pressure indications can be obtained.
One of the advantages of this method is that the pill can remain in the patient for several days, permitting observation under natural conditions.
Applications to organs other than the gastrointestinal tract are planned for future experiments.
Sonar in medical research one of the most gratifying applications of an important technique of submarine detection is in the exploration of the human body.
Our readers are familiar with the principles of sonar where sound waves are sent out in water and the echoes then indicate submerged objects.
Various methods of pulsing, scanning, and displaying these sound waves are used to detect submarines, map ocean floors, and even communicate under water.
In medicine the frequencies are much higher, transducers and the sonar beams themselves are much smaller, and different scanning techniques may be used, but the principles involved are the same as in sonar.
Because the body contains so much liquid, transmission of ultrasonic signals proceeds fairly well in muscles and blood vessels.
Bones and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signals.
Based on this phenomenon, a number of investigators have used this method to look through human organs.
A good example of the results obtainable with ultrasonic radiation is contained in papers presented by Dr. G. Baum who has explored the human eye.
He can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional methods indicate blindness due to glaucoma.
The method used to scan the eye ultrasonically is illustrated in Fig. 6.
The transducer is coupled to the body through a water bath, not shown.
For display, Dr. Baum uses a portion of an *f, an airborne radar indicator, and then photographs the screen to obtain a permanent record.
A typical sonogram of a human eye, together with a description of the anatomical parts, is shown in Fig. 5.
The frequency used for these experiments is 15 mc. and the transducer is a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of providing beam diameters smaller than one millimeter.
The transducer itself moves the beam in a sector scan, just like a radar antenna, while the entire transducer structure is moved over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to look into all corners.
The total picture is only seen by the camera which integrates the many sector scans over the entire 90-degree rotation period.
Drs. Howry and Holmes at the University of Colorado Medical School have applied the same sonar technique to other areas of soft tissue and have obtained extremely good results.
By submerging the patient in a tub and rotating the transducer while the scanning goes on, they have been able to get cross-section views of the neck, as shown in Fig. 7, as well as many other hitherto impossible insights.
As mentioned before, bone reflects the sound energy and in Fig. 7 the portion of the spine shows as the black area in the center.
Arteries and veins are apparent by their black, blood-filled centers and the surrounding white walls.
A cross-section of a normal lower human leg is shown in Fig. 8 with the various parts labeled.
Oersted's boyhood represented a minimal chance of either attaining greatness or serving his people so well and over so long a span of life.
He was born in the small Danish town of Rudkoebing on the island of Langeland in the south-central part of Denmark on August 14, 1777.
His father Soeren was the village apothecary whose slender income made it difficult to feed his family, let alone educate them in a town without even a school.
The two older boys, Hans and Anders, his junior by a year, therefore went daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in German ; his wife taught the two boys to read and write Danish.
Other brothers later joined them for instruction with Oldenburg, the wigmaker, and also arithmetic was added to Bible reading, German, and Danish in the informal curriculum.
Oldenburg's contributions were soon exhausted and the boys had to turn to a wider circle of the town's learned, such as the pastor, to supplement the simple teaching.
From the town surveyor, Hans learned drawing and mathematics and, from a university student, some academic subjects.
The mayor of the town taught them English and French.
Whatever Hans or Anders learned separately they passed on to each other ; they read every book that they could borrow in the village.
At 12, Hans was sufficiently mature to help his father in the apothecary shop, which helped stimulate his interest in medicine and science.
His earlier love for literature and history remained with him for his entire life.
In 1793 the brothers decided to enter the University of Copenhagen ( founded in 1479 ) and the following spring found them at the university preparing to matriculate for the autumn session.
While Hans devoted himself to the sciences of medicine, physics, and astronomy, his brother studied law.
The brothers continued to help each other during their studies, sharing a joint purse, lodging together in the dormitory and dining together at the home of their aunt.
They supplemented their income by small government assistance, by tutoring and economizing wherever they could.
So impressive were those serious years of study at the university that Hans later wrote, to be perfectly free, the young man must revel in the great kingdom of thought and imagination ; there is a struggle there, in which, if he falls, it is easy for him to rise again, there is freedom of utterance there, which draws after it no irreparable consequences on society.
I lived in this onward-driving contest where each day overcame a new difficulty, gained a new truth, or banished a previous error.
He openly proclaimed his pleasure in lecturing and writing about science.
In this third year at the university, Hans, in 1797, was awarded the first important token of recognition, a gold medal for his essay on Limits Of Poetry And Prose.
He completed his training in pharmacy also, taking his degree with high honors in 1797, and in 1799 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine.
He proposed a fresh theory of alkalis which later was accepted in chemical practices.
Ferment of scientific activity Hans' student days were at a time when Europe was in a new intellectual ferment following the revolutions in America and in France, Germany and Italy were rising from divisive nationalisms and a strong wave of intellectual awareness was sweeping the Continent.
The new century opened with Oersted beginning his professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in Copenhagen and as lecturer at the university.
He was stirred by the announcement of Volta's discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately applied the voltaic pile to experiments with acids and alkalis.
The following year he devoted to the customary Wanderjahr, traveling in Germany, France, and the Netherlands, meeting the philosophers Schelling, Fichte, and Tieck.
He also met Count Rumford ( born Benjamin Thompson in Woburn, Mass. ) who was then serving the Elector of Bavaria, and the physicist Ritter ; these were Oersted's main contacts in science.
From Gottingen ( 1801 ) where he stayed for 10 days, he wrote, the first question asked everywhere is about galvanism.
As everybody is curious to see the battery of glass tubes I have invented, I have had quite a small one made here of four glass tubes ( in Copenhagen I used 30 ) and intend to carry it with me.
Oersted joined Ritter at Jena and stayed with him for 3 weeks, continuing their correspondence after he left.
With Ritter he was exposed to the fantastic profusion of ideas that stormed through his host's fertile but disorganized mind.
Oersted remodeled Ritter's notes into an essay in French which was submitted to the Institut De France for its annual prize of 3,000 francs.
The sound discoveries of this quixotic genius were so diluted by those of fantasy that the prize was never awarded to him.
In May, 1803, Ritter, in another flight of fancy, wrote to Oersted a letter that contained a remarkable prophecy.
He related events on earth to periodic celestial phenomena and indicated that the years of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincided with the years of important electrical discoveries.
Thus, 1745 corresponded to the invention of the Leiden jar by Kleist, 1764 that of the electrophorus by Wilcke, 1782 produced the condenser of Volta, and 1801 the voltaic pile.
Ritter proceeded, you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820, you will have to reckon.
This we might well witness.
Ritter died in 1810 and Oersted not only lived to see the event occur but was the author of it.
In 1803 Oersted returned to Copenhagen and applied for the university's chair in physics but was rejected because he was probably considered more a philosopher than a physicist.
However, he continued experimenting and lecturing, publishing the results of his experiments in German and Danish periodicals.
In 1806 his ambition was realized and he became professor of physics at the Copenhagen University, though not realizing full professorship ( ordinarius ) until 1817.
During Oersted's attendance at the university, it was poorly equipped with physical apparatus for experimenting in the sciences.
He was, however, fortunate in his contact with Prof. J. G. L. Manthey ( 1769-1842 ), teacher of chemistry, who, in addition to his academic chair, was also proprietor of the Lion Pharmacy in Copenhagen where Oersted assisted him.
Manthey maintained a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which was at Oersted's disposal during and after his graduation.
In 1800, Manthey went abroad and Oersted was appointed manager of the Lion Pharmacy.
In February 1801, Oersted did manage to experiment with physical apparatus and reported experiments made with a voltaic battery of 600 plates of zinc and silver and of later experiments with a battery of 60 plates of zinc and lead.
In the following year, 1803, Oersted, simultaneously with Davy, discovered that acids increased the strength of a voltaic battery more than did salts.
Eager as he was to pursue this promising line, he was so loaded down with the management of the pharmacy and lectures in the medical and pharmaceutical faculties at the university that he could devote only Sunday afternoons to galvanizing.
He assumed his academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that had marked every step in his rise from boyhood.
The university was the only one in Denmark and the status of professor represented the upper social level.
His broad interest in literary, political, and philosophical movements opened many doors to him.
His friends were numerous and their ties to him were strong.
The years 1812 and 1813 saw him in Germany and France again, but on this visit to Berlin he did not seek out the philosophers as he had on his first journey.
In Berlin he published his views of the chemical laws of nature in German and this was issued in French translation ( Paris, 1813 ) under the title Recherches Sur l'identite Des Forces chimiques et electriques, a work held in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemists.
His interest in finding a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism is here first indicated.
Chapter 8 is entitled On Magnetism and in it are included such remarks as, one has always been tempted to compare the magnetic forces with the electrical forces.
The great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attractions and repulsions and the similarity of their laws necessarily would bring about this comparison.
It is true that nothing has been found comparable with electricity by communication ; but the phenomena observed had such a degree of analogy to those depending on electrical distribution that one could not find the slightest difference.
The form of galvanic activity is halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form.
There, forces are more latent than in electricity, and less than in magnetism.
But in such an important question, we would be satisfied if the judgment were that the principal objection to the identity of forces which produce electricity and magnetism were only a difficulty, and not a thing which is contrary to it.
One could also add to these analogies that steel loses its magnetism by heat, which proves that steel becomes a better conductor through a rise in temperature, just as electrical bodies do.
It is also found that magnetism exists in all bodies of nature, as proven by Bruckmann and Coulomb.
By that, one feels that magnetic forces are as general as electrical forces.
An attempt should be made to see if electricity, in its most latent stage, has any action on the magnet as such.
His plan and intent were clearly charted.
Oersted returned in 1814 and resumed an active part in university and political discussions.
In one debate he supported the freedom of judgment as opposed to dogma, in another he held that the practice of science was in fact an act of religious worship.
He continued as a popular lecturer.
He devised a detonating fuse in which a short wire was caused to glow by an electric current.
In 1819 under royal command he undertook a very successful geological expedition to Bornholm, one of the Danish islands, being one of three scientists in the expedition.
It was with the assistance of one of the members of this expedition, Lauritz Esmarch, that Oersted succeeded in producing light by creating an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current was made to flow.
Together they also developed a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough was replaced by one of copper, thereby producing stronger currents.
Esmarch was among those who witnessed Oersted's first demonstration of his discovery.
Discovery of electromagnetism the association between electric ( both electrostatic and voltaic ) forces and magnetic forces had been recognized by investigators for many decades.
Electrical literature contained numerous references to lightning that had magnetized iron and had altered the polarity of compass needles.
In the late 1700's Beccaria and Van Marum, among others, had magnetized iron by sending an electrostatic charge through it.
Beccaria had almost stumbled on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a Leyden jar was sent transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel making its ends magnetic.
The resulting magnetic effect proved stronger than when the discharge was made lengthwise.
The experiments of Romagnosi and others have already been noted but no one had determined the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary forces.
Oersted's own earlier experiments were unimpressive, possibly because he had, like other experimenters, laid the conducting wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it.
The sequence of events leading to his important discovery still remains ambiguous but it seems that one of the advanced students at the university related that the first direct event that led to the publication of Oersted's discovery occurred during a private lecture made before a group of other advanced students in the spring of 1820.
At this lecture Oersted happened to place the conducting wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle.
Knowing specifically what the many feed additives can do and how and when to feed them can make a highly competitive business more profitable for beef, dairy, and sheep men.
The target chart quickly and briefly tells you which additives do what.
All the additives listed here are sanctioned for use by the Food and Drug Administration of the federal government.
All comments concerning effectiveness and use of drugs have been carefully reviewed by a veterinary medical officer with *j.
This article assumes that the rations you are feeding your beef, dairy cattle, and sheep are adequately balanced with protein, vitamins, and minerals.
The drug's chemical name is listed, since most states require feed processors to use this name instead of the trade name on the feed tag.
In some instances, the trade name is shown in parentheses following the chemical name.
This indicates that this drug is being marketed under one trade name only or state regulatory organizations have approved its use on the feed tag.
Here's your feed additive guide for ruminants : drug's chemical name : oxytetracycline hydrochloride ( Terramycin ) what it does : increases rate of gain and improves feed efficiency, aids in the prevention or treatment ( depending on level fed ) of the early stages of shipping fever, prevents or treats bacterial diarrhea, and aids in reducing incidence of bloat and liver abscesses.
Milk production may be increased by the anti-infective properties of this drug.
How to feed : beef cattle ( finishing ration ) -- to increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency, feed 75 milligrams per head in daily supplement.
Calves -- to increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency, feed 10 to 25 grams per ton of complete feed.
As an aid in the prevention of bacterial diarrhea ( scours ), feed 50 grams per ton of complete feed.
For the treatment of bacterial scours, feed 100-200 grams.
For prevention or treatment of bacterial scours, feed 0.1 to 5 milligrams per pound of body weight daily.
Beef and dairy -- as an aid in reducing incidence and severity of bloat, provide 75 milligrams of oxytetracycline hydrochloride per animal daily.
To reduce incidence of liver abscesses, supply 75 milligrams of oxytetracycline activity per head daily.
To prevent or treat bacterial diarrhea, furnish 0.1 to 5 milligrams per pound of body weight daily.
For the prevention or treatment of the early stages of shipping fever complex, increase feeding level to 0.5 to 2 grams per head per day.
For the best results, feed this level to cattle 3 to 5 days preceding shipment and/or 3 to 5 days following their arrival in your feed lot.
For treatment of shipping fever, this level should be fed at the onset of the disease symptoms until symptoms disappear.
Sheep -- to increase rate of gain and improve feed efficiency, feed 10 to 20 grams per ton.

There are three principal feed bunk types for dairy and beef cattle : ( 1 ) fence-line bunks -- cattle eat from one side while feed is put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagons ; ( 2 ) mechanized bunks -- they sit within the feed lot, are filled by a mechanical conveyor above feeding surface ; ( 3 ) special bunks -- as discussed here, they permit cattle to eat from all sides.
Feed is put in with an elevator.
Several materials or combinations of materials can be used to construct a satisfactory feed bunk.
The selection of materials depends on skills of available labor for installation, cost of materials available locally, and your own preference.
No one material is best for all situations.
Selecting bunks by economic comparison is usually an individual problem.
Fence-line feeding.
Animals eat only from one side, so the fence-line bunk must be twice as long as the mechanical bunk.
These bunks also serve as a fence, so part of the additional cost must be attributed to the fence.
Because of their location, on the edge of the feed lot, fence-line bunks are not in the way of mechanical manure removal.
Filling these bunks by the same self-unloading wagons used to fill silos spreads cost of the wagons over more time and operations.
All-weather roads must be provided next to the feeding floor so access will be possible all year.
This will be a problem in areas of heavy snowfall.
Marketing in the new decade will be no picnic -- for the sixties will present possibly the most intense competitive activity that you have experienced in the last 20-25 yrs..
Why?
Companies of all types have made great advances in production capabilities and efficiencies -- in modern equipment and new processes, enlarged R & D facilities, faster new product development.
Many companies have upgraded their sales manpower and tested new selling, distribution, and promotion techniques to gain a bigger competitive edge.
Given this kind of business climate, what competitive marketing problems will your company face in the next 10 yrs.?
Based on our experience with clients, we see 14 major problems which fall into three broad groups -- the market place itself, marketing methods, and marketing management.
1.
Problems in the market greater price-consciousness.
There has been an intensification of price-consciousness in recent years ; there is every indication it will continue.
Frequently, wittingly or unwittingly, price-consciousness has been fostered by manufacturers, distributors, and dealers.
Despite generally good levels of income, we see greater price pressures than ever before -- traveling back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer.
Here are some key areas to examine to make sure your pricing strategy will be on target : has the probable price situation in your field been forecast as a basis for future planning?
Have cost studies been made of every phase of your operation to determine what might be done if things get worse?
Have you actually checked out ( not just mentally tested ) different selling approaches designed to counter the price competition problem?
Increased customer sophistication.
Average consumer is becoming more sophisticated regarding product and advertising claims, partly because of widespread criticism of such assertions.
This problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kinds of businesses.
Have you examined this problem of increasing consumer sophistication from the standpoint of your own company?
Greater demand for services.
Need for service is here to stay -- and the problem is going to be tougher to solve in the sixties.
There are two reasons for this.
First, most products tend to become more complex.
Second, in a competitive market, the customer feels his weight and throws it around.
Providing good customer service requires as thorough a marketing and general management planning job as the original selling of the product.
Too often it is thought of at the last moment of new product introduction.
Good service starts with product design and planning : many products seem to be designed for a production economy, not for a service one.
Proper follow-through requires training your own sales organization, and your distributor organizations, not only in the techniques but also in good customer relations.
Have you assessed the importance of service and given it proper attention?
Wider discretionary choices for customers.
In spending his money today, the consumer is pulled in many directions.
To the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product -- the purchase of which can be switched, delayed, or put off entirely -- the implications are important.
Your competition is now proportionately greater -- you are competing not only against manufacturers in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturers of other appealing consumer products.
Many industry trade associations are developing campaigns to protect or enhance the share of the consumer's dollar being spent on their particular products.
Has your company thought through its strategy in this whole discretionary buying area?
Geographic shift of customers.
The trends have been in evidence for many years -- population shifts to the Southwest and Far West, and from city to suburbs.
These shifts will continue in the next 10 yrs..
Have you considered the implications of continuing geographic shifts in terms of sales force allocation, strength of distributor organizations, and even plant location?
Market concentration and distribution in fewer accounts.
We have already witnessed great changes through mergers and acquisitions in the food industry -- at both the manufacturing and retail ends.
Instead of relatively small sales to many accounts, there are now larger sales to or through fewer accounts.
The change may require different products, pricing, packaging, warehousing, salesmanship, advertising and executive attention -- practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjusted.
Have you examined these trends, forecast the effects, and planned your marketing strategy to compete effectively under changing circumstances?
2.
Problems in marketing methods more private label competition.
In the area of private label competition, it is logical to expect a continuation of trends which have been under way during the first decade.
As mass dealer and distributor organizations grow in size, there is every reason to expect them to try to share in the manufacturer's as well as the distributor's profits -- which is, in effect, what the sale of private brands tends to do.
Average manufacturer frequently has helped build private brand business, delivering largely the same qualities and styles in private brand merchandise as in branded.
Moreover, the larger and more aggressive mass distribution outlets and chain stores have insisted on high quality -- and the customer seems to have caught on.
If you are up against private brand competition, have you formulated a long-term program for researching and strengthening your market position?
If private brand competition hasn't been felt in your product field as yet, have you thought how you will cope with it if and when it does appear?
Less personal salesmanship.
Display merchandising, backed by pre-selling through advertising and promotion, will continue to make strides in the sixties.
It has multiple implications and possible headaches for your marketing program.
How can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationships with older existing outlets which are still important?
If you have a higher-quality product, how can you make it stand out -- justify its premium price -- without the spoken word?
Salesmanship is still necessary, but it's a different brand of salesmanship.
Have you carefully examined the selling techniques which best suit your products?
Have you studied the caliber and sales approaches of your sales force in relation to requirements for effective marketing?
Are you experimenting with different selling slants in developing new customers?
Higher costs of distribution generally.
Some distribution costs are kept up by competitive pressure, some by the fact that the customers have come to expect certain niceties and flourishes.
No manufacturer has taken the initiative in pointing out the costs involved.
The use of bulk handling is continuously growing.
Computers are being used to keep branch inventories at more workable levels.
Selective selling -- concentrating sales on the larger accounts -- has been used effectively by some manufacturers.
There may be possible economies at any one of a number of links in your marketing and distribution chain.
Do you have a program for scrutinizing all these links regularly and carefully -- and with some imagination?
In your sales force, will a smaller number of higher-priced, high-quality salesmen serve you best, or can you make out better with a larger number of lower-paid salesmen?
Will your trade customers settle for less attention and fewer frills in return for some benefit they can share?
In one company covering the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 men, the president personally phones each major account every 6 mos..
As a result, distribution costs were cut, customer relations improved.
Distribution costs are almost bound to increase in the sixties -- and you will never know what you can do to control them unless you study each element and experiment with alternative ways of doing the job.
Higher costs of advertising and promotion.
From the manufacturer's point of view, the increasing cost of advertising and promotion is a very real problem to be faced in the sixties.
It is accentuated by the need for pre-selling goods, and private label competition.
How much fundamental thinking and research has your company done on its advertising program?
Are you following competition willy-nilly -- trying to match dollar for dollar -- or are you experimenting with new means for reaching and influencing consumers?
Have you evaluated the proper place of advertising and all phases of promotion in your total marketing program -- from the standpoint of effort, money, and effectiveness?
Increasing tempo of new product development.
Practically all forecasts mention new and exciting products on the horizon.
Will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new products?
If competition beats you to it, this exciting new product era can have real headaches in store.
On the other hand, the process of obsoleting an old product and introducing the new one is usually mighty expensive.
As markets become larger and marketing more complex, the costs of an error become progressively larger.
Is your R & D or product development program tuned in to the commercial realities of the market?
Are there regular communications from the field, or meetings of sales and marketing personnel with R & D people?
Technical knowledge is a wonderful thing, but it's useless unless it eventually feeds the cash register.
Are there individuals in your organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization ; who can develop reliable estimates of sales volume, production, and distribution costs ; and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figures which management can act on with some assurance?
We have seen good new products shelved because no one had the assignment to develop such facts and plans -- and management couldn't make up its mind.
3.
Problems in marketing management shortage of skilled salesmen.
There is a shortage of salesmen today.
In the future, quantitative demand will be greater because of the expansion of the economy, and the qualitative need will be greater still.
While many companies have done fine work in developing sales personnel, much of it has been product rather than sales training.
Nor has the training been enough in relation to the need.
Most marketing people agree it is going to take redoubled efforts to satisfy future requirements.
Have you estimated your sales manpower needs for the future ( both quantitatively and qualitatively )?
Has your company developed selection and training processes that are geared to providing the caliber of salesmen you will need in the next 10 yrs.?
Shortage of sales management talent.
With the growing complexity of markets and intensity of competition, sales management, whether at the district, region or headquarters level, is a tough job today -- and it will be tougher in the future.
Men qualified for the broader task of marketing manager are even more scarce due to the demanding combination of qualifications called for by this type of management work.
The growth of business has outdistanced the available supply, and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties.
Does your company have a program for selecting and developing sales and marketing management personnel for the longer term?
Does your management climate and your management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people?
Complexity of complete marketing planning.
Every single problem touched on thus far is related to good marketing planning.
Hip-pocket tactics are going to be harder to apply.
Many food and beverage companies are already on a highly planned basis.
They have to be.
With greater investments in plant facilities, with automation growing, you can't switch around, either in volume or in product design, as much as was formerly possible -- or at least not as economically.
Are planning and strategy development emphasized sufficiently in your company?
We find too many sales and marketing executives so burdened with detail that they are short-changing planning.
Are annual marketing plans reviewed throughout your management group to get the perspective of all individuals and get everyone on the marketing team?
Do you have a long-term ( 5- or 10-yr. ) marketing program?
The key to effective marketing is wrapped up in defining your company's marketing problems realistically.
Solutions frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint your problems, whether they be in the market, in marketing methods or in marketing management.
If companies will take the time to give objective consideration to their major problems and to the questions they provoke, then a long constructive step will have been taken toward more effective marketing in next decade.
The controversy of the last few years over whether architects or interior designers should plan the interiors of modern buildings has brought clearly into focus one important difference of opinion.
The architects do not believe that the education of the interior designer is sufficiently good or sufficiently extended to compare with that of the architect and that, therefore, the interior designer is incapable of understanding the architectural principles involved in planning the interior of a building.
Ordinary politeness may have militated against this opinion being stated so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both groups and who has sat through the many round tables, workshops or panel discussions -- whatever they are called -- on this subject will recognize that the final, boiled down crux of the matter is education.
It is true that most architectural schools have five year courses, some even have six or more.
The element of public danger which enters so largely into architectural certification, however, would demand a prolonged study of structure.
This would, naturally, lengthen their courses far beyond the largely esthetic demands of interior designer's training.
We may then dismiss the time difference between these courses and the usual four year course of the interior design student as not having serious bearing on the subject.
The real question that follows is -- how are those four years used and what is their value as training?
The American Institute of Interior Designers has published a recommended course for designers and a percentage layout of such a course.
An examination of some forty catalogs of schools offering courses in interior design, for the most part schools accredited by membership in the National Association of Schools of Art, and a further on the spot inspection of a number of schools, show their courses adhere pretty closely to the recommendations.
One or two of the schools have a five year curriculum, but the usual pattern of American education has limited most of them to the four-year plan which seems to be the minimum in acceptable institutions.
The suggested course of the A.*i.*d. was based on the usual course offered and on the opinion of many educators as to curricular necessities.
Obviously, the four year provision limits this to fundamentals and much desirable material must be eliminated.
Without comparing the relative merits of the two courses -- architecture versus interior design -- let us examine the educational needs of the interior designer.
To begin with, what is an interior designer?
The Dictionary Of Occupational Titles published by the U. S. Department of Labor describes him as follows : designs, plans and furnishes interiors of houses, commercial and institutional structures, hotels, clubs, ships, theaters, as well as set decorations for motion picture arts and television.
Makes drawings and plans of rooms showing placement of furniture, floor coverings, wall decorations, and determines color schemes.
Furnishes complete cost estimates for clients approval.
Makes necessary purchases, places contracts, supervises construction, installation, finishing and placement of furniture, fixtures and other correlated furnishings, and follows through to completion of project.
In addition to this the U. S. Civil Service Bureau, when examining applicants for government positions as interior designers, expects that when various needed objects are not obtainable on the market he will design them.
He must be capable of designing for and supervising the manufacture of any craft materials needed in the furnishings.
This seems like a large order.
The interior designer, then, must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and lighting and plumbing and finance.
Yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer does know all this and does practice it.
And further he must understand his obligation to the client to not only meet his physical necessities but also to enhance and improve his life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of our society.
Few will quarrel with the aim of the schools or with the wording of their curriculum.
It is in the quality of the teaching of all this that a question may arise.
The old established independent art schools try their best to fulfill their obligations.
Yet even here many a problem is presented ; as in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command -- design a luxury apartment ; no description of the client or his cultural level, no assertion of geographical area or local social necessities -- simply a luxury apartment.
Working in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show pieces that look good in exhibitions and catalogs and may please the public relations department but have little to do with the essence of interior design.
It is possible, of course, to work on extant or projected buildings where either architect or owner will explain their necessities so that the student may get the feel of real interior design demands.
Unfortunately, the purely synthetic problem is the rule.
It is like medical schools in India where, in that fairy-land of religious inhibition, the dissection of dead bodies is frowned upon.
Instead they learn their dissection on the bulbs of plants.
Thus technical efficiency is achieved at the expense of actual experience.
In the earlier years of training certain phases of the work must be covered and the synthetic problem has its use.
But to continue to divorce advanced students from reality is inexcusable.
Consultation with architects, clients, real estate men, fabric houses and furniture companies is essential to the proper development of class problems just as in actual work.
Fortunately, although only a few years ago they held the student at arms length, today the business houses welcome the opportunity to aid the student, not only from an increased sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today is the interior designer of tomorrow -- that the student already is in the trade.
Even the history of furniture can hardly be taught exclusively from photographs and lantern slides.
Here, too, the reality of actual furniture must be experienced.
The professional organizations such as American Institute of Interior Designers, National Society of Interior Designers, Home Fashions League and various trade associations, can and do aid greatly in this work.
Certainly every educator involved in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organizations.
Not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expected to be a member of one of the professional organizations, but his first qualification for membership as an educator should be so sharply scrutinized that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject.
Participation for the educator in this case, however, would have to be raised to full and complete membership.
The largest of these organizations at present denies to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standards of the group and, indeed, refuses him even the right to attach the customary initials after his name in the college catalog.
This anomalous status of the educator cannot fail to lower his standing in the eyes of the students.
The professor in turn dares not tolerate the influence in his classes of an organization in the policies and standards of which he has no voice.
This seems somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualifications for membership which the organizations profess are ever enforced, the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in his hands.
In one way the Institutes and Societies do a disservice to the schools.
That is in the continuance of the grandfather clauses in their membership requirements.
When these groups were first formed many prominent and accomplished decorators could not have had the advantage of school training since interior design courses were rare and undeveloped during their youth.
Long hard years of on the job training had brought them to their competence.
The necessity of that day has long disappeared.
There is plenty of opportunity for proper education today.
It is discouraging for students to realize that the societies do not truly uphold the standards for which they are supposed to stand.
The reason and the day of grandfather clauses has long since passed.
No one can deny that these back door admissions to membership provisions have been seriously abused nor that they have not resulted in the admission of downright incompetents to membership in supposedly learned societies.
Beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teachers themselves.
It will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education, a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessities of his course plus complete dedication to his subject and to his students.
The local decorator who rushes in for a few hours of teaching may but more likely may not have these qualifications.
Nor will the hack, the Jack-of-all-trades, still found in some of the smaller art schools, suffice.
Only a few years ago a middle western college circulated a request for a teacher of interior design.
At the end of its letter was the information that applicants for this position must also be prepared to teach costume design and advertising art.
This kind of irresponsibility toward their students can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer.
We must build a corps of highly professional teachers of interior design who have had education, experience in the profession and are willing to take on the usual accompaniments of teaching -- minimal income and minimal status among their confreres.
Considerable specialization in teaching subjects such as architecture, furniture design, textiles and color is also desirable.
In all degree courses in interior design a number of academic or general studies courses are included.
It is only fair to demand that teachers of courses in English, history, psychology and so on be as well informed in matters of art, especially interior design, as are the art teachers educated in the academic subjects.
The proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieved only if this standard is observed.
The matter of sympathy of the academic professors for art objectives also must be taken into account.
One technical question of school organization comes to mind here.
For proper accreditation of schools, teachers in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student is a candidate.
Since there are almost no schools in the country offering graduate work in interior design this rule cannot at present be observed.
Indeed, it has only been a matter of the last few years that reputable schools of art have granted degrees at all.
The question, however, cannot be ignored for long.
The basic problem involved is that a college setting up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advanced degree.
Most professors in the course must, naturally, again have a higher degree than the course offers.
One solution is the aquisition of degrees in education but it is a poor substitute.
It is a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it.
This brings us to the question of accreditation of art schools in general.
Only the independent art schools, that is, those not connected with any university or college, receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organizations.
It has been the custom for most universities to stretch the blanket of accreditation for their liberal arts school to cover the shivering body of their fine arts department.
This, plus the habit of many schools of simply adding interior design to the many subjects of their home economics department, yet, nevertheless, claiming that they teach interior design, has contributed to the low repute of many university courses in interior design.
In spite of this, many universities offer adequate and even distinguished courses in the subject.
There will be no mitigation of these offences until all art schools, whether independent or attached to universities have separate accreditation -- as do medical schools -- by an art accreditation group such as the National Association of Schools of Art.
Independent art schools granting degrees must, naturally, follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group.

Are you utilizing vending machine proceeds to help pay for your program?
Transportation and parking do you know the trend in your cost of maintaining access roads and parking lots?
If you use parking attendants, can they be replaced by automatic parking gates?
Will your local bus company erect and/or maintain the bus stops at your plant?
If you provide inter-plant transportation, can this be replaced by available public transportation?
If you use company transportation to meet trains or to haul visitors, would taxis be cheaper?
How efficient and necessary are your intra-company vehicles?
Can they be re-scheduled?
Can part-time drivers be assigned to other productive work?
Paid vacations which is more economical for your plant -- a vacation shutdown or spaced vacations that require extra employees for vacation fill-ins?
Can vacations be spaced throughout the 12 months to minimize the number of employee fill-ins?
Do you insist that unneeded salary employees take their vacations during plant shutdowns?
What can your sales and purchasing departments do to curtail orders, shipments, and receipts during vacation shutdown periods?
Retirement is an arbitrary retirement age of 65 actually costing your plant money?
What sort of effort do you make to assure that older or disabled workers are fully productive?
Would early retirement of non-productive, disabled employees reduce the number of make-work jobs?
Will your union accept seniority concessions in assigning work for older or disabled employees?
Medical and health can you share medical facilities and staff with neighboring plants?
If you have a full-time doctor now, can he be replaced with a part-time doctor or one who serves on a fee-per-case basis only?
Can your plant nurse be replaced by a trained first-aid man who works full-time on some other assignment?
Do you rigidly distinguish between job- and non-job-connected health problems and avoid treating the latter?
Are you indiscriminantly offering unnecessary medical services -- flu shots, sun lamp treatments, etc.?
If you have an annual or regular physical examination program, is it worth what it is costing you?
A program to fit your needs consider what you can afford to spend and what your goals are before setting up or revamping your employee benefit program.
Too many plant officials are all too eager to buy a package program from an insurance company simply because it works for another plant.
But even if that other plant employs the same number of workers and makes the same product, there are other facts to consider.
How old is your working force?
What's your profit margin?
In what section of the country are you located?
Are you in a rural or urban area?
These factors can make the difference between waste and efficiency in any benefit program.
Above all, don't set up extravagant fringe benefits just to buy employee good will.
Unions stress fringe benefits, but the individual hourly worker prefers cash every time.
Aim to balance your employee benefit package.
Some plants go overboard on one type of fringe -- say a liberal retirement plan -- and find themselves vulnerable elsewhere.
They're asking for union trouble.
Communications if you want credit for your employee services program, let your workers know what they're entitled to.
Encourage them to exercise their benefits.
This can be done by stories in your house organs, posters, special publications, letters to workers' homes as well as by word of mouth through your chain of command.
Some companies find a little imagination helpful.
Hallmark Cards, Inc., Kansas City, Mo., has a do-it-yourself quiz game called Benefit Bafflers, which it distributes to employees.
*j & *j Dietetic Laboratories, Inc., Columbus, gives all its workers a facsimile checkbook -- each check showing the amount the company spends on a particular fringe.
U. S. Rubber Company, New York, passes out a form itemizing the value of benefits.
The blue-collar worker thus knows his insurance package, for example, costs $227.72.
Insurance have the insurance company or your own accounting department break down the cost of your insurance package periodically.
You may find certain coverage costing much more than is economically feasible, thereby alerting you to desirable revisions.
Check to see if some of your benefits -- such as on-the-job disability pay -- can be put on a direct payment rather than an insured basis at a savings to you.
Use deductable insurance wherever feasible.
It can put an end to marginal claims which play havoc with your insurance rates.
Also, beware of open-end policies, especially in the medical field.
This will mean that every time there's an increase in hospital rates your cost will go up in like manner.
Put a dollar-and-cents limit on benefits.
Don't go overboard on insurance that pays benefits only upon death.
Generally, your employee will greatly appreciate benefits that protect him during his working life or during retirement.
Special time off in granting bereavement leaves, specify the maximum time off and list what the worker's relation to the deceased must be to qualify.
Thus, you avoid headaches when an employee wants off for his fourth cousin's funeral.
Also, reserve the right to demand proof of death despite the fact that you'll probably never use it.
Coffee breaks can be a real headache if not regulated.
Vending machines can alleviate the long hike to the cafeteria during the break with resulting waste of production time.
If coffee is sold at the cafeteria, let a few workers in each department get it for the whole group.
Consider installing supplemental serving lines in production areas.
Make sure milk for the coffee is placed in dispensers rather than in containers, if you are supplying the coffee.
Otherwise, you may be saddled with a good-size milk bill by milk drinkers.
Retirement policies keep the retirement age flexible so skilled craftsmen such as tool and die makers can be kept on the job for the convenience of the company.
And so deadheads on the payroll can be eased out at the earliest possible age.
Make sure you have minimum age and time-on-the-job requirements tied into your pension plan.
Younger men usually don't think of pensions as an important job benefit factor anyhow and they're liable to change jobs several times before settling down.
Choose carefully between contributory or non-contributory pension plans.
There are two sides of a coin for this decision.
Workers usually think more of a plan they contribute to.
And they can at least collect the money they put in, plus interest, when they leave the company.
A non-contributory plan usually won't pay off for the worker until he retires.
Thus, there is an added incentive to stay on the job.
Holidays make sure you don't pay for holidays that occur when an employee would not otherwise be working.
These include : leaves of absences, illnesses, and layoffs.
Consider adopting a system of holidays in which time off is granted with an eye to minimum inconvenience to the operation of the plant.
It's usually not too hard to sell workers on this as it gives them longer holiday periods.
For example, the Friday after Thanksgiving can be substituted for Washington's birthday.
This reduces the number of expensive plant shutdowns and startups.
Require each employee to work his last shift both before and after the holiday to be eligible for pay.
This cuts the absentee rate.
Eating facilities consider using vending machines rather than subsidized cafeterias.
Latest models serve hot meals at reasonable prices, and at a profit to you.
If a concessionaire runs the cafeteria, keep an eye out for quality and price.
If the soup tastes like dishwater, your employees won't blame the concessionaire.
You'll take the rap.
Check your cafeteria location to make sure it's convenient for most employees.
You may save valuable production minutes with a change.
Vacations spread your vacation period over the widest possible span of time or shut the plant down for two weeks.
This will cut the expense of vacation replacements.
And with the shutdown method there will be no argument as to who gets the choice vacation dates.
Also make sure you have reasonable requirements as to hours worked before a production employee is entitled to a vacation.
You might try providing standard vacation time off but make the vacation pay depend on the number of hours worked in the previous year.
The long and ever-increasing column of sportsmen is now moving into a new era.
Modern times have changed the world beyond recognition.
The early years of the twentieth century seem very far away.
But with all the changes in philosophy, dress and terrain -- a few things remain constant, including the devotion of Americans to the great field sports, hunting and fishing.
As the generations move on, clothes become more suitable for the enjoyment of outdoor sports.
Sporting firearms change, markedly for the better.
Just as modern transportation has outmoded the early Studebaker covered wagon, the demand of today's sportsmen and women has necessitated changes in their equipment.
The American firearms and ammunition manufacturers through diligent research and technical development have replaced the muzzle loader and slow-firing single-shot arms with modern fast firing auto-loaders, extremely accurate bolt, lever, and slide action firearms.
And millions of rounds of entirely new and modern small-arms ammunition, designed for today's hunting and target shooting.
And due to modern resource-use and game management practices, there is still game to shoot, even with the ever-expanding encroachment on land and water.
Present conservation practices regard wildlife, not as an expendable natural resource, but as an annual harvest to be sown and also reaped.
Unlimited game bags are possible and legal in more than 40 states, on shooting preserves ( one of the newer phases of modern game-management ) for five and six months each year.
Close to two million game birds were harvested on 1,500 commercial and private shooting preserves, and on State Game Commission-controlled upland game areas during the 1960-61 season.
The shooting development program of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers' Institute has successfully published these facts in all major outdoor magazines, many national weeklies and the trade papers.
The most effective way to develop more places for more sportsmen to shoot is to encourage properly managed shooting preserves.
This has been the aim of the director of the shooting development program, the New York staff of the Sportsmen's Service Bureau, and the *j shooting preserve field consultants since the start of the program in 1954.
Following the kick-off of *j shooting development program in 1954, a most interesting meeting took place in Washington, D.*c..
The group known as the American Association for Health, Physical Education, and Recreation ( a division of the National Education Association ) initiated a conference which brought together representatives of the National Rifle Association, *j and the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers.
This meeting was called to determine how these groups might cooperate to launch what is known as the Outdoor Education Project.
The Outdoor Education Project took cognizance of the fact, so often overlooked, that athletic activities stressed in most school programs have little or no relationship to the physical and mental needs and interests of later life.
The various team sports assuredly have their place in every school, and they are important to proper physical development.
But with the exception of professional athletes, few contact sports and physical education activities in our schools have any carryover in the adult life of the average American man or woman.
Following a vigorous campaign of interpretation and leadership development by *j director Dr. Julian Smith, today thousands of secondary schools, colleges and universities have shooting and hunting education in their physical education and recreation programs.
S*a*a*m*i's financial support since 1955 has contributed to the success of this project in education.
Personnel assigned through the shooting development program have proudly participated in over 53 state and regional workshops, at which hundreds of school administrators, teachers, professors, and recreational leaders have been introduced to Outdoor Education.
Considering that the current school-age potential is 23 million youths, the project and its message on hunting and shooting education have many more to reach.
In 1959 *j shooting development program announced a new activity designed to expose thousands of teen-age boys and girls to the healthy fun enjoyed through the participation in the shooting sports.
This program is now nationally known as Teen Hunter Clubs.
Teen Hunter Clubs were initially sponsored by affiliated members of the Allied Merchandising Corporation.
The first program was sponsored by Abraham & Strauss, Hempstead, New York, under the direction of Special Events director Jennings Dennis.
Other pilot programs were conducted by *j & *j, Babylon, New York ; J. L. Hudson, Detroit ; Joseph Horne, Pittsburgh.
Other *j activities followed, conducted by shopping centers, department stores, recreation equipment dealers, radio-*t*v stations, newspapers, and other organizations interested in the need existing to acquaint youngsters with the proper use of sporting firearms and the development of correct attitudes and appreciations related to hunting and wise use of our natural resources.
S*a*a*m*i's field men have served as consultants and/or have participated in 75 Teen Hunter Club activities which have reached over 40,000 enthusiastic young Americans.
Through the efforts of *j shooting development program these shooting activities, and many others, including assists in the development of public and privately financed shooting parks, trap and skeet leagues, rifle and pistol marksmanship programs have been promoted, to mention only a few.
The continuation and expansion of the shooting development program will assure to some degree that national and community leaders will be made aware of the ever-growing need for shooting facilities and activities for hunting and shooting in answer to public demand.
While individual sportsmen are aware of this situation, too many of our political, social, educational and even religious leaders too often forget it.
Help is needed from dealers, at the grass-roots level.
The American gun and ammunition producers sponsor a successful promotional program through their industry trade association.
Since *j conception in 1926, and more specifically since the adoption of the Shooting Development Program in 1954, millions of dollars and promotional man-hours have gone into the development of more places to shoot for more youths and adults.
We trust that you, as a gun and ammunition dealer, have benefited through additional sales of equipment.
Are you getting top dollar from the shooting sports?
Are you looking ahead to the exploding market of millions of American boys and girls, who will grow up to enjoy a traditional American way of life -- ranging the fields with a fine American gun and uniformly excellent ammunition?
Is your sporting firearms and ammunition department primed for the expanding horizons?
Would you like to organize Teen Hunters Clubs, shooting programs, and have information on seasons including six months of hunting with unlimited game bags on shooting preserves?
Ask Sammy Shooter.
We were camping a few weeks ago on Cape Hatteras Campground in that land of pirates, seagulls and bluefish on North Carolina's famed Outer Banks.
This beach campground with no trees or hills presents a constant camping show with all manner of equipment in actual use.
With the whole camp exposed to view we could see the variety of canvas shelters in which Americans are camping now.
There were umbrella tents, wall tents, cottage tents, station wagon tents, pup tents, Pop tents, Baker tents, tents with exterior frames, camper trailers, travel trailers, and even a few surplus parachutes serving as sunshades over entire family camps.
Moving around camp we saw all kinds of camp stoves, lanterns, coolers, bedding, games, fishing tackle, windbreaks and sunshades.
We saw similar displays in the other three campgrounds in this 70-mile-long National Seashore Recreation Area.
Dealers would do well to visit such a campground often, look at the equipment and talk with the campers.
Here you begin to appreciate the scope of the challenges and possibilities facing the industry.
Camping is big and getting bigger.
No one knows where it will stop.
Almost every official who reflects on it thinks this movement of Americans to canvas dwellings opens one of the most promising of all outdoor markets.
You read various guesses on how many Americans are camping.
The number depends on who is talking at the moment.
The figures range as high as 15 million families.
I've heard 10 million mentioned often, but I'm more inclined to think there may be a total of some five to seven million families camping.
Seven million families would total 30 million Americans or more.
Consider the equipment needed to protect this many from the weather, to make their cooking easy and their sleeping comfortable.
More campers than campsites harassed state park officials often have more campers than they know what to do with.
They are struggling to meet the demand for camping space, but families are being turned away, especially on holiday weekends.
The National Parks, always popular camping places, are facing the same pressure.
The National Park Service hopes by 1966 to have 30,000 campsites available for 100,000 campers a day -- almost twice what there are at present.
The U.*s. Forest Service cares for hundreds of thousands of campers in its 149 National Forests and is increasing its facilities steadily.
But the campers still come.
They bring their families and tents and camp kitchens and bedding.
They bring their fishing rods and binoculars and bathing suits.
They come prepared for family fun because Americans in ever-growing numbers are learning that here is the way to a fine economical vacation that becomes a family experience of lasting importance.
Why they keep coming there are a half dozen reasons helping to account for the migration to the campgrounds.
Among them, according to the U.*s. Department of Commerce, are : ( 1 ) shorter work weeks, ( 2 ) higher pay, ( 3 ) longer paid vacations, ( 4 ) better transportation, ( 5 ) earlier retirement, and ( 6 ) more education.
The more people learn about their country, the more they want to learn.
Camping is family fun, and it is helping more Americans see more of the country than they ever saw before.
But make no mistake about it, the first reason people turn to camping is one of economy.
Here is the promise of a vacation trip they can afford.
The American Automobile Association, computing the cost for two people to vacation by automobile, comes up with an average daily expenditure figure of $29.
The *j then splits it down this way : $10.50 for meals, $9.50 for lodging, $7 for gas and oil, and $2 for tips and miscellaneous.
What does the camping couple do to this set of figures?
The $9.50 for lodging they save.
Because they prepare their own meals they also keep in their pockets a good portion of that $10.50 food bill along with most of the tip money.
The automobile expenses are about the only vacationing cost they can't either eliminate or pare down drastically by camping along the way.
Where Americans used to think of a single vacation each summer, they now think about how many vacations they can have.
Long weekends enable many to get away from home for three or four days several times a year.
And even if they stay in resorts part of the time, they might, if the right salesman gets them in tow, develop a yearning to spice the usual vacation fare with a camping trip into the wide open spaces.
It would be a mistake to sell those thousands of beginning campers on the idea they're buying the comforts of home.
They're not.
Home is the place to find the comforts of home.
They're buying fun and adventure and family experiences.
But it would also be a mistake for them not to realize how comfortable camping has become.
This is no longer a way of life for the bearded logger and the wandering cowboy.
Today's campers want comforts, and they have them.
And this helps explain why so many people are now going camping.
It's fun, and it's easy -- so easy that there is time left after cooking, and tent keeping, for the women to get out and enjoy outdoor fun with their families.
Camp meals are no great problem.
Neither are beds, thanks to air mattresses and sleeping bags.
Neither are shelters, because there is one to meet the needs of every camper or prospective camper.
But there is still the sometimes complex problem of helping campers choose the best equipment for their individual needs.
Throughout history, the man who showed superior performance has become the commander of others -- for good or bad.
Since the Industrial Revolution, when factories emerged, this classical pattern has been followed.
Until recently.
There have always been tales of disillusionment -- the competent technician who became an administrator, willingly or not, and found he didn't like it ; the scientist who rebelled against the personnel and paper work ; and much more commonly in recent years, the engineer who found that other duties interfered with -- or eliminated -- his engineering contributions.
There have been many extremely competent men who have been converted into very incompetent managers or submerged in paper work, to their own and the public's dissatisfaction and loss.
This has been more evident since our products have incorporated astronomically increased technology.
The remedies have been many and varied -- attempts to teach management techniques -- either in plant, at special schools, or in university crash courses -- provision of management-trained assistants or associates.
But the realization has been growing that these are not the complete answer.
Some men have no talent for or interest in management ; forcing them into management can only create trouble.
The old shop adage still holds : a good mechanic is usually a bad boss.
Yet our economy clings inexorably to recognition of managerial status as the gage of success.
Labor fights to change its collar from blue to white.
All grades of management seek more resounding titles and incomes because of social pressures.
As several recent books have over-emphasized, we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world.
What can be done for the individual contributor who is extremely important -- and likely to be more so -- in the operation of the technically oriented company?
He is usually conscious of the social pressures at home and outside ; usually concerned about America's belief that attainment and success are measured in dollars and titles.
Yet titles are traditionally given only to management men, and income tends to rise with title.
Even the college professor in America has been affected.
It is, as one engineer says, indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go as far on his technical merit as he could employing managerial skills.
This difficulty arises even though we can give examples of men who have actually followed this course.
This leads one to conclude, as you have, that there is inevitably more prestige in a management position in the minds of our people.
Nobody should be more able to answer the questions on this score than engineering vice-presidents and chief engineers.
So we asked such men in major companies in the design field to offer their opinions on the dual-road-up problem -- and more importantly -- their solutions.
In the paragraphs that follow, we quote from 32 men who are identified on the final page.
First : what title, what setup?
Among the more familiar plans for dual-channel advancement is that of General Electric.
This is not a mutually exclusive plan ; there is no one point in a man's career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward.
Further, the management path does not open the door to higher opportunities than are offered by the more technical path.
It is common to shift back and forth, working up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor positions.
Actually, there are a number of individual-contributor positions in both operating departments and in the company-wide services operation that are filled by men with successful managerial experience who are currently broadening their capabilities.
Also, moving into a managerial position does not necessarily end a man's recognition as a technical expert.
As examples at *j : Glen B. Warren, formerly manager of the Turbine Division, widely recognized as a turbine designer.
The late W. R. G. Baker, a pioneer in television design and long-time *j & *j of the Electronics Division, and later, by his own choice, an individual consultant.
Harold E. Strang, expert in switchgear design, for a long period *j & *j of the Measurements & Industrial Products Division, and who currently, approaching retirement, is vice-president and consulting engineer in the Switchgear & Control Division.
In the *j plan, a number of individual contributors have positions and compensation higher than those of many managers.
These positions carry such titles as : Consultant, Advanced Development Consulting Engineer, Consulting Engineer, Heat Transfer Consulting Electrical Engineer, Senior Electrical Engineer, Senior Physicist.
Westinghouse has a similar system, with two classifications representing various levels of competence on the strictly technical side : consulting engineer or scientist, as the case may be, and advisory engineer or scientist.
Many companies have systems, particularly in *j & *j, which work more or less well, depending upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration, as will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotations.
Another factor that may hold hope is for parallel recognition is, as one man says it : that the fad for educating top people along managerial lines is yielding to the technically trained approach.
Senior staff engineer?
One company instituted, early in 1959, a vertical classification system consisting of four levels.
There is no formal equivalence to the supervisory ranks ; the top non-supervisory level, senior staff engineer, enjoys status and pay ranging up to that for the second level of engineering supervision.
The second level, senior engineer, rates slightly below first-level supervision.
The expectation is that first-level supervisors will be selected in approximately equal numbers from the second and third engineering level, with very few coming from the first level.
The company expects to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineers, but probably not into executive levels.
In this organization, about half of the engineers with 15 or more years of employment are in supervision, engineering or elsewhere.
This reflects the very heavy engineering content of the products -- which are not military.
Several other examples : central and satellite we have over 20 divisions -- each of which has an engineering department headed by a chief engineer.
We have set up a central *j & *j department, as well as engineering-management departments -- about 80 people working on problems related to those of our plants.
A separate research department is, of course, confined to new or future designs.
Part of this headquarters staff, however, are engineering managers who work between divisional chief engineers and headquarters management.
These headquarters engineers, headed by the vice-president -- engineering, counsel and advise divisional managers and chief engineers on product problems as well as aid with design ; and many are engineers who have been advanced from the divisions.
These men are considered managers of engineers.
They must learn to wear several hats, so to speak, working with management, sales and engineering problems related to the product.
We do not have people in our organization termed consultants or fellows, who are specialists in one particular technical subject.
I suppose it is because we are just not big enough.
We have a few consultants -- retired engineers retained and called in on certain problems.
The only fellows in our company are those who have been honored by *j, *j or *j.
I am sure that the engineer who enters management is nearly always opening the door to greater possibilities than he would have as a technical specialist -- because of his wider accountability.
Another structure we have tried to make both paths attractive, so that good men could find opportunity and satisfaction in either.
One way to formalize this is in the job structure.
We have these positions, which compare directly : *f above these jobs we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of *j, *j & *j.
The latter jobs include major management responsibilities and have been filled by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side.
We have not yet succeeded in establishing recognition of technical specialization comparable to our higher levels of management, but I believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president.
Top job : research scientist.
Approximately four years ago, we initiated a dual ladder of advancement for technical persons.
The highest position is known as a research scientist.
This approach has not been entirely satisfactory.
The primary deterrent appears to lie with the technical people themselves, and their concept of what constitutes status in present-day society.
Scientists who agitate hardest for technical recognition are often the most reluctant to accept it.
We have discovered that the outward trappings such as private offices and private secretaries are extremely important ; and although we have attempted to provide these status symbols, support of the dual-ladder plan has been half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of men in top managerial positions.
A serious problem accompanying the technical-ladder approach is the difficulty of clearly defining responsibilities and standards of performance for each level.
With no set standards, there is the tendency to promote to the next highest level when the top of a salary band is reached regardless of performance.
Promotion is too often based on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit.
If no specific organization plan exists limiting the number of scientists at each salary level, the result is a department top-heavy with high-level, high-salaried personnel.
Staff engineer dept. manager we have two approaches for the technical man : the position of staff engineer, which is rated as high in salary as department manager ; and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department managers and project engineers as much as possible, thus allowing them more time for strictly technical work.
These are only halfway measures, and the answer will come when some way is found to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige.
A complete plan we have made limited application of the parallel ladder plan.
The highest rated non-supervisory engineering title is research engineer.
The salary schedule permits remuneration greater than the average paid to the first level of engineering supervision ( engineering section head ).
We also have an engineering section head -- research engineer classification which has salary possibilities equivalent to that of a research engineer.
Above this point there is no generally used parallel ladder.
We also do a number of things to build up the prestige of the engineer as a professional and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence.
These include encouragement of, and assistance to, the engineer in preparation and publication of technical papers.
We have two media for publicizing individual technical activity, a magazine widely distributed both within and without the company, and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distributed to the homes of all engineers.
Publicity is given to the award of patents to our engineers and financial support is provided for individual membership in technical societies.
A recent, and more pertinent action, has been the establishment of a technical staff reporting to the vice-president for Engineering.
This function is staffed by engineers chosen for their technical competence and who have the title, member of the technical staff.
Salaries compare favorably with those paid to the first two or three levels of management.
Additional symbols of status are granted, such as reserved parking, distinctive badge passes authorizing special privileges, and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit.
We presently are involved in inaugurating a new development center.
Operations of this nature offer the best opportunity to recognize scientific status.
All scientific staff members will have the title, research-staff member.
The salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community's acceptance of him as an authority in his scientific field.
Contrary to usual organization-position evaluations, the position to which research-staff members report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duties of the research-staff member, therefore, are not necessarily evaluated as highly.
These recent steps do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineers who have displayed technical competence.
It is doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company efforts.
Fundamental to the difficulty of creating the desired prestige is the fact that, in the business community, prestige and status are conferred in proportion to the authority that one man has over others and the extent of which he participates in the management functions.
Sixty miles north of New York City where the wooded hills of Dutchess County meet the broad sweep of the Hudson River there is a new home development called Oakwood Heights.
As a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populated county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottages in the $14,000 range.
But Oakwood Heights is unique in one particular.
Its oil for heating is metered monthly to each home from a line that starts at a central storage point.
This is a pilot operation sponsored by a new entity chartered in Delaware as the Tri-*state Pipeline Corporation, with principal offices in New York State.
Its president is Otis M. Waters, partner in the law firm of Timen & Waters, 540-*k Chrysler Bldg., New York City.
Vice-president is Louis Berkman and the secretary-treasurer is Mark Ritter.
Ritter is the builder of Oakwood Heights and president of Kahler-*craft Distributors, Inc., Newburgh, N.*y..
The idea of a central tank with lines to each house is not in itself a novelty.
Not a year goes by but what several local companies in the U.*s. and Canada, even overseas, write to Fueloil & Oil Heat to inquire if it's feasible and where it is being done.
Its editors only knew of one example to point to, a public housing development of 278 homes in New Haven described by John Schulz in the March, 1950 issue.
This has survived the years but there has been considerable concern among the tenants over the fact that the oil was not metered.
Rather the monthly total consumption was divided and charged on the basis of number of rooms and persons in the family.
Common complaints included Mrs. Murphy leaving her windows open all the time, a fresh air fan, or the family was visiting Aunt Minnie with the house shut up but they still paid the same rate for oil.
As a result of that attitude, others have been discouraged from trying central distribution.
A new low capacity meter is the key that unlocks the situation at Oakwood Heights.
Called a Slo-*flo meter it was designed for this job by Power Plus Industries of Los Angeles, a key individual being Don Nelson.
Tri-*state has acquired its exclusive distribution for the northern, principal heating states.
There's an advantage in having a firm like Tri-*state headed by a lawyer.
The earlier New Haven development was public housing, so it easily leaped over the problems met in a private venture.
These have to do with property rights, municipal official attitudes and a host of others.
In working out the practical legal conclusions President Waters was not thinking only of this pilot project, for it is planned to duplicate this program or system in other builder developments nationally.
It is always difficult, or at least time-consuming, to get approval of any kind of line under a public street, as one example.
To overcome this, the builder lays and completes the street himself, then deeds it to the community while retaining a perpetual easement for the oil lines.
When a family buys a home the title is subject to a perpetual easement to Tri-*state.
For the central storage, Tri-*state buys one acre, buries its tanks and simply holds permanent title to that piece.
In other words, the whole storage and pipeline system does not belong to the homeowners nor to the town but rather to Tri-*state.
How does Tri-*state get its revenue from this plan?
It leases the whole facility to a large oil company, at least large enough to have a strong credit position.
This first test is being leased for ten years but future projects will require at least 15 years.
The amount paid by the oil company to Tri-*state for the use of its oil distribution system and the privilege of supplying all the homes, is subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both parties.
On this first venture the central storage is 20,000 gallons, in two tanks, or an average of 400 gallons for each of the 50 homes.
The supplier delivers at his convenience in transport loads, so as to maintain two-to-three weeks reserve supply against weather contingencies.
However, that is not all he has to do.
He must undertake complete servicing of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heating.
In the present project the heating is by circulating hot water from Paragon boiler-burner units with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups.
Again, the oil man must read the meters at such intervals as he finds best.
For this first development the supplier signing the lease is a major oil company but in turn the deal is being transferred for operation to its local fueloil distributor.
The major gets the assured gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost is low.
Initial considerations the officers of the new corporation have naturally explored many angles, as well as personalities that might be affected.
For example, the officials of Poughkeepsie town ( township ) where the project is located think highly of it because it simplifies their snow clearing problem.
The central storage is near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transports on a short crescent swing, with fewer trucks in the residential streets.
The Public Service Commission has ruled that this is not a public utility, subject to their many regulations.
Several financial institutions, both banks and insurance companies, have been sounded out.
They like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term leases by strong oil companies.
The Government housing agencies consider it feasible with one special stipulation.
There must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charged more than the current market price for the oil, an obvious precaution, since the account is permanently wedded, just like with gas or electricity.
For a few details of the system the lines are 1-1/4'' X-*tru-*coat, a product of Republic Steel Corp., and all lines are welded.
They are laid a minimum of 24'' deep and in some areas four feet down, particularly under roads, to stay clear of all other piping such as water and sewers and to minimize shocks from heavy trucking.
The meter is mounted high on the basement wall.
Its figures are a half inch high and very easy to read, even into tenth gallons.
It will accommodate firing rates as low as a half gallon an hour.
Ritter, the builder, is convinced that the total cost of all the heating systems plus the oil distribution system is no greater than would be gas heating systems in the houses plus their lines and meters.
He believes that this is a sound approach to gas competition in builder developments where gas is available.
It would be pretty difficult to install a Tri-*state system in old neighborhoods, and that's an understatement.
The job of getting property easements and street easements and the acre for the tanks would become pretty discouraging.
But in a new development where everything starts from scratch the solutions are simple.
Future plans what does Tri-*state actually want to do, now that it has the meters under franchise and certain phases of its piping system in the patent applied for stage?
It wants to interest builders and oil companies in the idea of including its facility in their new home projects, by financing and installing the storage, piping and meters, and leasing these for 15 years, with renewal options, to a strong oil company.
It may also work in one other way -- by licensing its system patents and supplying the meters, letting the oil company or even the builder install the facilities.
This whole development is certain to be of interest to the readers, for the idea has so often been mentioned, somewhat wistfully.
But it's too early yet to go visit Oakwood Heights.
Only eight of the 50 houses were completed at the time of the editor's visit on June 8th ; others were building.
The big tanks were at the site but still sunning themselves.
A big mechanical ditcher was running the trenches, and the town building inspector was paying a friendly, if curious, visit.
The oilheating industry is looking up, led by a revival of research and development.
A primary ingredient in these fields is imagination, and Tri-*state Pipeline Corporation deserves a very good mark.
Every year about this time National Gargle Your Cooling System week rolls around.
It pays in the long ( hot ) run to take good care of the water works.
Do it this way for the summer gargle : first, drain that old coolant down the storm sewer.
Don't save the anti-freeze, even if it the expensive permanent type.
The word means it won't boil away easily, nothing else.
The rust inhibitors in the fluid are used up after one year, and you don't want to risk the rust that two years' use could mean.
Pitch it out.
If a lot of rust shows in the drain, use a good flushing cleaner.
Then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor.
Of course, you'll want to use the softest water you can in your radiators.
Now, check for leaks in your hoses and hose connections, around the freeze-out plugs, gaskets, water pump seals and heater fittings.
Next, run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat opens, and then look for leaks again.
Be sure the bugs and dirt are blown out of the radiator fins.
Use the air hose for this job.
Check the temperature gage and be sure it is working.
If you use one of the new year-round cooling system fluids such as Dowguard be sure to check it.
Dow says that the fluid can be used now for two years.
Check its inhibitor effectiveness before leaving it in during the summer.
Take precautions now, to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdowns when the temperature zooms this summer.
Don't let your mechanics pull the thermostats out of those fueloil delivery trucks or installation rigs of yours.
Spring and summer may be here officially, but those thermos stay in.
The fact is that removing and leaving out a thermostat from any water cooled vehicle, will greatly increase the fuel consumption, reduce power and contribute to spark plug fouling due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposits on the insulators.
If you run into excess plug fouling on one truck, check to be sure that the rig has a thermostat.
The thermostat is important to get your engine up to operating temperature quickly, and to keep it running at its most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant.
Are you paying too much for your truck insurance?
There's a good chance you are doubling on some coverage, not taking discounts coming to you and not cutting some corners that can be cut.
Have a talk with your insurance agent.
Be careful that you keep adequate coverage, but look for places to save money.
First go over the type of coverage you now have.
Look for these features which may mean you can save : duplicate coverage.
Avoid doubling up on the same item.
For example, don't pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be paying for in a health and accident policy.
Does your policy have a lay-up clause?
This means that if your insured vehicle is laid up for more than 30 days, insurance can be suspended and a proportionate return of your premium made to you.
This applies to repair work of winter storage.
The figure five is important in insurance.
With many company policies you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rigs.
This means either cars or trucks.
Discounts run up to 2% of cost.
Usually premium reductions can be obtained by applying deductibles to your liability plan.
For example : if your bodily injury claims start payment after the first $250, a 25% premium saving is often made.
In the period since the end of World War 2 -- a period coinciding with merchandising demands for the colorful, the unusual, and the original in signs and displays -- plastics have come on so strong that today they are the acknowledged leaders in the field.
The importance of the sign industry to the plastics industry, however, is not in terms of volume alone.
Designers of signs and displays have shown a refreshing approach to the adaptation of plastics that has influenced the workings of other industries.
Many of today's developments in thermoforming stem from original work done with signs and displays ; the art of preprinting in distortion was similarly perfected by the sign makers ; and the reverse-surface decorating techniques now used for escutcheons, medallions, etc., owes much to the field, as does the technology of designing with the light-transmitting properties of the transparent plastics.
There is much that many industries can continue to learn from some of the more recent developments described below.
The concept of trans-illumination ( as shown by the photo on p. 92 ), as just one example, offers an entirely new approach to lighting problems -- no matter what industry is involved.
A volume market according to a recent Wall Street Journal survey, plastics units now account for more than 50% of all sign sales.
Five years ago, they had only 10% of the market, with the remainder firmly entrenched in the stronghold of neon tubing.
And it's far from the end for plastics.
Industry sources are now estimating that 75% of the signs made during the 1960's will be of plastic construction.
Evidence of this trend can best be seen in the recent activities of such leading companies in the field as Advance Neon Sign Co., Los Angeles, Calif..
Four years ago, the company's entire line was devoted to neon signs ; today, 85% is in plastics.
From the volume standpoint, the total market represented by the sign industry is impressive.
Aggregate sales during 1960 reached approximately $500 million.
Currently, there are some 6000 companies in the field, ranging from small firms with a handful of employees to major concerns having complete facilities for production of metal, electrical, and plastic components.
Why the trend to plastics?
What accounts for the rapid growth of plastics in the sign and display field?
Out of many factors which might be cited, five are most important : 1.
Plastics combine such properties as built-in color, light weight, optional transparency or translucency, resistance to corrosion, as well as the ease of fabrication.
2.
Plastic signs are economical.
According to one major producer, materials for a typical plastic sign are approximately 25% less costly than for a comparable neon unit.
Shipping cost is also reduced ; a 3-by-6-ft. plastic sign weighs about 120 lb., compared to 275-300 lb. for neon.
The weight advantage, plus greater durability of the plastic unit, yields a saving of about one-fifth in shipping.
The lighter weight also means less costly supports and mountings are needed.
Finally, maintenance costs on plastic signs are much lower than on fragile neon signs.
3.
They offer exceptional design freedom, making it possible to incorporate contours and details which give free range to the talents of the designer.
Vacuum- and pressure-formed sheet plastics fill the gap between cardboard and molded plastics.
Pre-decoration, low-cost molds, and the freedom to form large and small, thick and thin materials make plastics tailor-made for the industry.
4.
Plastic signs work around the clock.
Internal illumination, protected from the elements, gives them powerful visual appeal at night ; during daylight hours their brilliant colors command attention and interest.
5.
Advances in equipment and fabrication techniques give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production techniques, ranging from injection molding for intricate, smaller-size, mass-production signs ( generally 5000 units is the minimum ) to vacuum and pressure forming for larger signs of limited runs.
Among the newest fabrication methods to enter the display field are expandable styrene molding and blow molding.
What plastics to use?
For outdoor signs and displays, acrylic, with its outstanding optical characteristics, weather resistance and formability, strongly dominates the picture.
At present, both the familiar cast acrylic and the newer extruded sheets are being used by sign manufacturers, with extruded now representing an estimated 10% of the total.
( see panel, p. 166, for a comparison.
) of interest is a recent announcement by Du Pont's Polychemicals Dept. of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designated as Monocite *j 100, which was developed specifically for production of cast acrylic sheets for the sign and lighting industry.
Sheeting cast from this material reportedly weighs only one-third as much as glass, is impervious to all kinds of weather, and will not yellow.
Its high impact strength, even at low temperatures, resists chipping, cracking, and crazing, according to Du Pont.
Cellulose acetate butyrate is used extensively for vacuum-formed signs, background panels, and molded or formed letters because of its exceptional toughness, ease of forming, and excellent weathering properties.
Its clarity and good optical properties are other important factors.
New to the field is a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheets of the laminate are of different color.
Thermoforming the laminate and then sanding away the top layer is a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign.
( see *j, Mar. 1961, p. 98 ).
For specialized types of displays, such as large three-dimensional units reproducing a product, package, human or animal figures, etc., reinforced plastics and rotationally molded vinyl plastisols are other materials frequently used.
A relative newcomer in outdoor signs is Mylar polyester film, now used as a printed overlay for trans-illuminated signs ( see below ).
For outdoor signs and displays, where the problem of weathering resistance is no longer a factor, the choice of plastics is almost unlimited.
Here may be found regular and impact styrene, cellulose acetate, cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate, acrylic, vinyl, expandable styrene foam, and polyethylene.
The final choice of material depends upon such factors as costs, method of fabrication, degree of complexity, number of units required, time available for tooling, and projected life expectancy of the unit.
Often, the finished sign or display incorporates several types of plastics and two or more fabricating techniques.
Trans-illuminated billboards one of the most significant advancements in design of plastics signs is the so-called trans-illuminated billboard, now being produced by several large sign manufacturers such as Advance Neon Sign Co., Los Angeles, and Industrial Electric Inc., New Orleans, La..
The essential difference between the new trans-illuminated boards and existing billboards is that the former, constructed of translucent plastic panels, are lighted from within.
With the source of light behind the copy, there is no loss of lumen output, as with conventional boards illuminated by means of reflected light.
Also, the light sources are shielded from dirt and weather exposure and cannot obstruct the view of the sign.
The copy itself, including any text or illustrations, is reproduced in full color directly on a thin Mylar polyester film by a photo screen process.
The film has an adhesive on the back which permits it to be stripped onto the acrylic panels forming the sign, and also to be stripped off for replacement by new copy as required.
Spare sets of face panels simplify the change from one copy or message to another ; new panels are exchanged for the old right in the field on a single trip.
Panels with outdated copy are returned to the sign shop so a new message can be applied.
Signs of this type have already made their appearance in several larger cities, and others are on the way.
It is believed that these boards will, within the next few years, replace many of the conventional flood-lighted boards now in use.
Trans-illuminated signs also show versatility in other directions.
As used by Industrial Electric Inc., the film panels are printed one at a time, as are 24-sheet posters.
Thus the film can be applied to back-lighted translucent plastics faces ; they can also be applied to opaque panels for use on cutouts, or they can be applied directly to painted bulletin faces.
In this way, the sign maker has an economical means for displaying uniform copy on different sign media.
Recently Industrial Electric unveiled another new development made possible by modern plastic materials -- a revolving spectacular sign.
Comprised of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic sections, it makes it possible to combine three different signs in a single unit.
The triangles automatically revolve in a cycle which permits 9 sec. of viewing time for each poster subject.
Sixteen panels, each slightly more than 1-1/2 ft. wide, make up the 25-ft. length of the sign.
Changeable letters fill many needs perhaps the best way to indicate the versatility of design that characterizes the use of plastics in signs and displays would be to look at what is happening in only one of the areas in this complex field -- changeable signs.
Signs are meant to convey a message, and in most cases, this requires words and letters.
Frequently, the message must be changed at intervals to feature new products, price changes, etc..
The huge market for changeable signs has spurred a universal demand for individual plastic letters, in all shapes and sizes -- and a number of companies are set up to supply them.
Here are some of the newer items currently available : Poster Products Inc., Chicago, Ill. : a changeable copy and display sign which consists of an extruded impact styrene background in choice of colors, onto which are mounted snap-in letters, figures, or words screened on acetate or other types of sheet stock.
The background, which is available in various widths and continuous lengths, is extruded with parallel undercut grooves which grip the flexible letters securely.
The Adaptaplex Co., Beaverton, Ore. : letters molded of butyrate, available in several sizes in either red or black.
Ideal for merchandising use, they are weather-resistant, and have mounting pegs on the back which fit into openings in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel.
For large letters, e.g. thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate, there are other techniques.
For example, in a typical store installation, fifty 24-in. and six 36-in. red acrylic letters were mounted against a white painted wood background.
The fact that even the larger letters weighed only 5 lb. each made it possible to secure the letters to the building through clear acrylic angle brackets cemented to the letters.
Stainless steel screws were used to minimize corrosion stains.
For mounting to corrugated plastic backgrounds, very small holes may be drilled in the sides of the letters and stainless steel wire threaded through the openings, its ends twisted behind the panels.
Large injection-molded letters are also available for sign installations.
Wagner Sign Service Inc., Chicago, for example, supplies them in several colors, in heights of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 17 inches.
They are molded of a special weather-resistant formulation of Tenite butyrate.
Also available from this company are Snug-*grip Plasti-*bars, extruded of transparent acrylic material, which may be cemented to any corrugated acrylic background material.
Made in lengths from 3 to 10 ft., the bars are shaped in cross section to provide a secure fit for the tapered slots molded in back of the letters.
Still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign is a modular unit introduced by Merritt Products, Azusa, Calif..
This vacuum formed sign is comprised of 27-in. ( or smaller ) panels formed of 0.080-in. clear butyrate sheet stock, masked and sprayed on the rear side.
Finished signs are produced by sliding the separate letter panels into channels of 0.025-in. aluminum, which may be mounted to various surfaces.
The sheets are extruded of Tenite butyrate by Jet Specialties Co., Los Angeles, Calif..
On large-area units, where additional structural requirements are imposed, one recent approach utilizes modular extruded or formed channels ( e.g. right-angled corrugations ) of the acrylic or butyrate.
Joined side by side, such channels make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous areas up to 50 ft. high and of unlimited width.
Letters may be wired to the face of the combined channels, painted on the first surface, or handled in other ways.
New rule no. 2 : don't build from the outside in -- try to build from the inside out.
Don't insert your components into fixed openings, they may or may not fit ; position your components before you close them in.
For example : don't wall in your kitchen before you hang the wall cabinets and set the appliances.
It's a lot quicker and easier to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinets and erect the end wall after they are all in place.
Set your bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom.
Don't try to wrestle a 400-lb. tub *f through a narrow doorway.
Finish your plumbing before you frame it in ( most economical framing is a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipes ).
Finish installing and connecting up your furnace and your water heater before you wall them in.
There is no better way to waste time than trying to install a furnace in a finished *f closet.
Don't position your studs before you insert your windows in conventional construction ; that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you paid for the window.
You can save all that shimming time if you set your windows in one, two, three order -- first the stud on one side, then the window, then the stud on the other side.
Install your disappearing stair ( or stairs ) to the attic and finish your overhead ducts before you drywall the ceiling.
Don't close in your house until everything has been carried in.
Last wall Bob Schmitt erects is the wall between the house and garage.
That way he can truck his parts right indoors and unload them under the roof.
No auto maker would dream of putting the head on the engine before he fitted the pistons in the block.
And trailer makers, those most industrialized and therefore most efficient of homebuilders, say they save hundreds of dollars by always building from the inside out.
New rule no. 3 : rethink everything to get all the big savings the revolution in materials handling offers you.
This revolution is the biggest build-better-for-less news of all, because : 1.
It makes it easy to handle much heavier units, so you can plan to build with much bigger and heavier prefabricated components like those shown in the pictures alongside.
2.
It makes materials handling the only construction cost that ( like earthmoving and roadbuilding ) should be lower today than in 1929.
3.
It changes the answers to who should do what, and where?
It lessens the need for costly on-site fabrication and increases the chance for shop fabrication, where almost everything can be made better and cheaper.
4.
It changes the answers on when to do what at the site.
For example, instead of putting in your driveways last ( as many builders do ) you can now save money by putting them in first.
Instead of closing the house in first ( as most builders do ) you can now cut your costs by not closing it in until you have to ( see *j 121 ).
5.
It changes the answers on builder-dealer relations.
Not so long ago many builders were finding they could cut their costs by buying direct and short-cutting the dealer.
But now many of these same builders are finding they can cut their costs more by teaming up with a dealer who has volume enough to afford the most efficient specialized equipment to deliver everything just where it is needed -- drywall inside the house, siding along the sides, trusses on the walls, roofing on the roof, etc..
Says Clarence Thompson : we dealers must earn our mark-up by performing a service for the builder cheaper than he could do it himself.
The revolution now under way in materials handling makes this much easier.
The revolution is well under way, but much more remains to be done.
Five years ago a House & Home Round Table cosponsored by the Lumber Dealers' Research Council reported unhappily : only one lumber dealer in ten is equipped to handle unit loads ; only one box car in eight has the wide doors needed for unit loads ; only one producer in a hundred is equipped to package and ship unit loads ; only one builder in a thousand is equipped to receive unit loads.
So from raw materials to finished erection the costs of materials handling ( most of it inefficient ) add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of housing.
That House & Home Round Table was the real starting point for today's revolution in materials handling, says Clarence Thompson, long chairman of the Lumber Dealers' Research Council.
It made our whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer, carrier, equipment maker, dealer, and builder, all working together to cut the cost of materials handling.
Before that we lumber dealers were working almost single-handed on the problem.
Here is where things stand today : 1.
Almost all of the 3,000 lumber dealers who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90% of this year's new houses are mechanized.
There are few areas left where a builder cannot find a dealer equipped to save him money by delivering everything at lower cost just where his workmen will need it.
2.
Practically all bulky housing products can now be ordered in standard units palletized or unitized for mechanical handling -- including lumber, asphalt shingles, glass block, face brick, plaster, lime, hardboard, gypsum wallboard and sheathing, cement, insulation sheathing, floor tile, acoustical tile, plaster base, and asbestos shingles.
3.
Truck and materials-handling equipment makers now offer specialized units to meet almost every homebuilding need.
For some significant new items see the pictures.
4.
More than 50% of all lumber is unitized ; an *j survey found that at least 492 lumber mills will strap their shipments for mechanized handling.
Of these, 376 said they make no extra charge for strapping in standard units, because they save enough on mechanized carloading to offset their strapping cost.
Most of the others will swallow their $.50 to $3 charge rather than lose a good customer.
With a 15,500-lb. fork-lift, dealers can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box cars for $.30/mbf compared with $1.65 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time, says James Wright of *j.
5.
Lumber dealers and lumber manufacturers have agreed on a standard unit for unitized shipments -- 48'' wide by a nominal 30'' high ( or six Mc*cracken packets 24'' wide by nominal 7'' high ).
These units make it easy to load as much as 48,000 *j ( say 120,000 *j in a 50' box car ) much more than the average for loose-loaded cars.
6.
The railroads have responded by adding 20,000 more box cars with doors 12' or wider for forklift unloading ( a 21% increase while the total number of box cars was falling 6% ) and by cutting their freight rates twice on lumber shipped in heavily loaded cars.
First was a 1958 cut of more than 50% on that portion of the load in excess of 40,000 *j ; later came a 1961 cut on the West Coast ( still pending elsewhere ) of $.07/cwt on 70,000 *j carloads ( which works out to more than $4/mbf on that portion of the load in excess of 70,000 *j.
7.
More unitized lumber is being shipped on flat cars, and *j studies show that flat cars loaded with the new Type 6-*b floating-load method can be unloaded for as little as $.054/mbf.
For long hauls these shipments should be protected with water-proof paper.
This costs from $.75 to $2.30/mbf, but the cover can pay off if the lumber is to be stored in the open.
These carriers cut handling costs for the dealer -- and the builder.
Says *j James Wright : since 1958 carriers that move material from the yard to the job site have undergone more radical changes than any of the dealer's other equipment.
The reason : today's components and lumber packages are far too bulky to be handled by a truckdriver and a helper.
So manufacturers have pioneered a new type of vehicle -- the self-unloading carrier.
It cuts the lumber dealer's cost because it takes only one man -- the driver -- to unload it, and because it unloads in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unloading.
And it helps the builder because it can handle a more efficiently packaged load, can deliver it to the best spot ( in some cases, right on the roof or inside the house ), and never takes any of the builder's high-priced labor to help unload it.
Says Wright : our survey shows that one third of the retail dealers plan to increase the mechanization of their materials handling in the coming two years.
And most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicles.
New rule no. 4 : restudy what your men do, to help them waste less of the time you pay for.
Half the manhours you pay for on most jobs are wasted because the job was not planned right, so the right tools were not handy at the right place at the right time, or the right materials were not delivered to the handiest spots or materials were not stacked in the right order for erection, or you bought cheap materials that took too long to fit, or your workmen had to come back twice to finish a job they could have done on one trip.
Even America's most efficient builder, Bob Schmitt of Berea, hopes to cut his labor costs another $2,000 per house as a result of the time-&-motion studies now being completed on his operation by industrial efficiency engineers from the Stanley Works.
Already this study has suggested ways to cut his foundation manhours from 170 to 105 by eliminating idle time and wasted motion.
Builder Eddie Carr of Washington, past president of *j, cut his bricklaying costs $150 a house by adopting the *j masonry process worked out after careful time-&-motion studies by the Structural Clay Products Research Foundation to help bricklayers do better work for less.
A midwestern builder cut his labor costs per thousand bricks from $81 to $43.50 by adopting this same process, cut them another $7.50 to $36 by buying his bricks in convenient, easy-to-spot 100-brick packages.
The *j process, with its precision corner-posts, its precision guide lines, its working level scaffold, and its hand-level brick supply takes eight manhours to get set, but once ready it makes it easy for bricklayers to lay a thousand bricks a day.
See page 156.
One good way to cut your labor waste is to make sure you are using just the right number of men in each crew.
Reports Jim Lendrum : by studying men on the job, we found that two men -- a carpenter and a helper -- can lay a floor faster than three.
We found that three men -- two carpenters and a helper -- can put up wall panels or trusses more economically than four men -- because four men don't make two teams ; they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper team.
We found that wherever you can use two teams on a job, five men, not four, is the magic number.
No house was ever built that could not have been built better for less if the work had been better planned and the work better scheduled.
New rule no. 5 : don't waste any $.10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $.03 a stud.
This is the most penny-wise, pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit.
Green lumber was all very well back in the days of wet plaster, when the framing lumber was bound to swell and then shrink as tons of water dried out the gypsum.
But now that all production builders build with drywall and all smart builders build with panels, green lumber is an anachronism you cannot afford.
Green studs cost about $.65 ; dry studs cost less than $.03 more.
So if a green stud makes a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 seconds, the green stud becomes more expensive than a dry stud.
There comes a time in the lives of most of us when we want to be alone.
Not necessarily to be off all by ourselves, but away from the crowds and common happenstance.
If you've travelled in Europe a time or two, it is quite certain that you've had that wanting-to-be-alone feeling or that you will get it on your next visit across the Atlantic.
Following a guide, and gratefully so, is an excellent way to see all the important places when everything is strange and new.
However, after you've seen all the historical piazzas and plazas, the places and forums, the churches and museums, the palaces and castles, and begin to feel at home in the capitals of Europe, you'll want to change your course and follow the by-roads at will, far from the market places.
The champagne at Troyes, the traditional capital of the champagne country, has more ambrosial taste somehow than it has at a sidewalk cafe on the Rue de la Paix or at Tour D'*argent.
You can relive history and follow, in fancy, the Crusaders in their quest for the Holy Grail as they sail out from Brindisi, an ancient town in the heel of Italy's boot.
And you don't meet the folks from home in Northwest Spain which has remained almost untouched by time and tourists since the Middle Ages.
Time stands still as you climb the narrow, stone stairways in tiny villages clinging to steep mountain slopes or wander through story-book towns, perched atop lofty crags, their faces turned to the sea.
They've been there since the days of the Moors and the Saracens.
And what better way to end a day than by dining with artists and gourmets in a squat but charming fisherman's village on the Mediterranean?
An almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventures is just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road.
For those who need or want and can afford another car, buying one and driving it on the grand tour, then shipping it home, is one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage.
Then, of course, there are those of us who either do not want or need or cannot afford another car.
The answer to this diathesis is to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one.
It is that elemental.
Almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you.
You can call one of the car rental services directly ( Hertz, Avis, Auto-*europe Nationalcar Rental, and others ) and ask them to reserve a car of your choice, and some transportation lines offer this service as well.
With few exceptions, your car will be waiting for you at dockside, airport, railroad station or hotel when you arrive, oftentimes at no additional cost.
You can wait, of course, until you arrive in Europe before renting your car.
The disadvantages to this method are that you may not have as great a choice of models readily available or you may have to wait a few days or, during the busy tourist season, when cars are in great demand, you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all.
Since charges are relatively the same, reserving a car before you leave for Europe will assure you of having one on tap when you want it.
For those who plan to travel to Europe by one route and return by another some agencies offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city, or even another country, when you are ready to return home.
At some cities, this pick-up and delivery service is without additional charge, and, if you are budget-wise, when you are planning your itinerary, you will take advantage of these free delivery and collection stations in major cities within the larger European countries.
International Touring Documents are usually provided with the car as are road maps and touring data.
A valid American driving license is accepted in all countries except Portugal, Spain, Yugoslavia and Eastern Europe.
If you plan to visit any of these countries, you can obtain your International Driving Permit before you leave at a nominal fee -- around $3.00.
Your insurance, too, with most agencies, is provided with the car, covering comprehensive fire, theft, liability and collision with a deductible clause which varies in different countries.
If you would feel happier with full collision insurance, there is a small additional charge, again varying from country to country and depending on the term of such insurance.
The average charge for this additional insurance coverage is roughly $1.00 a day.
The charge is variable, however, and goes as low as $.50 a day in Ireland and as high as $2.00 a day in Greece.
Rental fees are variable, too, throughout the countries of Europe.
There are as many rates as there are countries and models of cars available.
As in the United States, there is a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cents per kilometer driven, and the per-day rate drops if the car is retained for a week.
It drops again after fifteen and/or twenty-one days.
It is well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $.80 to $.90 for the equivalent of a United States gallon and while you might prefer a familiar Ford, Chevrolet or even a Cadillac, which are available in some countries, it is probably wiser to choose the smaller European makes which average thirty, thirty-five and even forty miles to the gallon.
Your choice of model will undoubtedly be governed by the number of people travelling in your group.
With the exception of the sports cars, even the quite tiny sedans will seat four passengers if you are willing to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation.
There is a large variety of models to choose from in most countries, however, including 6-passenger sedans and station wagons and the rental fee isn't all that much greater than for the wee sedans.
The basic costs are generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve your car, but some of them offer supplementary advantages.
There is the free intra-city rent it here, leave it there service, as an example, the free delivery and collection at the airport, dockside or your hotel, luggage racks, touring documents and information and other similar services.
A little investigation by telephone or reading the travel ads in the newspapers and magazines will give you these pertinent details on the additional money-saving benefits.
The investigation will be well worth your time.
All model cars are not available in all countries.
Quite naturally, there is a greater availability of those models which are manufactured within a specific country.
If you would like to start your tour in Italy, where the rental fees are actually the lowest in Europe, Fiats in all sizes are available, as are Alfa Romeo Giulietta models.
If you wish to budget closely on transportation, saving your extra dollars to indulge in luxuries, one agency lists the small Fiat 500 at only $1.26 a day plus $.03 a kilometer and the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon, seating six, at just $1.10 a day and $.105 a kilometer.
If you will be using your car more than fifteen days, which isn't all unlikely, the daily rates drop quite sharply to $.86 a day for the Fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $.30 a day for the Fiat 2100 Station Wagon.
With six in the group, the cost comes to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee.
In the majority of countries, however, the rates range from $3.00 to $3.50 a day for the smaller sedans and graduate up to $7.00 and $8.00 a day for the larger, luxury European models, with the rate per kilometer driven starting at $.03 and going up as high as $.12.
The same model car might be available in six or eight countries, yet not two countries will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer driven.
The variations are not too great.
Rates for American cars are somewhat higher, ranging from about $8.00 a day up to $14.00 a day for a Chevrolet Convertible, but the rate per kilometer driven is roughly the same as for the larger European models.
Rates in Greece and Finland are fairly high, actually the highest in Europe, and, surprisingly enough, they are also quite high in Ireland.
If you are planning to tour Europe for longer than a month, it might be wise for you to lease a car.
The actual over-all cost, for the first month, will perhaps not be too much lower than the rental charges for the same period of time, but you will receive a new car.
You will be entitled to all the advantages of a new car owner, which includes the factory guarantee and the services valid at authorized dealers throughout Europe.
Further, there is no mileage charge or mileage limitations when you lease a car, and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for documents and insurance since the car is registered and insured individually for your trip.
There is a fairly wide selection of models of English, German and French manufacture from which you can choose from the very small Austin 7, Citroen 2 *j, Volkswagens, Renaults to the 6-passenger Simca Beaulieu.
Leasing a car is not as common or as popular as renting a car in Europe, but for long periods it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory.
After the first month, rates are considerably less, averaging only about $60 a month for most 4- and 5-passenger models.
There are reasons for some people not wanting to rent cars and going on the do-it-yourself plan.
For one thing, the driver usually sees less and has less fun than his passengers since it becomes pretty necessary for him to keep at least one eye on the road.
Then, too, European drivers have reputations for being somewhat crazy on the road and some Americans are not particularly keen on getting mixed up with them.
Still there is a way for those who want to see some of the back country of Europe by car.
The way is to rent a chauffeur-driven car.
It isn't as expensive as most people believe it to be.
Your chauffeur's expenses will average between $7.00 to $12.00 a day, but this charge is the same whether you rent a 7-passenger Cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger Peugeot or Fiat 1800.
The big spread is in the charge for each kilometer driven, being governed by the rate at which gasoline is consumed.
Since most European cars average more miles per gallon of gasoline than American cars, it naturally follows that the cost per kilometer for these models will be less, but the greater seating capacity of the large American cars will equalize this, provided your group is sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine.
The fees for the rental of chauffeur-driven cars vary in the different countries in the same manner as they do for the drive-yourself cars.
However, whether you arrange to have a European or American model, if you rent a car with the proper seating capacity in relation to the number of people in your party, your transportation expense will average very close to $10.00 per day per passenger.
This will include your helpful, English-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometers in any one day.
If you drive greater distances than that, you'll just be skimming the surface and will never discover the enchantment, fascination and beauty which lured you in the first place to explore the hinterlands.
Of course, if you want to throw all caution to the winds and rent an Imperial or Cadillac limousine just for you and your bride, you'll have a memorable tour, but it won't be cheap, and it is not recommended unless you own a producing oil well or you've had a winner in the Irish Sweepstakes.
In American romance, almost nothing rates higher than what the movie men have called meeting cute -- that is, boy-meets-girl seems more adorable if it doesn't take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom.
Just about the most enthralling real-life example of meeting cute is the Charles Mac*arthur-*helen Hayes saga : reputedly all he did was give her a handful of peanuts, but he said simultaneously, I wish they were emeralds.
Aside from the comico-romantico content here, a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other facts, especially if he had a little more of the conversation to go on.
The way Mac*arthur said his line -- if you had the recorded transcript of a professional linguist -- would probably have gone like this : *f primary stresses on emeralds and wish ; note pitch 3 ( pretty high ) on emeralds but with a slight degree of drawl, one degree of oversoftness.
Conclusions : the people involved ( and subsequent facts bear me out here ) knew clearly the relative values of peanuts and emeralds, both monetary and sentimental.
And the drawling, oversoft voice of flirtation, though fairly overt, was still well within the prescribed gambit of their culture.
In other words, like automation machines designed to work in tandem, they shared the same programming, a mutual understanding not only of English words, but of the four stresses, pitches, and junctures that can change their meaning from black to white.
At this point, unfortunately, romance becomes a regrettably small part of the picture ; but consider, if you can bear it, what might have happened if Mac*arthur, for some perverse, undaunted reason, had made the same remark to an Eskimo girl in Eskimo.
To her peanuts and emeralds would have been just so much blubber.
The point -- quite simply -- is this : words they might have had ; but communication, no.
This basic principle, the first in a richly knotted bundle, was conveyed to me by Dr. Henry Lee Smith, Jr., at the University of Buffalo, where he heads the world's first department of anthropology and linguistics.
A brisk, amusing man, apparently constructed on an ingenious system of spring-joints attuned to the same peppery rhythm as his mind, Smith began his academic career teaching speech to Barnard girls -- a project considerably enlivened by his devotion to a recording about a young rat named Arthur, who never could make up his mind.
Later, he became one of the central spirits of the Army Language Program and the language school of Washington's Foreign Service Institute.
It was there, in the course of trying to prepare new men for the culture shock they might encounter in remote overseas posts, that he first began to develop a system of charting the norms of human communication.
To the trained ear of the linguist, talk has always revealed a staggering quantity of information about the talker -- such things as geographical origin and/or history, socio-economic identity, education.
It is only fairly recently, however, that linguists have developed a systematic way of charting voices on paper in a way that tells even more about the speakers and about the success or failure of human communication between two people.
This, for obvious reasons, makes their techniques superbly useful in studying the psychiatric interview, so useful, in fact, that they have been successfully used to suggest ways to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy.
In the early 1950's, Smith, together with his distinguished colleague, George Trager ( so austerely academic he sometimes fights his own evident charm ), and a third man with the engaging name of Birdwhistell ( Ray ), agreed on some basic premises about the three-part process that makes communication : ( 1 ) words or language ( 2 ) paralanguage, a set of phenomena including laughing, weeping, voice breaks, and tone of voice, and ( 3 ) kinesics, the technical name for gestures, facial expressions, and body shifts -- nodding or shaking the head, talking with one's hands, et cetera.
Smith's first workout with stresses, pitches, and junctures was based on mother, which spells, in our culture, a good deal more than bread alone.
For example, if you are a reasonably well-adjusted person, there are certain ways that are reasonable and appropriate for addressing your mother.
The usual U.*s. norm would be : *f middle pitches, slight pause ( juncture ) before mother, slight rise at the end.
The symbols of mother's status, here, are all usual for culture U.*s.*a..
Quite other feelings are evidenced by this style : *f note the drop to pitch 1 ( the lowest ) on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence ; this is a fade ending, and what you have here is a downtalking style of speech, expressing something less than conventional respect for mother.
Even less regard for mom and mom's apple pie goes with : *f in other words, the way the speaker relates to mother is clearly indicated.
And while the meaning of the words is not in this instance altered, the quality of communication in both the second and third examples is definitely impaired.
An accompanying record of paralanguage factors for the second example might also note a throaty rasp.
With this seven-word sentence -- though the speaker undoubtedly thought he was dealing only with the subject of food -- he was telling things about himself and, in the last two examples, revealing that he had departed from the customs of his culture.
The joint investigations of linguistics and psychiatry have established, in point of fact, that no matter what the subject of conversation is or what words are involved, it is impossible for people to talk at all without telling over and over again what sort of people they are and how they relate to the rest of the world.
Since interviewing is the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry, the recording of interviews for playbacks and study has been a boost of Redstone proportions in new research and training.
Some of the earliest recordings, made in the 1940's demonstrated that psychiatrists reacted immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track, whereas written records of the same interview offered far fewer cues to therapy which -- if they were at all discernible in print -- were picked up only by the most skilled and sensitive experts.
In a general way, psychiatrists were able to establish on a wide basis what many of them had always felt -- that the most telling cues in psychotherapy are acoustic, that such things as stress and nagging are transmitted by sound alone and not necessarily by words.
At a minimum, recording -- usually on tape, which is now in wide professional use -- brings the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and meaning can be explored repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapists.
Newest to this high-powered battery are the experts in linguistics who have carried that minimum to a new level.
By adding a systematic analysis with symbols to the typed transcripts of interviews, they have supplied a new set of techniques for the therapist.
Linguistic charting of the transcribed interview flags points where the patient's voice departs from expected norms.
It flags such possible breakdowns of communication as rehearsed dialogue, the note of disapproval, ambivalence or ambiguity, annoyance, resentment, and the disinclination to speak at all -- this last often marked by a fade-in beginning of sentences.
Interpretation, naturally, remains the role of the therapist, but orientation -- not only the patient's vocal giveaways of geographical and socio-economic background, but also vocal but non-verbal giveaways of danger spots in his relationship to people -- can be considerably beefed up by the linguist.
His esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to areas where deeper probing may bring to light underlying psychological difficulties, making them apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient.
In one now-historic first interview, for example, the transcript ( reproduced from the book, the First Five Minutes ) goes like this : the therapist's level tone is bland and neutral -- he has, for example, avoided stressing you, which would imply disapproval ; or surprise, which would set the patient apart from other people.
The patient, on the other hand, is far from neutral ; aside from her specifically regional accent, she reveals by the use of the triad, irritable, tense, depressed, a certain pedantic itemization that indicates she has some familiarity with literary or scientific language ( i.e., she must have had at least a high-school education ), and she is telling a story she has mentally rehearsed some time before.
Then she catapults into everything and everybody, putting particular violence on everybody, indicating to the linguist that this is a spot to flag -- that is, it is not congruent to the patient's general style of speech up to this point.
Consequently, it is referred to the therapist for attention.
He may then very well conclude that everybody is probably not the true target of her resentment.
Immediately thereafter, the patient fractures her rehearsed story, veering into an oversoft, breathy, sloppily articulated, I don't feel like talking right now.
Within the first five minutes of this interview it is apparent to the therapist that everybody truthfully refers to the woman's husband.
She says later, but still within the opening five minutes, I keep thinking of a divorce but that's another emotional death.
The linguistic and paralinguistic signals of misery are all present in the voice chart for this sentence ; so are certain signals that she does not accept divorce.
By saying another emotional death, she reveals that there has been a previous one, although she has not described it in words.
This the therapist may pursue in later questioning.
The phrase, emotional death, interesting and, to a non-scientific mind, rather touching, suggests that this woman may have some flair for words, perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably called creative.
Since the psychiatric interview, like any other interview, depends on communication, it is significant to note that the therapist in this interview was a man of marked skill and long experience.
His own communication apparatus operated superbly, and Lillian Ross readers will note instantly its total lack of resemblance to the blunted, monumentally unmeshed mechanism of Dr. Blauberman.
Interestingly enough -- although none of the real-life therapists involved could conceivably compare with Blauberman -- when groups of them began playing back interviews, they discovered any number of ways in which they wanted to polish their own interview techniques ; almost everyone, on first hearing one of his own sessions on tape, expressed some desire to take the whole thing over again.
Yet, in spite of this, intensive study of the taped interviews by teams of psychotherapists and linguists laid bare the surprising fact that, in the first five minutes of an initial interview, the patient often reveals as many as a dozen times just what's wrong with him ; to spot these giveaways the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen.
Naturally, the patient does not say, I hate my father, or Sibling rivalry is what bugs me.
What he does do is give himself away by communicating information over and above the words involved.
Some of the classic indicators, as described by Drs. Pittenger, Hockett, and Danehy in the First Five Minutes, are these : ambiguity of pronouns : stammering or repetition of I, you, he, she, et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty.
On the other hand significant facts may be concealed -- she may mean I or everybody, as it did with the tense and irritable woman mentioned before, may refer to a specific person.
The word that is not used can be as important as the word that is used ; therapist and/or linguist must always consider the alternatives.
When someone says, for example, they took x-rays to see that there was nothing wrong with me, it pays to consider how this statement would normally be made.
( this patient, in actuality, was a neurasthenic who had almost come to the point of accepting the fact that it was not her soma but her psyche that was the cause of her difficulty.
) amateur linguists note here that Pursewarden, in Durrell's Alexandria Quartet, stammered when he spoke of his wife, which is hardly surprising in view of their disastrous relationship.
She was just another freighter from the States, and she seemed as commonplace as her name.
She was the John Harvey, one of those Atlantic sea-horses that had sailed to Bari to bring beans, bombs, and bullets to the U.*s. Fifteenth Air Force, to Field Marshal Montgomery's Eighth Army then racing up the calf of the boot of Italy in that early December of 1943.
The John Harvey arrived in Bari, a port on the Adriatic, on November 28th, making for Porto Nuovo, which, as the name indicates, was the ancient city's new and modern harbor.
Hardly anyone ashore marked her as she anchored stern-to off Berth 29 on the mole.
If anyone thought of the John Harvey, it was to observe that she was straddled by a pair of ships heavily laden with high explosive and if they were hit the John Harvey would likely be blown up with her own ammo and whatever else it was that she carried.
Which was poison gas.
It had required the approval of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt before the John Harvey could be loaded with 100 tons of mustard gas and despatched to the Italian warfront.
For in a world as yet unacquainted with the horrors of the mushroom cloud, poison gas was still regarded as the ultimate in hideous weapons.
Throughout the early years of World War 2, reports persisted that the Axis powers had used gas -- Germany in Russia, Japan in China again.
They were always denied.
Influential people in America were warning the Pentagon to be prepared against desperation gas attacks by the Germans in future campaigns.
Some extremists went so far as to urge our using it first.
To silence extremists, to warn the Axis, President Roosevelt issued this statement for the Allies in August : from time to time since the present war began there have been reports that one or more of the Axis powers were seriously contemplating use of poisonous gas or noxious gases or other inhumane devices of warfare.
I have been loath to believe that any nation, even our present enemies, could or would be willing to loose upon mankind such terrible and inhumane weapons.
However, evidence that the Axis powers are making significant preparations indicative of such an intention is being reported with increasing frequency from a variety of sources.
Use of such weapons has been outlawed by the general opinion of civilized mankind.
This country has not used them, and I hope that we never will be compelled to use them.
I state categorically that we shall under no circumstances resort to the use of such weapons unless they are first used by our enemies.
The following month the invasion of Italy was begun, and Roosevelt gave effect to his warning by consenting to the stockpiling of poison gas in southern Italy.
Bari was chosen as a depot, not only for its seeming safety, but because of its proximity to airfields.
Any retaliatory gas attack would be airborne.
It would be made in three waves -- the first to lay down a smokescreen, the second to drop the gas bombs, the third to shower incendiaries which would burn everything below.
So the vile cargo went into the hole of the John Harvey.
A detachment of six men from the 701st Chemical Maintenance Company under First Lt. Howard D. Beckstrom went aboard, followed by Lt. Thomas H. Richardson, the Cargo Security Officer.
Secrecy was paramount.
Only a few other people -- very important people -- knew of the nitrogen-mustard eggs nestled below decks.
No one else must know.
Thus, in the immemorial way -- in the way of the right hand that knows and the left that does not -- was the stage set for tragedy at Bari.
It was the night of December 2, 1943, and it was growing dark in Bari.
It was getting on toward 7 o'clock and the German *j plane had been and gone on its eighth straight visit.
Capt. A. B. Jenks of the Office of Harbor Defense was very worried.
He knew that German long-range bombers had been returning to the attack in Italy.
On November 24th, they had made a raid on La Maddalena.
Two days later, some 30 of them had struck at a convoy off Bougie, sinking a troopship -- and it had been that very night that the *j had made its first appearance.
After it had reappeared the next two nights, Jenks went to higher headquarters and said : for three days now a German reconnaissance plane has been over the city taking pictures.
They're just waiting for the proper time to come over here and dump this place into the Adriatic.
But the older and wiser heads had dismissed his warning as alarmist.
Even though it was known that the Luftwaffe in the north was now being directed by the young and energetic General Peltz, the commander who would conduct the Little Blitz on London in 1944, a major raid on Bari at this juncture of the war was not to be considered seriously.
True, there had been raids on Naples -- but Naples was pretty far north on the opposite coast.
No, Bari was out of range.
More than that, Allied air had complete superiority in the Eighth Army's sector.
So Captain Jenks returned to his harbor post to watch the scouting plane put in five more appearances, and to feel the certainty of this dread rising within him.
For Jenks knew that Bari's defenses were made of paper.
The Royal Air Force had but a single light anti-aircraft squadron and two balloon units available.
There were no R.*a.*f. fighter squadrons on Bari airfield.
The radar station with the best location was still not serviceable.
Telephone communication was bad.
And everywhere in evidence among the few remaining defensive units was that old handmaiden of disaster -- multiple command.
It had been made shockingly evident that very morning to Ensign Kay K. Vesole, in charge of the armed guard aboard the John Bascom.
A British officer had come aboard and told him that in case of enemy air attack he was not to open fire until bombs were actually dropped.
Then he was to co-ordinate his fire with a radar-controlled shore gun firing white tracers.
This harbor is a bomber's paradise, the Britisher had said with frank grimness.
It's up to you to protect yourselves.
We can't expect any help from the fighters at Foggia, either.
They're all being used on offensive missions.
Vesole had been stunned.
Not fire until the bombs came down ] he thought of the tons and tons of flammable fluid beneath his feet and shook his head.
Like hell ] like hell he'd wait -- and supposing the radar-controlled gun got knocked out?
What would his guns guide on then -- the North Star?
Ensign Vesole decided that he would not tarry until he heard the whispering of the bombs, and when night began to fall, he put Seaman 2/c Donald L. Norton and Seaman 1/c William A. Rochford on the guns and told them to start shooting the moment they saw an enemy silhouette.
Below decks, Seaman 1/c Stanley Bishop had begun to write a letter home.
Above decks on the John Harvey, Lieutenant Richardson gazed at the lights still burning on the port wall and felt uneasy.
There were lights glinting in the city, too, even though it was now dark enough for a few stars to become visible.
Bari was asking for it, he thought.
For five days now, they had been in port and that filthy stuff was still in the hold.
Richardson wondered when it would be unloaded.
He hoped they would put in somewhere way, way down in the earth.
The burden of his secret was pressing down on him, as it was on Lieutenant Beckstrom and his six enlisted men.
Lieutenant Richardson could envy the officers and men of the John Harvey in their innocent assumption that the ship contained nothing more dangerous than high explosive bombs.
They seemed happy at the delay in unloading, glad at the chance to go ashore in a lively liberty port such as Bari.
Nine of them had gone down the gangplank already.
Deck Cadet James L. Cahill and Seaman Walter Brooks had been the first to leave.
Richardson had returned their departing grins with the noncommittal nod that is the security officer's stock in trade.
The other half of the crew, plus Beckstrom and his men, had remained aboard.
Richardson glanced to sea and started slightly.
Damned if that wasn't a sailing ship standing out of the old harbor -- Porto Vecchio.
The night was so clear that Richardson had no difficulty making out the silhouette.
Then the thought of a cloudless sky made him shiver, and he glanced upward.
His eyes boggled.
It was a clear night and it was raining ] Capt. Michael A. Musmanno, Military governor of the Sorrentine Peninsula, had also seen and felt the rain.
But he had mistaken it for bugs.
Captain Musmanno's renovated schooner with the flamboyant name Unsinkable had just left Porto Vecchio with a cargo of badly-needed olive oil for the Sorrentine's civilian population.
Musmanno was on deck.
At exactly 7:30, he felt a fluttering object brush his face.
He snatched at it savagely.
He turned the beam of his flashlight on it.
He laughed.
It was the silver foil from the chocolate bar he had been eating.
He frowned.
But how could --?
Another, longer strip of tinsel whipped his mouth.
It was two feet long.
It was not candy wrapping.
It was window -- the tinsel paper dropped by bombers to jam radar sets, to fill the scope with hundreds of blips that would seem to be approaching bombers.
Fermate ] Musmanno bellowed to his Italian crewmen.
Stop ] stop the engines ] Unsinkable slowed and stopped, hundreds of brilliant white flares swayed eerily down from the black, the air raid sirens ashore rose in a keening shriek, the anti-aircraft guns coughed and chattered -- and above it all motors roared and the bombs came whispering and wailing and crashing down among the ships at anchor at Bari.
They had come from airports in the Balkans, these hundred-odd Junkers 88's.
They had winged over the Adriatic, they had taken Bari by complete surprise and now they were battering her, attacking with deadly skill.
They had ruined the radar warning system with their window, they had made themselves invisible above their flares.
And they also had the lights of the city, the port wall lanterns, and a shore crane's spotlight to guide on.
After the first two were blacked out, the third light was abandoned by a terrified Italian crew, who left their light to shine for nine minutes like an unerring homing beacon until British *j shot it out.
In that interval, the German bombers made a hell of Bari harbor.
Merchant ships illuminated in the light of the flares, made to seem like stones imbedded in a lake of polished mud, were impossible to miss.
The little Unsinkable sank almost immediately.
Captain Musmanno roared at his men to lash three of the casks of olive oil together for a raft.
They got it over the side and clambered aboard only a few minutes before their schooner went under.
John Bascom went down early, too.
Ensign Vesole and his gunners had fought valiantly, but they had no targets.
Most of the Junkers were above the blinding light of the flares, and the radar-controlled shore gun had been knocked out by one of the first sticks of bombs.
Vesole rushed from gun to gun, attempting to direct fire.
He was wounded, but fought on.
Norton and Rochford fired wildly at the sounds of the motors.
Bishop rushed on deck to grab a 20-mm gun, pumping out 400 rounds before sticks of three bombs each crashed into Holds One, Three and Five.
Now the Bascom was mortally wounded.
Luckily, she was not completely aflame and would go down before the gasoline could erupt.
The order to abandon ship was given, but cries of pain could be heard from the wounded below decks.
There is a pause in the merriment as your friends gaze at you, wondering why you are staring, open-mouthed in amazement.
You explain, I have the strangest feeling of having lived through this very same event before.
I can't tell when, but I'm positive I witnessed this same scene of this particular gathering at some time in the past ] this experience will have happened to many of you.
Emerson, in his lecture, refers to the startling experience which almost every person confesses in daylight, that particular passages of conversation and action have occurred to him in the same order before, whether dreaming or waking, a suspicion that they have been with precisely these persons in precisely this room, and heard precisely this dialogue, at some former hour, they know not when.
Most psychiatrists dismiss these instances of that weird feeling as the deja vue ( already seen ) illusion, just as they dismiss dream previsions as coincidences.
In this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the greater depths of mystery in which all of us grope continually.
When a man recognizes a certain experience as the exact pattern of a previous dream, we have an instance of deja vue, except for the fact that he knows just why the experience seems familiar.
Occasionally there are examples of pre-vision which cannot be pushed aside without confessing an unscientific attitude.
One day Maeterlinck, coming with a friend upon an event which he recognized as the exact pattern of a previous dream, detailed the ensuing occurrences in advance so accurately that his companion was completely mystified.
Rudyard Kipling's scorn for the jargon of psychical research was altered somewhat when he wondered how, or why, had I been shown an unreleased roll of my life film?
The famous author tells us of the strange incident in Something About Myself.
One day when he attended a war memorial ceremony in Westminster Abbey his view was obstructed by a stout man on his left, his attention turned to the irregular pattern of the rough slab flooring and someone, clasping him by the arm, whispered, I want a word with you, please.
At that moment Kipling was overwhelmed with awed amazement, suddenly recalling that these identical details of scene, action and word had occurred to him in a dream six weeks earlier.
Freud probably contributed more than anyone else to the understanding of dreams, enabling us to recognize their equivalents in our wakeful thoughts.
However, readers who accept Freud's findings and believe that he has solved completely the mystery of dreams, should ponder over the following words in his Interpretation Of Dreams, Chapter 1 : as a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream has ever been accomplished in any case, and what is more, every one attempting such solution has found that in most cases there have remained a great many components of the dream the source of which he has been unable to explain nor is the discussion closed on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dreams.
Dreams present many mysteries of telepathy, clairvoyance, prevision and retrovision.
The basic mystery of dreams, which embraces all the others and challenges us from even the most common typical dream, is in the fact that they are original, visual continuities.
I recall the startling, vivid realism of a dream in which I lived through the horror of the bombing of a little Korean town.
I am sure that nothing within me is capable of composing that life-like sequence, so complete in detail, from the hodge-podge of news pictures I have seen.
And when psychology explains glibly, but the subconscious mind is able to produce it it refers to a mental region so vaguely identified that it may embrace the entire universal mind as conceivably as part of the individual mind.
Skeptics may deny the more startling phenomena of dreams as things they have never personally observed, but failure to wonder at their basic mystery is outright avoidance of routine evidence.
The question becomes, what is a dream?
Is a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie?
Every dream, and this is true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpreted into its equivalent of wakeful thought, is a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation is available.
In most cases we recognize certain words, persons, animals or objects.
But these are dreamed in original action, in some particular continuity which we don't remember having seen in real life.
For instance, the dreamer sees himself seated behind neighbor Smith and, with photographic realism, sees Smith driving the car ; whereas, it is a matter of fact that Smith cannot drive a car.
There is nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impressions to fit into an original, realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dreams.
The entire concept of cerebral imagery as the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support.
A mental image subconsciously impressing us from beneath its language symbols in wakeful thought, or consciously in light sleep, is actually not an image at all but is comprised of realities, viewed not in the concurrent sensory stream, but within the depths of the fourth dimension.
Dreams that display events of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explaining their basic mystery and all its components, including that weird feeling of deja vue, inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem.
As in the theory of perception, established in psycho-physiology, the eye is recognized as an integral part of the brain.
But then this theory confesses that it is completely at a loss as to how the image can possibly be received by the brain.
The opening paragraph of the chapter titled the Theory Of Representative Perception, in the book Philosophies Of Science by Albert G. Ramsperger says, passed on to the brain, and there, by some unexplained process, it causes the mind to have a perception.
But why is it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain?
As retinal images are conceded to be an integral function of the brain it seems logical to suppose that the nerves, between the inner brain and the eyes, carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain centers -- rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which is already in required location.
Hereby, the external object viewed by the eyes remains the thing that is seen, not the retinal image, the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stirring sympathetic impulses in the other sensory centers, motor tensions, associated word symbols, and consciousness.
Modern physics has developed the theory that all matter consists of minute waves of energy.
We know that the number of radio and television impulses, sound waves, ultra-violet rays, etc., that may occupy the very same space, each solitary upon its own frequency, is infinite.
So we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal, apparently momentary states of matter, successive one after another in consciousness, but permanent each on its own basic phase of the progressive frequencies.
This theory makes it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness.
Space in any form is completely measured by the three dimensions.
If the fourth dimension is a physical concept and not purely metaphysical, through what medium does it extend?
It is not through space nor time that the time machine most approved by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past, or the ever-existent past-fantasy future.
Three seconds flat is the usual time, and the space is crossed by moderate mileage, while the overwhelming immensity of such journeys must be conceived as a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequencies which perpetuate all events.
The body, senses and brain, in common with all matter, have their counterpart on each of a countless number of frequencies.
The senses in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomena that share its own frequency, whereas those upon all other frequencies are invisible, inaudible and intactible to them.
Consciousness is the factor that provides the progressive continuity to sensory impressions.
When consciousness deserts the sleeping body and the wakeful world, it continues in the myriad progressions of the ever-present past and future, in a life as vibrant and real as the one left when the body tired and required sleep.
If the photographically realistic continuity of dreams, however bizarre their combinations, denies that it is purely a composition of the brain, it must be compounded from views of diverse realities, although some of them may never be encountered in what we are pleased to call the real life.
Dr. H. V. Hilprecht, Professor of Assyrian at the University of Pennsylvania, dreamed that a Babylonian priest, associated with the king Kurigalzu, ( 1300 B.*c. ) escorted him to the treasure chamber of the temple of Bel, gave him six novel points of information about a certain broken relic, and corrected an error in its identification.
As a matter of fact, the incorrect classification, the result of many weeks of labor by Dr. Hilprecht, was about to be published by him the following day.
Some time later the missing part of the relic was found and the complete inscription, together with other new evidence, fully corroborated the ancient priest's information.
Dr. Hilprecht was uncertain as to the language used by the ancient priest in his dream.
He was almost positive it was not Assyrian nor Cassite, and imagined it must have been German or English.
We may conclude that all six points of information, ostensibly given by the dream priest, could have been furnished by Dr. Hilprecht's subconscious reasoning.
But, in denying any physical reality for this dream, how could the brain possibly compose that realistic, vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout, violent break or sudden substitution?
Which theory is more fantastic : 1.
That the perfect continuity was composed from the joblot of memory impressions in the professor's brain, or 2.
That the dream was a reality on the infinite progressions of universal, gradient frequencies, across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient Nippur met?
The degree of circumstance, the ratio of memory to forgetfulness, determines whether a dream will be a recognized, fulfilled prevision, or the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feeling.
No doubt some experiences vanish so completely as to leave no trace on the sleeper's mind.
Probably less than one percent of our previsions escape final obliteration before we wake.
When we arrive at the events concerned in the vanished majority, they, of course, cannot impress us as anything familiar.
Nevertheless, there are notably frequent instances of deja vue, in which our recognition of an entirely novel event is a feeling of having lived through it before, a feeling which, though vague, withstands the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologists.
If deja vue is an illusion, then peculiarly, it is a most prevalent mental disturbance affecting even the most level-headed people.
Chauncey Depew, one-time runner-up for the Republican Presidential nomination, was attending a convention at Saratoga, where he was scheduled to nominate Colonel Theodore Roosevelt for Governor of New York when he noticed that the temporary chairman was a man he had never met.
After the preliminary business affair was finished Depew arose and delivered the convincing speech that clinched the nomination for Roosevelt.
If Depew had told any academic psychologist that he had a weird feeling of having lived through that identical convention session at some time in the past, he would have been informed that he was a victim of deja vue.
But the famous orator felt more than vague recognition for the scene.
He remembered exactly when he had lived through it before, and he had something to prove he had.
One week before the convention, Depew was seated on the porch of a country home on the Hudson, gazing at the opposite shore.
The food is wonderful and it is a lot of fun to be here ] so wrote a ten year old student in a letter to his parents from North Country School, Lake Placid, New York.
In this one sentence, he unwittingly revealed the basic philosophy of the nutrition and psychological programs in operation at the school.
Because the food is selected with thought for its nutritional value, care for its origin, and prepared in a manner that retains the most nutrients, the food does taste good.
When served in a psychological atmosphere that allows young bodies to assimilate the greatest good from what they eat because they are free from tension, a foundation is laid for a high level of health that releases the children from physical handicaps to participate with enjoyment in the work assignments, the athletic programs and the most important phase, the educational opportunities.
Situated in a region of some of the loveliest mountain scenery in the country, the school buildings are located amid open fields and farm lands.
These contemporary structures, beautifully adapted to a school in the country, are home to 60 children, ages eight to fourteen, grades four through eight.
From fourteen states and three foreign countries they come to spend the months from mid-*september to June.
The Director, Walter E. Clark, believes that a school with children living full time in its care must take full responsibility for their welfare.
To him this means caring for the whole child, providing basic nutrition, and a spiritual attitude that lends freedom for the development of the mind.
Improved farming methods the concept of good nutrition really began with the garden.
The school has always maintained a farm to supply the needs of the school.
In a climate hostile to agriculture, Mr. Clark has had to keep alert to the most productive farm techniques.
Where a growing season may, with luck, allow 60 days without frost, and where the soil is poor, sandy, quick-drying and subject to erosion, many farmers fail.
Throughout the Adirondack region abandoned farm homes and wild orchards bear ghostly testimony that their owners met defeat.
Mr. Clark found that orthodox procedures of deep plowing, use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides, plus the application of conservation principles of rotation and contouring, did not prevent sheet erosion in the potato fields and depreciation of the soil.
To give up these notions required a revolution in thought, Mr. Clark said in reminiscing about the abrupt changes in ideas he experienced when he began reading Organic Gardening And Modern Nutrition in a search for help with his problems.
Louis Bromfield's writings excited me as a conservationist.
By 1952 he was convinced he would no longer spray.
He locked his equipment in a cabinet where it still remains.
After reading Plowman's Folly by Edward H. Faulkner, he stopped plowing.
The basis for compost materials already existed on the school farm with a stable of animals for the riding program, poultry for eggs, pigs to eat garbage, a beef herd and wastes of all kinds.
Separate pails were kept in the kitchen for coffee grounds and egg shells.
All these materials and supplementary manure and other fertilizers from neighboring dairy and poultry farms made over 40 tons of finished compost a year.
It was applied with a compost shredder made from a converted manure spreader.
Years of patient application of compost and leaf mulching has changed the structure of the soil and its water-holding capacity.
Soon after the method changed, visitors began asking how he managed to irrigate his soil to keep it looking moist, when in reality, it was the soil treatment alone that accomplished this.
To demonstrate the soil of his vegetable gardens as it is today, Mr. Clark stooped to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth.
Sniffing its sweet smell and letting it fall to show its good crumbly consistency, he pointed to the nearby driveway and said, this soil used to be like that hard packed road over there.
People and soils respond slowly, says Walter Clark, but the time has now come when the gardens produce delicious long-keeping vegetables due to this enrichment program.
No chemical fertilizers and poisonous insecticides and fungicides are used.
The garden supplies enough carrots, turnips, rutabagas, potatoes, beets, cabbage and squash to store for winter meals in the root cellar.
The carrots sometimes don't make it through the winter ; the cabbage and squash keep until March or April.
There is never enough corn, peas or strawberries.
Mr. Clark still has to use rotenone with potatoes grown on the least fertile fields, but he has watched the insect damage decrease steadily and hopes that continued use of compost and leaf mulch will allow him to do without it in the future.
A new project planned is the use of Bio-*dynamic Starter.
New ideas for improving nutrition came with the study of soil treatment.
After the soil, the kitchen, says Mr. Clark.
The first major change was that of providing wholewheat bread instead of white bread.
Adults take a long time to convince and you are thwarted if you try to push.
At first the kitchen help was tolerant, but ordered their own supply of white bread for themselves.
You can't make French toast with whole-wheat bread, was an early complaint.
Of course they learned in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread, but the children liked it better.
Homemade bread Mrs. Clark, as house manager, planned the menus and cared for the ordering.
Then Miss Lillian Colman came from Vermont to be kitchen manager.
Today whole grains are freshly ground every day and baked into bread.
Mr. Clark's studies taught him that the only way to conserve the vitamins in the whole grain was prompt use of the flour.
Once the grains are ground, vitamin *j begins to deteriorate immediately and half of it is lost by oxidation and exposure to the air within one week.
A mill stands in a room off the kitchen.
Surrounding it are metal cans of grains ordered from organic farms in the state.
Miss Colman pours measures of whole wheat, oats, and soy beans and turns on the motor.
She goes on about her work and listens for the completion of the grinding.
The bread baked from this mixture is light in color and fragrant in aroma.
It is well liked by the children and faculty.
There is one problem with the bread.
Lillian's bread is so good and everything tastes so much better here that it is hard not to eat too much, said the secretary ruefully eyeing her extra pounds.
Hot, freshly-ground cereal the school has not used cold prepared cereals for years, though at one time that was all they ever served.
When the chance came, they first eliminated cold cereal once a week, then gradually converted to hot fresh-ground cereal every day.
They serve cracked wheat, oats or cornmeal.
Occasionally, the children find steamed, whole-wheat grains for cereal which they call buckshot.
At the beginning of the school year, the new students don't eat the cereal right away, but within a short time they are eating it voraciously.
When they leave for vacations they miss the hot cereal.
The school has received letters from parents asking, what happened to Johnny?
He never used to like any hot cereal, now that's the only kind he wants.
Where can we get this cereal he likes so much?
Body-building foods salads are served at least once a day.
Vegetables are served liberally.
Most come from the root cellar or from the freezer.
Home-made sauerkraut is served once a week.
Sprouted grains and seeds are used in salads and dishes such as chop suey.
Sometimes sprouted wheat is added to bread and causes the children to remark, Lillian, did you put nuts in the bread today?
Milk appears twice a day.
The school raises enough poultry, pigs, and beef cattle for most of their needs.
Lots of cheese made from June grass milk is served.
Hens are kept on the range and roosters are kept with them for their fertility.
Organ meats such as beef and chicken liver, tongue and heart are planned once a week.
Also, salt water fish is on the table once a week.
For deserts, puddings and pies are each served once a week.
Most other desserts are fruit in some form, fresh fruits once daily at least, sometimes at snack time.
Dried fruits are purchased from sources where they are neither sulphured nor sprayed.
Apples come from a farm in Vermont where they are not sprayed.
Oranges and grapefruit are shipped from Florida weekly from an organic farm.
Finding sources for these high quality foods is a problem.
Sometimes the solution comes in unexpected ways.
Following a talk by Mr. Clark at the New York State Natural Food Associates Convention, a man from the audience offered to ship his unsprayed apples to the school from Vermont.
Wheat-germ, brewer's yeast and ground kelp are used in bread and in dishes such as spaghetti sauce, meat loaves.
Miss Colman hopes to find suitable shakers so that kelp can be available at the tables.
Raw wheat-germ is available on the breakfast table for the children to help themselves.
Very few fried foods are used and the use of salt and pepper is discouraged.
Drinking with meals is also discouraged ; pitchers of water merely appear on the tables.
Nothing is peeled.
The source is known so there is no necessity to remove insecticide residues.
The cooking conserves a maximum of the vitamin *j content of vegetables by methods which use very little water and cook in the shortest time possible.
Wholesome snacks, no candy since Mr. Clark believes firmly that the chewing of hard foods helps develop healthy gums and teeth, raw vegetables and raw whole-wheat grains are handed out with fresh fruit and whole-wheat cookies at snack time in the afternoons.
To solve the problem of the wheat grains spilling on the floor and getting underfoot, a ball of maple syrup boiled to candy consistency was invented to hold the grains.
On their frequent hikes into the nearby mountains, the children carry whole grains to munch along the trail.
They learn to like these so well that it isn't surprising to hear that one boy tried the oats he was feeding his horse at chore time.
They tasted good to him, so he brought some to breakfast to eat in his cereal bowl with milk and honey.
Maple syrup is made by the children in the woods on the school grounds.
This and raw sugar replace ordinary refined sugar on the tables and very little sugar is used in cooking.
Candy is not allowed.
Parents are asked in the bulletin to send packages of treats consisting of fruit and nuts, but no candy.
Nourishing meals Mr. Clark believes in a good full breakfast of fruit, hot cereal, milk, honey, whole-wheat toast with real butter and eggs.
The heavy meal comes in the middle of the day.
Soup is often the important dish at supper.
Homemade of meat, bones and vegetables, it is rich in dissolved minerals and vitamins.
The school finds that the children are satisfied with smaller amounts of food since all of it is high in quality.
The cost to feed one person is just under one dollar a day.
Outdoor exercises even before he saw the necessity of growing better food and planning good nutrition, Mr. Clark felt the school had a good health program.
Rugged outdoor exercise for an hour and a half every day in all kinds of weather was the rule.
A vigorous program existed in skiing, skating sports and overnight hiking.
Healthier children since the change to better nutrition, he feels he can report on improvements in health, though he considers the following statements observations and not scientific proof.
Visitors to the school ask what shampoo they use on the children's hair to bring out the sheen.
The ruddy complexion of the faces also brings comment.
Buffeted by swirling winds, the little green biplane struggled northward between the mountains beyond Northfield Gulf.
Wires whined as a cold November blast rocked the silver wings, but the engine roar was reassuring to the pilot bundled in the open cockpit.
He peered ahead and grinned as the railroad tracks came into view again below.
Good old iron compass ] he thought.
A plume of smoke rose from a Central Vermont locomotive which idled behind a string of gravel cars, and little figures that were workmen labored to set the ruptured roadbed to rights.
The girders of a shattered Dog River bridge lay strewn for half a mile downstream.
Vermont's main railroad line was prostrate.
And in the dark days after the Great Flood of 1927 -- the worst natural disaster in the state's history -- the little plane was its sole replacement in carrying the United States mails.
Rain of near cloudburst proportions had fallen for three full days and it was still raining on the morning of Friday, November 4, 1927, when officials of the Post Office Department's Railway Mail Service realized that their distribution system for Vermont had been almost totally destroyed overnight.
Clerks and postmasters shoveled muck out of their offices -- those who still had offices -- and wondered how to move the mail.
The state's railroad system counted miles of broken bridges and missing rights-of-way : it would obviously remain out of commission for weeks.
And once medicine, food, clothing and shelter had been provided for the flood's victims, communications and the mail were the next top problems.
From Burlington, outgoing mail could be ferried across Lake Champlain to the railroad at Port Kent, N. Y..
But what came in was piling up.
The nearest undisrupted end of track from Boston was at Concord, N. H..
When Governor Al Smith offered New York National Guard planes to fly the mail in and out of the state, it seemed a likely temporary solution, easing Burlington's bottleneck and that at Montpelier too.
The question was where to land?
There was no such thing as an airport in Vermont.
Burlington aviator John J. Burns suggested the parade ground southwest of Fort Ethan Allen, and soon a dozen hastily-summoned National Guard pilots were bringing their wide-winged Jenny and De*haviland two-seaters to rest on the frozen sod of the military base.
The only available field that could be used near flood-ravaged Montpelier was on the Towne farm off upper Main Street, a narrow hillside where takeoffs and landings could be safely made only under light wind conditions.
Over in Barre the streets had been deep in swirling water, and bridges were crumpled and gone.
Anticipating delivery of medicines and yeast by plane, Granite City citizens formed an airfield committee and with the aid of quarrymen and the 172nd Infantry, Vermont National Guard, laid out runways on Wilson flat, high on Millstone Hill.
The Barre Aviation Field was set to receive its first aircraft the Sunday following the flood.
Though the makeshift airports were ready, the York State Guard flyers proved unable to keep any kind of mail schedule.
They had courage but their meager training consisted of weekend hops in good weather, in and out of established airports, and the increasingly cold weather soon raised hob with the water cooled engines of their World War 1 planes.
It seemed like a good time for officials to use a recently-passed law empowering the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air.
They had to act fast, for letters were clogging the terminals.
Down in Concord, New Hampshire, was a flier in the right place at the right time : Robert S. Fogg, a native New Englander, had been a World War 1 flying instructor, barnstormer, and one of the original planners of the Concord Airport.
Tall, wiry, dark-haired Bob Fogg had already racked up one historical first in air mail history.
Piloting a Curtiss Navy *j flying boat off Lake Winnipesaukee in 1925, he had inaugurated the original Rural Delivery air service in America.
During the excitement following Lindbergh's flight to Paris earlier in 1927, dare devil aviators overnight became legendary heroes.
In Concord, Bob Fogg was the most prominent New Hampshire boy with wings.
Public-spirited backers staked him to a brand-new airplane, aimed at putting their city and state on the flying map.
The ship was a Waco biplane, one of the first two of its type to be fitted with the air cooled, 225/hp Wright radial engine known as the Whirlwind.
A trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-1/2 feet long, the Waco was entered to compete in the On-to-*spokane Air Derby of 1927.
As a matter of fact, Fogg and his plane didn't get beyond Pennsylvania in the race -- an engine oil leak forced him down -- but the flying service and school he started subsequently were first steps in paying off his wry-faced backers.
So with all this experience, Bob Fogg was a natural choice to receive the first Emergency Air Mail Star Route contract.
His work began just six days after the flood.
By airline from Concord to Burlington is a distance of about 150 miles, counting a slight deviation for the stop at either Barre or Montpelier.
The first few days Bob Fogg set his plane down on Towne field back of the State House when the wind was right, and used Wilson flat above Barre when it wasn't.
Between the unsafe Towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that was necessary to gain access to Wilson flat, arrangements at the state capital were far from satisfactory.
Each time in, the unhappy pilot, pushing his luck, begged the postal officials that met him to find a safer landing place, preferably on the flat-topped hills across the Winooski River.
But Fogg, they countered, we can't get over there.
And besides you seem to make it all right here.
It took a tragedy to bring things to a head.
After a week of precarious uphill landings and downwind takeoffs, Fogg one day looked down at the shattered yellow wreckage of an Army plane strewn across snow-covered Towne field.
Sent to Montpelier by Secretary Herbert Hoover, Red Cross Aide Reuben Sleight had been killed, and his pilot, Lt. Franklin Wolfe, badly injured.
With the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot had simply flown into the hillside.
Faced with this situation, Postmaster Charles F. Mc*kenna of Montpelier went with Fogg on a Burlington trip, and together they scouted the terrain on the heights of Berlin.
A long flat known as the St. John field seemed to answer their purpose, and since the Winooski bridges were at last passable, they decided to use it.
With a wary eye on the farmer's bull, Fred Somers of Montpelier and Mr. St. John marked the field with a red table cloth.
As a wind direction indicator, they tied a cotton rag to a sapling.
With these aids, and a pair of skiis substituting for wheels on the Waco, Bob Fogg made the first landing on what is now part of the Barre-*montpelier Airport on November 21, 1927.
Each trip saw the front cockpit filled higher with mail pouches.
During the second week of operations, Fogg received a telegram from the Post Office Department, asking him to put on two airplanes and make two flights daily, plus one Sunday trip.
Since Fogg's was a one-man, one-plane flying service, this meant that he would have to do both trips, flying alone 600 miles a day, under sub-freezing temperature conditions.
Over the weeks, America's first Star Route Air Mail settled into a routine pattern despite the vagaries of weather and the lack of ground facilities and aids to navigation.
Each morning at five Fogg crawled out of bed to bundle into flying togs over the furnace register of his home.
Always troubled by poor circulation in his feet, he experimented with various combinations of socks and shoes before finally adopting old-style felt farmer's boots with his sheepskin flying boots pulled over them.
A sheep-lined leather flying suit, plus helmet, goggles and mittens completed his attire for the rigors of the open cockpit.
The airman's stock answer to weren't you cold?
Became yes, the first half hour is tough, but by then I'm so numb I don't notice it ] as daylight began to show through the frosty windows, Fogg would place a call to William A. Shaw at the U. S. Weather Station at Northfield, Vermont, for temperature and wind-velocity readings.
Shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountains to be seen from his station.
Ceilings were judged by comparison with known mountain heights and cloud positions.
Later on in the day Fogg could get a better weather picture from the Burlington Weather Bureau supervised by Frank E. Hartwell.
Out at the airport each morning, Fogg's skilled mechanic Caleb Marston would have the Waco warmed up and running in the drafty hangar.
( he'd get the engine oil flowing with an electric heater under a big canvas cover.
) wishing to show that aviation was dependable and here to stay, Bob Fogg always made a point of taking off each morning on the dot of seven, disregarding rain, snow and sleet in true postal tradition.
Concord learned to set its clocks by the rackety bark of the Whirlwind's exhaust overhead.
Sometimes the pilot had to turn back if fully blocked by fog, but 85% of his trips were completed.
Plane radios were not yet available, and once in the air, Fogg flew his ship by compass, a good memory for landmarks as seen from above, and a capacity for dead reckoning and quick computation.
Often, threading through the overcast, he was forced to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling, skimming above the Winooski or the White River along the line of the broken railroad.
When driving rain or mist socked in one valley, Fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one, ranging from the Ottauquechee up to Danville in search of safe passage through the mountain passes.
The dependable Wright engine was never stopped on these trips.
It ticked over smoothly, idling while Fogg exchanged mails with the armed messenger from Burlington at Fort Ethan Allen, and one from Montpelier and Barre at the St. John field.
Sometimes, on a return trip, the aviator would go upstairs high over the clouds.
There he'd take a compass reading, figure his air speed, and deduce that in a certain number of minutes he'd be over the broad meadows of the Merrimack Valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit him.
Bob Fogg didn't have today's advantages of Instrument Flight and Ground Control Approach systems.
At the end of the calculated time he'd nose the Waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable.
Usually back in Concord by noon, there was just time to get partially thawed out, refuel, and grab a bit of Mrs. Fogg's hot broth before starting the second trip.
Day after day Fogg shuttled back and forth on his one-man air mail route, until the farmers in their snowy barnyards and the road repairmen came to recognize the stubby plane as their link with the rest of the country.
The flyer had his share of near-misses.
At Fort Ethan Allen the ever-present wind off Lake Champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculated.
Once the soldiers from the barracks had to hold the ship from blowing away while Fogg revved the engine and got the tail up.
At a nod of his head they let go, turning to cup their ears against the icy slipstream.
Tracks in the snow showed the plane was airborne in less than a hundred feet.
One afternoon during a cold, powdery snowstorm, Fogg took off for Concord from the St. John field.
Are you retiring now?
If so, are you saying, where did the last few years go?
How did I get to be sixty-five so fast?
What do I do now?
Yes, retirement seems to creep upon you suddenly.
Somehow we old-timers never figured we would ever retire.
We always thought we would die with our boots on.
Out of the blue comes talk of pension plans.
Compulsory retirement at sixty-five looms on our horizon.
Still, it seems in the far future.
Suddenly, one day, up it pops ] sixty-five years and you've had it ] so, now what?
Oh sure ] you've thought about it before in a hazy sort of way.
But ] it never seemed real ; never seemed as if it could happen to you ; only to the other fellow.
Now ] here it is ] how am I going to live?
What am I going to do?
Where do I go from here?
A great many retired people are the so-called white collar workers.
Are you one of these?
If so, you are of the old school.
You are conscientious, hard working, honest, accurate, a good penman, and a stickler for a job well done, with no loose ends.
Everything must balance to the last penny.
Also you can spell, without consulting a dictionary for every other word.
You never are late for work and seldom absent.
Actually, you can take no special credit for this.
It is the way you were taught and your way of life.
All this is standard equipment for a man of your day ; your stock in trade ; your livelihood.
However, the last few years of your life, things seem to be changing.
Your way doesn't seem to be so darned important any more.
You realize you are getting in the old fogy class.
To put it bluntly, you are getting out-moded.
What's happened?
The answer is a new era.
Now, looming on the horizon are such things as estimated totals, calculated risks and I.*b.*m. machines.
The Planning Dept. comes into existence.
All sorts of plans come to life.
This is followed by a boom in conferences.
Yes sir ] conferences become very popular.
When a plan burst its seams, hasty conferences supply the necessary patch, and life goes merrily on.
That's called progress ] the new way of life ] let's face it ] you had your day and it was a good day.
Let this generation have theirs.
Time marches on ] well, to get back to the problem of retirement.
Every retiring person has a different situation facing him.
Some have plenty of money -- some have very little money.
Some are blest with an abundance of good health -- some are in poor health and many are invalids.
Some have lovely homes -- some live in small apartments.
Some have beautiful gardens -- some not even a blade of grass.
Some have serenity of mind, the ability to accept what they have, and make the most of it ( a wonderful gift to have, believe me ) -- some see only darkness, the bitter side of everything.
Well, whatever you have, that's it ] you've got to learn to live with it.
Now ] the question is how are you going to live with it?
You can sit back and moan and bewail your lot.
Yes ] you can do this.
But, if you do, your life will be just one thing -- unhappiness -- complete and unabridged.
It seems to me, the first thing you've got to do, to be happy, is to face up to your problems, no matter what they may be.
Make up your mind to pool your resources and get the most out of your remaining years of life.
One thing, I am sure of, you must get an interest in life.
You've got to do something.
Many of you will say, well, what can I do?
Believe me ] there are many, many things to do.
Find out what you like to do most and really give it a whirl.
If you can't think of a thing to do, try something -- anything.
Maybe you will surprise yourself.
True ] we are not all great artists.
I, frankly, can't draw a straight line.
Maybe you are not that gifted either, but how about puttering around with the old paints?
You may amaze yourself and acquire a real knack for it.
Anyway, I'll bet you have a lot of fun.
Do you like to sew?
Does making your own clothes or even doll clothes, interest you?
Do you love to run up a hem, sew on buttons, make neat buttonholes?
If you do, go to it.
There is always a market for this line of work.
Some women can sit and sew, crochet, tat or knit by the hour, and look calm and relaxed and turn out beautiful work.
Where sewing is concerned, I'm a total loss.
When you see a needle in my hands you will know the family buttons have fallen off and I have to sew them back on, or get out the safety pins.
Then again, there's always that lovely old pastime of hooking or braiding rugs.
Not for me, but perhaps just the thing for you.
Well ] how's about mosaic tile, ceramics or similar arts and crafts?
Some people love to crack tile and it's amazing what beautiful designs they come up with as a result of their cracking good time.
How about the art of cooking?
Do you yearn to make cakes and pies, or special cookies and candies?
There is always an open market for this sort of delicacy, in spite of low calorie diets, cottage cheese and hands-off-all-sweets to the contrary.
Some people can carve most anything out of a piece of wood.
Some make beautiful chairs, cabinets, chests, doll houses, etc..
Perhaps you couldn't do that but have you ever tried to see what you could do with a hunk of wood?
Outside of cutting your fingers, maybe you would come up with nothing at all, but then again, you might turn out some dandy little gadgets.
Some women get a real thrill out of housework.
They love to dust, scrub, polish, wax floors, move the furniture around from place to place, take down the curtains, put up new ones and have themselves a real ball.
Maybe that's your forte.
It certainly isn't mine.
I can look at furniture in one spot year in and year out and really feel for sure that's where it belongs.
Perhaps you would like to become a writer.
This gives you a wide and varied choice.
Will it be short stories, fiction, nonfiction, biography, poetry, children's stories, or even a book if you are really ambitious?
Ever since I was a child, I have always had a yen to try my hand at writing.
If you do decide to write, you will soon become acquainted with rejection slips and dejection.
Don't be discouraged ] this is just being a normal writer.
Just let the rejection slips fall where they may, and keep on plugging, and finally you will make the grade.
Few new writers have their first story accepted, so they tell me.
But, it could happen, and it may happen to you.
Then there's always hobbies, collecting stamps, coins, timetables, salt and pepper shakers, elephants, dogs, dolls, shells, or shall we just say collecting anything your heart desires?
I can hear some of you folks protesting.
You say, but it costs a lot of money to have a hobby.
I haven't got that kind of money.
True ] it does cost a lot of money for most hobbies but there are hobbies that are for free.
How about a rock collection, or a collection of leaves from different trees or shrubs and in different colors?
Then, take flowers.
They are many and varied.
Also, there's scrap books, collecting newspaper pictures and clippings, or any items of interest to you.
It's getting interested in something that counts.
As for me, I am holding in reserve two huge puzzles ( I love puzzles ) to put together when time hangs heavy on my hands.
So far, the covers have never been off the boxes.
I just don't have time to do half the things I want to do now.
So in closing, fellow retired members, I advise you to make the most of each day, enjoy each one to the *j degree.
Travel, if you can.
Keep occupied to the point you are not bored with life and you will truly find these final days and years of your lives to be sunshine sweet.
Good luck ] to one and all -- good days ahead ] an important criterion of maturity is creativity.
The mature person is creative.
What does it mean to be creative, a term we hear with increasing frequency these days?
When we turn to Noah Webster we find him helpful as usual.
To be creative is to have the ability to cause to exist -- to produce where nothing was before -- to bring forth an original production of human intelligence or power.
We are creative, it seems, when we produce something which has not previously existed.
Thus creativity may run all the way from making a cake, building a chicken coop, or producing a book, to founding a business, creating a League of Nations or, developing a mature character.
All living creatures from the lowest form of insect or animal life evidence the power of creativity, if it is only to reproduce a form like their own.
While man shares this procreative function with all his predecessors in the evolutionary process, he is the only animal with a true non-instinctive and conscious creative ability.
An animal, bird or insect creates either a burrow, or nest or hive in unending sameness according to specie.
Man's great superiority over these evolutionary forbears is in the development of his imagination.
This gives him the power to form in his mind new image combinations of old memories, ideas and experiences and to project them outside of himself into his environment in new and ever-changing forms.
It has been truly said that anything man can imagine he can produce or create by projecting this inner image into its counterpart in the objective world.
In our own time we have seen the most fantastic imagery of a Jules Verne come into actuality.
The vision of a Lord Tennyson expressed in a poem 100 years ago took visible form over London in the air blitzes of 1941.
In fact all of our civilized world is the resultant of man's projection of his imagination over the past 60 centuries or more.
It is in this one aspect, at least, that man seems to be made in the image of his Creator.
Not only can man project his imagination out into his environment in concrete forms, but even more importantly, he can turn it inward to help create new and better forms of himself.
We recognize that young people through imaginative mind and body training can become athletes, acrobats, dancers, musicians and artists, developing many potentialities.
We know that actors can learn to portray a wide variety of character roles.
By this same combination of the will and the imagination, each one of us can learn to portray permanently the kind of character we would like to be.
We must realize with Prof. Charles Morris in his The Open Self that man is the being that can continually remake himself, the artisan that is himself the material for his own creation.
So far in history man has been too greatly over-occupied with projecting things into his environment rather than first creating the sort of person who can make the highest use of the things he has created.
Is not the present world crisis a race between things we have created which can now destroy us and between populations of sufficient wisdom and character to forestall the tragedy.
Is it not the obligation of us older citizens to lend our weight to being creative on the character side and to hasten our own maturing process?
Sir Julian Huxley in his book Uniqueness Of Man makes the novel point that just as man is unique in being the only animal which requires a long period of infancy and childhood under family protection, so is he the only animal who has a long period after the decline of his procreativity.
Some recent writings assume that the ignorant young couples are a thing of the remote, Victorian past ; that nowadays all honeymooners are thoroughly familiar with the best sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friends and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazards out of the situation.
Perhaps -- but extensive discussions with contemporary practitioners, family doctors and gynecologists indicate that this is still an area of enormous ignorance.
Joking and talking may be freer and easier, but the important factual information is still lacking for far too many newly-married men and women.
Various factors in the setting can still be of great advantage in making the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both.
Privacy must be highly assured both in time and place.
That is, locking the room or stateroom door gives privacy of location, but it is equally important to be sure there is time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment.
If the wedding party lasted late, and the travel schedule means there are only a few hours before resuming the trip or making an early start, the husband may forestall tensions and uncertainties by confiding to his bride that lying in each other's arms will be bliss enough for these few hours.
The consummation should come at the next stopping place when they have a long private time ( day or night ) for that purpose.
First intercourse for the bride brings with it the various problems connected with virginity and the hymen.
One thing should be clear to both husband and wife -- neither pain nor profuse bleeding has to occur when the hymen is ruptured during the first sex act.
Ignorance on this point has caused a great deal of needless anxiety, misunderstanding and suspicion.
The hymen is, in essence, a fragile membrane that more or less completely covers the entrance to the vagina in most female human beings who have not had sex relations.
( hymen, in fact, is the Greek word for membrane.
) often it is thin and fragile and gives way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse.
As might be expected, girls in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of losing their virginity.
It is also important to realize that many girls are born without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one ; so that the absence of the hymen is by no means positive proof that a girl has had sex relations.
But there is a basis in fact for the exaggerations of the folk-lore beliefs.
Some hymens are so strongly developed that they cannot be torn without considerable pain to the girl and marked loss of blood.
More rarely, the hymen is so sturdy that it does not yield to penetration.
Extreme cases are on record in which the doctor has had to use instruments to cut through the hymen to permit marital relations to be consummated.
These cases, for all their rarity, are so dramatic that friends and relations repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen is a serious problem to newly-weds.
In recent times, when sexual matters began to be discussed more scientifically and more openly, the emotional aspects of virginity received considerable attention.
Obviously, the bridal pair has many adjustments to make to their new situation.
Is it necessary to add to the other tensions the hazard of making the loving husband the one who brought pain to his bride?
Gynecologists and marriage manuals began to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage.
If he foresaw any problem because of the quality of the hymen, it was recommended that simple procedures be undertaken at once to incise the hymen or, preferably, to dilate it.
As a natural outgrowth of this approach it was often suggested that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilating the vagina.
This recommendation was based on the fact that the hymen was not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act.
The vagina is an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation.
This is obvious when it is remembered that, during childbirth, the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby.
The intricate system of muscles that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina are partly under voluntary control.
But an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman.
That is, when first penetration takes place, the pressure and pain signals may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscles to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent further pain.
The advantages of dilatation by the physician are both physical and psychological.
Since it is a purely professional situation, none of the pain is associated with love-making or the beloved.
By using instruments of gradually increasing size, the vagina is gently, and with minimum pain at each stage, taught to yield to an object of the appropriate shape.
In this process the vaginal muscles come under better conscious control by the girl.
She learns how to relax them to accept -- instead of contracting them to repel -- the entering object.
Apart from the standard problem of controlling the vaginal muscles, other serious barriers may exist that need special gynecological treatment.
It is far better to have such conditions treated in advance than to have them show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation.
When no medical problems exist, the newly married couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustments of their new relationship by themselves.
Special information and guidance about the possible difficulties are still of great value.
Folk-lore, superstition and remembered passages from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problems if blindly taken as scientific facts and useful hints.
The importance of loving tenderness is obvious.
The long, unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several levels.
Under the excitement of caresses and sexual stimulation the vagina relaxes and dilates and the local moisture greatly increases, providing an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easier penetration.
Extensive observations by physicians during vaginal examinations have established the fact that a single finger inserted along the anterior wall ( the top line of the vagina as the woman lies on her back ) may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin.
But during the same examination, two fingers may be inserted along the posterior wall ( the bottom of the vagina in the same position ) without any pain ; and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure is kept downward at all times.
These regional differences of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the earliest intercourse.
The husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind.
They may then adjust their positions and movements to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina ; at least until repeated intercourse has dilated it and pain is no longer a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making.
In fact, the technical procedure in medical examinations may be wisely adapted to his romantic purposes by the husband during the honeymoon.
Locker-room talk often stresses the idea that a man is doing the girl a favor if he is forceful and ruthless during the first penetration.
The false reasoning is that a gradual advance prolongs the pain while a swift powerful act gets it over with and leaves the girl pleased with his virility and grateful for his decisiveness in settling the problem once and for all.
Such talk is seriously in error.
Ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride, both physically and psychologically.
The insistent, forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal walls as well as do excessive damage to the hymen.
The pain and distress associated with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relations and cause her, unconsciously, to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercising her vaginal muscles to complicate his penetration instead of relaxing them to facilitate it.
Serious attention must also be given to the husband's problems in the honeymoon situation.
The necessity for keeping alert to his bride's hazards can act as an interference with the man's spontaneous desire.
The emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax.
This is a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife.
Or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wisest pace of the consummation can put him off stride and make it impossible for him to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period.
The signals to proceed may therefore come when he is momentarily not able to take advantage of them.
The best course is to recover his physical excitement by a change of pace that makes him ardent again.
This may require imagination and reminding himself that now he can be demanding and self-centered.
He can take security from the fact that the progress he has made by his gentle approach will not be lost.
Now while he uses talk, caresses or requires caresses from her, his bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help him restore his physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire.
A final word.
The accumulated information on this point shows that first intercourse, even when it is achieved with minimum pain or difficulty, is seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman.
Too many new things are happening for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment.
Only under rare circumstances would a bride experience an orgasm during her first intercourse.
Both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax, and even the absence of the anticipated keen pleasure are not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid.
If the early approaches are wise, understanding and patient, the satisfactions of marital fulfillment will probably be discovered before the marriage is much older.
Writing in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculptures, titled The Nude : A Study In Ideal Form, Kenneth Clark declares : the human body, as a nucleus, is rich in associations.
It is ourselves and arouses memories of all the things we wish to do with ourselves.
Perhaps this is a clue to the amazing variety and power of reactions, attitudes, and emotions precipitated by the nude form.
The wide divergence of reactions is clearly illustrated in the Kinsey studies in human sexuality.
Differences were related to social, economic, and educational backgrounds.
Whereas persons of eighth grade education or less were more apt to avoid or be shocked by nudity, those educated beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcomed and approved nudity in sexual relations.
Such understanding helps to explain why one matron celebrating thirty-five years of married life could declare with some pride that her husband had never seen her entirely naked, while another woman, boasting an equal number of years of married life, is proud of having shared the nudist way of life -- the really free, natural nude life -- for most of that period.
Attempts at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reactions.
The indignant crusader sees the nude or semi-nude human form as lewd and pornographic, a threat and danger to all the young, or good, or religious, or moral persons.
The equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the natural, honest, free expression of man's spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration.
One is always a little surprised to bump into such individual distinctions when it is unexpected.
I still recall the mild shock I experienced in reading material of an enthusiastic advocate of the clean, healthful, free way of natural life in nudism, who seemed to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit.
In tradition and in poetry, the marriage bed is a place of unity and harmony.
The partners each bring to it unselfish love, and each takes away an equal share of pleasure and joy.
At its most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares.
Everything else is closed away.
This is the ideal.
But marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved.
Instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship.
In the past, it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive.
But today there are signs that these roles are being reversed.
In a growing number of American homes, marriage counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships.
It is she who decides the time, the place, the surroundings, and the frequency of the sexual act.
It is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics -- not the husband.
The whole act is tailored to her pleasure, and not to theirs.
Beyond a certain point, of course, no woman can be dominant -- nature has seen to that.
But there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed.
Of course, there remain many old-fashioned marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy.
Yet even in these marriages, psychologists say, wives are asserting themselves more strongly.
The meekest, most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards.
To many experts, this trend was inevitable.
They consider it simply a sign of our times.
Our society has emancipated the woman, giving her new independence and new authority.
It is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role.
The sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum, declares Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and author of the recent book, Release From Sexual Tensions.
It reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself.
A world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more self-assertive, too.
Yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous.
It can, in fact, wreck a marriage.
When a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires, she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her.
And she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy.
On the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the husband, saps his self-respect, and robs him of his masculinity.
He is a target of ridicule to his wife, and often -- since private affairs rarely remain private -- to the outside world as well.
A marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness, declares Dr. Calderone.
This opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists, Dr. Maurice E. Linden, director of the Mental Health Division of the Philadelphia Department of Public Health.
When the roles of husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower, Dr. Linden says, the effects on their whole relationship, sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous.
In one extreme case, cited by a Pittsburgh psychologist, an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded.
To win her favors, her husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle from his employer.
Caught at last, he was sentenced to prison.
While he was in custody his wife divorced him.
More typical is the case of a suburban Long Island housewife described by a marriage counselor.
This woman repeatedly complained she was too tired for marital relations.
To please her, her husband assumed some of the domestic chores.
Finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the children, and even ironing -- and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them.
One wife, described by a New York psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between the weekly *j meetings and the Thursday-night neighborhood card parties.
Another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis.
After every money argument, she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor.
Experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed.
The wife is likely to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip -- often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage.
She knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband.
The husband is usually a well-educated professional, preoccupied with his job -- often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is : don't rock the boat.
Sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage.
Hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area.
More often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home.
Some psychologists, in fact, suggest that career-bound husbands often are more to blame for topsy-turvy marriages than their wives.
The wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend, is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job.
Naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative.
Unless her husband also desires sex, the act cannot be consummated.
Generally, however, in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at his wife's mercy.
The pattern, says Dr. Morton Schillinger, psychologist at New York's Lincoln Institute for Psychotherapy, is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night.
No one seriously contends, of course, that the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world.
After all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing, in literature and on the stage, as Dr. Schillinger points out.
There is no evidence that these Milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom.
Furthermore, Dr. Calderone says, a certain number of docile, retiring men always have been around.
They aren't frigid and they aren't homosexual ; they're just restrained in all of life.
They like to be dominated.
One such man once confided to Dr. Theodor Reik, New York psychiatrist, that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor.
Asked why, he replied primly : because that's no activity for a gentleman.
But such cases were, in the past, unusual.
Society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male -- even the Bible appears to endorse the concept.
Family survival on our own Western frontier, for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon ; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything, including the marriage bed.
This carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost in the best bull-roaring Life With Father manner.
In those days, a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere.
Grandma wasn't expected to like it, Dr. Marion Hilliard, the late Toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the '90s.
Wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as used by their husbands -- and, history indicates, they often quite literally were.
When was the turning point?
When did women begin to assert themselves sexually?
Some date it from woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin.
Virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs.
Left alone while her husband was miles away in the city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male.
Circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over child-rearing, money-handling and home maintenance.
She found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless.
She liked this taste of authority and independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up.
Very few wives, says Dr. Calderone, who balance the checkbook, fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned.
A woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well.
And an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually self-assertive -- the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response.
Marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax.
They began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response.
In fact, the noted psychologist and sex researcher, Dr. Albert Ellis, has declared flatly that women are sexually superior to men.
According to Dr. Ellis, the average 20-year-old American woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner.
Not surprisingly, Dr. Ellis says, some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities.
Yet, paradoxically, according to Dr. Maurice Linden, many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them.
An aggressive woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under.
When the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness, Dr. Linden says, the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate.
Often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction.
One such wife, Dr. Linden says, became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man.
But her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity.
Then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list.
In some cases, however, domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary, triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need.
Thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed -- the one place he can still be champion.
If his on-the-job problems work out, he may return to his old pattern.
Sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man -- or his wife -- because he or she feels age creeping up.
On the other hand, a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive -- asking, psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable.
Or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted.
In any case, Dr. Calderone remarks, such problems are a couple's own affair, and can't always be measured by a general yardstick.
As long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little difference if one or the other dominates, Dr. Calderone declares.
The important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment.
Other experts say, however, that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period, it is likely to shake the marriage.
And just as domination today often begins with the wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband.
To get a marriage back where it belongs, comments Dr. Schillinger of the Lincoln Institute, the husband must take some very basic steps.
He must begin, paradoxically, by becoming more selfish.
He must become more expressive of his own desires, more demanding and less understanding.
Too many husbands, Dr. Schillinger continues, worry about how well they're doing, and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play.
She gave herself a title, Lady Diana Harrington.
The New York D.*a. gave her another, The Golden Girl of cafe society.
Houston police gave her a third, less flamboyant, title, prostitute.
And Houston police have the final say in the matter since she died there on September 20, 1960, Diane Harris Graham, 30, D.*o.*a., circumstances -- unusual.
Early in her life she had discovered that where there were men, there was money, and with the two came luxury and liquor.
She was still in the play for pay business when she died, a top trollop who had given the world's oldest profession one of its rare flashes of glamour.
She never hid the fact that she liked to play.
Her neighbors in the expensive Houston apartment building told reporters that the ash-blonde beauty had talked at times about her past as the Golden Girl of the Mickey Jelke trial.
It was the trial of oleomargarine heir Minot ( Mickey ) Jelke for compulsory prostitution in New York that put the spotlight on the international play-girl.
( Jelke later served 21 months when he was found guilty of masterminding a ring of high-priced call girls.
) Diane was needed as a material witness in the case and New York police searched three continents before they found her in their own back yard -- in a swank hotel, of course.
She had been moving in cafe society as Lady Diana Harrington, a name that made some of the gossip columns.
It was when she was seized as a material witness that she got the designation she liked best.
Clad in mink and diamonds, she listened to Assistant District Attorney Anthony Liebler describe her to the arraigning judge : this girl is the Golden Girl of cafe society.
In 1951 she was a prostitute in New York County.
In the spring and early summer of that year she met a wealthy foreign tycoon who took her to France, where she later met a very wealthy man and toured all Europe with him.
At Deauville she met an Egyptian by the name of Pulley Bey.
He was the official procurer for King Farouk, now in exile.
She was in Egypt during the revolution and had passport difficulty.
She lied in order to get it.
We have checked her in different parts of Europe and Egypt and finally back into this country she has been acting as a prostitute.
Our information is that she gave the proceeds of her acts to Jelke.
Diane sobbingly denied this to the court.
That's a lie.
I never gave that boy a cent.
I am not a prostitute, and I had only one very wealthy boy friend, she said.
During the course of the trial, Jelke backed up part of that statement.
Diane is the type of girl, Jelke said, who wouldn't get loving -- even on her wedding night -- unless you piled up all your money in the middle of the floor.
But she seemed to have underestimated the number of her boy friends.
She came to New York from Detroit as a teenager, but with a sponsor instead of a chaperone.
As she told it, he's a rich boy friend, an old guy about 60.
She was Mary Lou Brew then, wide-eyed, but not naive.
She had talked her boy friend into sending her to New York to take a screen test.
The screen test was never made -- but Diane was.
She quickly moved into cafe society, possibly easing her conscience by talking constantly of her desire to be in show business.
She seemed so anxious to go on the stage that some of her friends in the cocktail circuit set up a practical joke.
An ex-fighter was introduced to her in a bar as Mr. Warfield, the famous producer.
The phony producer asked her if she would like to be in one of his shows.
I'd love to audition for you, she gushed.
The audition was held a few minutes later in somebody's apartment.
She thought she had great possibilities in the ballet and wanted to show the eminent producer how well she could dance.
After a few minutes he said, I can't use you if you dance like that.
I'd like to see you dance nude.
She hastily complied.
Diane loved to dance in the nude, something she was to demonstrate time and again.
She developed another quaint habit.
Even among the fast set in which she was moving, her method for keeping an escort from departing too early was unique.
When the date would try to bid her good-night at the door, she would tell him, if you go home now, I'll scream.
More often than not he would bow to the inevitable.
One who needed no such threats was a French financier.
One of the blonde's yearnings that he satisfied was for travel.
She wanted to go around the world, but she settled for a French holiday.
In an anonymous interview with a French newspaper the financier told of spending several months with her.
Then she went to Deauville where she met a member of a powerful Greek syndicate of gamblers.
The Greek evidently fell for her, Monsieur *j recounted, and to clinch what he thought was an affair in the making he gave her 100,000 francs ( about $300 ) and led her to the roulette tables.
She could do no wrong at the tables that time.
And in short order the croupier had pushed several million francs her way.
Smarter than most gamblers, she slipped away from the casino, packed her bag and took the night train to Paris.
No one ever learned what happened to the Greek.
The luxury of Paris' most fashionable hotel, the George 5, bored the beautifully-built blonde, so she high-tailed it to Rome.
She teamed up with another beauty, whose name has been lost to history, and commenced with some fiddling that would have made Nero envious.
To climax her Roman revels, she was thrown out of the swanky Hotel Excelsior after she had run naked through its marble halls screaming for help.
It was a rugged finish for what must have been a very interesting night.
Discreet Italian police described it in a manner typically continental.
There had been a threesome at the party in the suite's bedroom : Miss Harrington ( this was Diane's choice for a Roman name ), another woman who has figured in other very interesting events and one of your well-known American actors.
The actor had had much to drink and apparently became very violent.
The hotel staff, as well as residents of the Excelsior, told us they saw that both ladies were bleeding from scratches as they were seen fleeing down the hall.
They were wearing nothing but their scratches.
They were asked to leave the hotel.
No charges were filed.
The girls, after dressing, were indignant.
You can't do this to us, Diane screamed.
We are Americans.
In the morning she found rooms directly across from the Excelsior at the equally luxurious Hotel Ambassador.
With the Ambassador as headquarters, she continued to promote good will abroad.
Of course, her benevolence was limited to those who could afford it, but then there is a limit to what one person can do.
By this time Diane was a beguiling lass of 19 and still seeking her place in the world.
She thought royal status might come her way when, while she was still in Rome, she met Pulley Bey, a personal procurer to King Farouk of Egypt.
A close friend of hers in the Roman days described it this way : it was a strange relationship.
Pulley Bey spoke no English.
Diane spoke no Italian or French.
She had a hard time making him understand that it was Farouk she wished to meet.
Pulley Bey insisted that she bestow her favors on him, the friend continued.
It seemed as though she were always auditioning.
No believer in the traditional devotion of royal servitors, the plump Pulley broke the language barrier and lured her to Cairo where she waited for nine months, vainly hoping to see Farouk.
Pulley had set her up at the Semiramis Hotel, but she grew impatient waiting for a royal reception and moved to a luxurious apartment to which the royal pimp had no key.
She picked her own Middle-*eastern friends from the flock of ardent Egyptians that buzzed around her.
Tewfik Badrawi, Mohammed Gaafer and numerous other wealthy members of Cairo society enjoyed her company.
So extensive became her circle of admirers, Egyptian police said, that her escapades caused distrust.
The roof was about ready to fall in on Diane's little world, but it took nothing less than the Egyptian revolution to bring it down.
When Farouk was overthrown, police picked up his personal pimp, Pulley Bey.
They also called upon Diane with a request for a look at her passport.
The cagey Pulley Bey, who spoke no English, had taken the passport so that Diane couldn't leave the country without his approval.
Officials provided a temporary passport, good only for return to the United States.
And return to the United States she did, into waiting arms -- the unromantic ones of the New York District Attorney's office.
Held as a material witness in the compulsory prostitution trial of Mickey Jelke, the comely courtesan was unable to raise bail and was committed to the Women's House of Detention, a terribly overcrowded prison.
It is a tribute to her talents that she was able to talk the District Attorney into having her removed from the prison to a hotel room, with her meals taken at Vesuvio's, an excellent Italian restaurant.
Newspapers at the time noted that the move indicated that she was co-operating with the District Attorney.
With the end of the trial Diane disappeared from New York.
It was no longer fashionable to be seen with fabulous Lady Harrington.
Several years ago she married a Houston business man, Robert Graham.
She later divorced Graham, who is believed to have moved to Bolivia.
Houston police got to know Diane two years ago when the vice squad picked her up for questioning about a call girl ring.
Last May, they said, she admitted being a prostitute.
The next time the police saw her she was dead.
It was September 20, 1960, in a lavishly decorated apartment littered with liquor bottles.
She had had a party with a regular visitor, Dr. William W. Mc*clellan.
Mc*clellan, who had once lost his medical license temporarily on a charge of drug addiction, was with her when she died.
He had been in the apartment two days and was hazy about what had happened during that time.
When he realized she was dead, he called two lawyers and then the police.
When the police arrived, they found Mc*clellan and the two lawyers sitting and staring silently.
The blonde's nude body was in bed, a green sheet and a pink blanket covered her.
Pictures of her in more glamorous days were on the walls.
An autopsy disclosed a large amount of morphine in Diane's body.
Police theorize that a combination of dope, drink and drugs killed her.
I think that maybe she wanted it this way, a vice squad cop said.
A maid told us that she still bragged about getting $50 a date.
She was on the junk, and they slide fast when that happens.
At least she never knew what the bottom was like.
I am a carpet salesman.
I work for one of the biggest chains of retail carpet houses in the East.
We cater mostly to nice people in the $5-8,000 annual income bracket and we run a string of snazzy, neon-lit, chromium-plated suburban stores.
I am selling the stuff of which is made one of the Great American Dreams -- wall-to-wall carpeting.
There is only one trouble with this big, beautiful dream.
From where I sit it looks more like a nightmare.
People come to me with confidence.
They depend on my supposedly expert knowledge of a trade of which they themselves know little.
But I knowingly abuse their confidence.
Franklin D. Lee proved a man of prompt action when Mrs. Claire Shaefer, accompanied by a friend, visited him in Bakersfield, California, several months ago as a prospective patient.
Doctor Lee asked her to lie down on a bed and remove her shoes.
Then, by squeezing her foot three times, he came up -- presto -- with a different diagnosis with each squeeze.
She had -- he informed her -- kidney trouble, liver trouble, and a severe female disorder.
( he explained that he could diagnose these ailments from squeezing her foot because all of the nervous system was connected to it.
) he knew just the thing for her -- a treatment from his cosmic light ozone generator machine.
As he applied the applicator extending from the machine -- which consisted of seven differently colored neon tubes superimposed on a rectangular base -- to the supposedly diseased portions of Mrs. Shaefer's body, Lee kept up a steady stream of pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo.
Yes, the ozone from his machine would cure practically everything, he assured her.
Did she know, he asked, why the colors of the tubes were important to people's health?
The human body -- he pointed out, for example -- required 33 units of blue light.
For that reason, he informed her, the Lord made the sky blue.
Continuing glibly in this vein, he paused to comfort her : don't you worry.
This machine will cure your cancer-ridden body.
Cancer ] Mrs. Shaefer practically shrieked.
You didn't tell me I had cancer.
You have it, all right.
But as long as you can have treatment from my machine you have nothing to worry about.
Why, I once used this machine to cure a woman with 97 pounds of cancer in her body.
He urged her to buy one of his machines -- for $300.
When she said that she didn't have the money, he said that she could come in for treatment with his office model until she was ready to buy one.
He then sold her minerals to cure her kidney ailment, a can of sage to make her look like a girl again, and an application of plain mud to take her wrinkles away.
Lee renewed his pressure on Mrs. Shaefer to buy his machine when she visited him the next day.
After another treatment with the machine, he told her that her entire body was shot through with tumors and cysts.
He then sold her some capsules that he asserted would take care of the tumors and cysts until she could collect the money for buying his machine.
When she submitted to his treatment with the capsules, Mrs. Shaefer felt intense pain.
Leaving Lee's office, Mrs. Shaefer hurried over to her family physician, who treated her for burned tissue.
For several days, she was ill as a result of Lee's treatment.
Mrs. Shaefer never got around to joining the thousand or so people who paid Lee some $30,000 for his ozone machines.
For Mrs. Shaefer -- who had been given a clean bill of health by her own physician at the time she visited Lee -- and her friend were agents for the California Pure Food and Drug Inspection Bureau.
And she felt amply rewarded for her suffering when the evidence of Lee's quack shenanigans, gathered by the tape recorder under her friend's clothing, proved adequate in court for convicting Franklin D. Lee.
The charge : violation of the California Medical Practices Act by practicing medicine without a license and selling misbranded drugs.
The sentence : 360 days' confinement in the county jail.
An isolated case of quackery?
By no means.
Rather, it is typical of the thousands of quacks who use phony therapeutic devices to fatten themselves on the miseries of hundreds of thousands of Americans by robbing them of millions of dollars and luring them away from legitimate, ethical medical treatment of serious diseases.
The machine quack makes his Rube Goldberg devices out of odds and ends of metals, wires, and radio parts.
With these gadgets -- impressive to the gullible because of their flashing light bulbs, ticks, and buzzes -- he then carries out a vicious medical con game, capitalizing on people's respect for the electrical and atomic wonders of our scientific age.
He milks the latest scientific advances, translating them into his own special Buck Rogers vocabulary to huckster his fake machines as a cure-all for everything from hay fever to sexual impotence and cancer.
The gadget faker operates or sells his phony machines for $5 to $10,000 -- anything the traffic will bear.
He may call himself a anaprapath, a physiotherapist, an electrotherapist, a naturopath, a sanipractor, a medical cultist, a masseur, a doctor -- or what have you.
Not only do these quacks assume impressive titles, but represent themselves as being associated with various scientific or impressive foundations -- foundations which often have little more than a letterhead existence.
The medical device pirate of today, of course, is a far more sophisticated operator than his predecessor of yesteryear -- the gallus-snapping hawker of snake oil and other patent medicines.
His plunder is therefore far higher -- running into hundreds of millions.
According to the Food And Drug Administration ( F*d*a ), Doctor Ghadiali, Dr. Albert Abrams and his clique, and Dr. Wilhelm Reich -- to name three notorious device quacks -- succeeded, respectively, in distributing 10,000, 5000, and 2000 fake health machines.
Authorities believe that many of the Doctor Frauds using these false health gadgets are still in business.
Look at the sums paid by two device quack victims in Cleveland.
Sarah Gross, a dress shop proprietor, paid $1020 to a masseur, and Mr. A., a laborer, paid $4200 to a chiropractor for treatment with two fake health machines -- the radioclast and the diagnometer.
Multiply these figures by the millions of people known to be conned by medical pirates annually.
You will come up with a frightening total.
That's why the *j, the American Medical Association ( A*m*a ), and the National Better Business Bureau ( B*b*b ) have estimated the toll of mechanical quackery to be a substantial portion of the $610 million or so paid to medical charlatans annually.
The Postmaster General recently reported that mail order frauds -- among which fake therapeutic devices figure prominently -- are at the highest level in history.
Similarly, the American Cancer Society ( A*c*s ), the Arthritis and Rheumatism Foundation, and the *j have each stated lately that medical quackery is at a new high.
For example, the *j has reported it was receiving four times as many inquiries about quack devices and 10 times as many complaints compared with two years ago.
Authorities hesitate to quote exact figures, however, believing that any sum they come up with is only a surface manifestation -- turned up by their inevitably limited policing -- of the real loot of the medical racketeer.
In this sense, authorities believe that all estimates of phony device quackery are conservative.
The economic toll that the device quack extracts is important, of course.
But it is our health -- more precious than all the money in the world -- that these modern witch doctors with their fake therapeutic gadgets are gambling away.
By preying on the sick, by playing callously on the hopes of the desperate, by causing the sufferer to delay proper medical care, these medical ghouls create pain and misery by their very activity.
Typically, Sarah Gross and Mr. *j both lost more than their money as the result of their experiences with their Cleveland quacks.
Sarah Gross found that the treatments given her for a nervous ailment by the masseur were not helping her.
As a result, she consulted medical authorities and learned that the devices her quack doctor was using were phony.
She suffered a nervous breakdown and had to be institutionalized.
Mr. A., her fellow townsman, also experienced a nervous breakdown just as soon as he discovered that he had been bilked of his life savings by the limited practitioner who had been treating his wife -- a woman suffering from an incurable disease, multiple sclerosis -- and himself.
Mr. *j has recovered, but he is, justifiably, a bitter man.
That's a lot of hard-earned money to lose, he says today.
Neither me nor my wife were helped by that chiropractor's treatments.
And there was the case of Tom Hepker, a machinist, who was referred by a friend to a health machine quack who treated him with a so-called diagnostic machine for what Doctor Fraud said was a system full of arsenic and strychnine.
After his pains got worse, Tom decided to see a real doctor, from whom he learned he was suffering from cancer of the lung.
Yes, Tom caught it in time to stay alive.
But he's a welfare case now -- a human wreck -- thanks to this modern witch doctor.
But the machine quack can cause far more than just suffering.
In such diseases as cancer, tuberculosis, and heart disease, early diagnosis and treatment are so vital that the waste of time by the patient with Doctor Fraud's cure-all gadget can prove fatal.
Moreover, the diabetic patient who relies on cure by the quack device and therefore cuts off his insulin intake can be committing suicide.
For instance : in Chicago, some time ago, Mr. H., age 27, a diabetic since he was six, stopped using insulin because he had bought a magic spike -- a glass tube about the size of a pencil filled with barium chloride worth a small fraction of a cent -- sold by the Vrilium Company of Chicago for $306 as a cure-all.
Hang this around your neck or attach it to other parts of your anatomy, and its rays will cure any disease you have, said the company.
Mr. H. is dead today because he followed this advice.
Doris Hull, suffering from tuberculosis, was taken by her husband to see Otis G. Carroll, a sanipractor -- a licensed drugless healer -- in Spokane.
Carroll diagnosed Mrs. Hull by taking a drop of blood from her ear and putting it on his radionic machine and twirling some knobs ( fee $50 ).
His prescription : hot and cold compresses to increase her absorption of water.
Although she weighed only 108 pounds when she visited him, Carroll permitted her to go on a 10-day fast in which she took nothing but water.
Inevitably, Mrs. Hull died of starvation and tuberculosis, weighing 60 pounds.
Moreover, her husband and child contracted T.*b. from her.
( small wonder a Spokane jury awarded the husband $35,823 for his wife's death.
) in California, a few years ago, a ghoul by the name of H. F. Bell sold electric blankets as a cure for cancer.
He did this by the charming practice of buying up used electric blankets for $5 to $10 from survivors of patients who had died, reconditioning them, and selling them at $185 each.
When authorities convicted him of practicing medicine without a license ( he got off with a suspended sentence of three years because of his advanced age of 77 ), one of his victims was not around to testify : he was dead of cancer.
By no means are these isolated cases.
Unfortunately, says Chief Postal Inspector David H. Stephens, who has prosecuted many device quacks, the ghouls who trade on the hopes of the desperately ill often cannot be successfully prosecuted because the patients who are the chief witnesses die before the case is called up in court.
Death ] have no doubt about it.
That's where device quackery can lead.
The evidence shows that fake therapeutic machines, substituted for valid medical cures, have hastened the deaths of thousands.
Who are the victims of the device quacks?
Authorities say that oldsters are a prime target.
Says Wallace F. Jannsen, director of the *j Division of Public Information : quacks are apt to direct their appeal directly to older people, or to sufferers from chronic ailments such as arthritis, rheumatism, diabetes, and cancer.
People who have not been able to get relief from regular medical doctors are especially apt to be taken in by quacks.
The victims of the quacks are frequently poor people, like Mr. A., who scrape up their life savings to offer as a sacrifice to Doctor Fraud's avarice.
They are often ignorant as well as underprivileged.
Ten-year-old Richard Stewart had been irritable and quarrelsome for almost a year.
His grades had gone steadily downhill, and he had stopped bringing friends and classmates home from school.
Mr. and Mrs. Stewart were puzzled and concerned.
Then one day Dick's classmate Jimmy, from next door, let the cat out of the bag.
The youngsters in the boys' class had nicknamed Dick Bugs Bunny because his teeth protruded.
When Richard's parents told him they wanted to take him to an orthodontist -- a dentist who specializes in realigning teeth and jaws -- their young son was interested.
During the year that followed, Dick co-operated whole-heartedly with the dentist and was delighted with the final result achieved -- an upper row of strong straight teeth that completely changed his facial appearance.
Richard Stewart is no special case.
The majority of children in the United States could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment, says Dr. Allan G. Brodie, professor and head of the department of orthodontics at the University of Illinois and a nationally recognized authority in his field.
What do parents need to know about those years of the braces in order not to waste a child's time and their money?
How can they tell whether a child needs orthodontic treatment?
Why and when should tooth-straightening be undertaken?
What is it likely to cost?
Tooth fit explained occlusion is the dentist's expression for the way teeth fit together when the jaws are closed.
Malocclusion, or a bad fit, is what parents need to look out for.
One main type of malocclusion is characterized by a receding chin and protruding upper front teeth.
A chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face, a thrusting forward of the lower front teeth, an overdeveloped lower jawbone, and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion.
These two basic malformations have, of course, many variations.
A child probably requires some form of treatment if he has any of the following conditions : a noticeable protrusion of the upper or lower jaw.
Crooked, overlapping, twisted, or widely spaced teeth.
Front teeth not meeting when the back teeth close.
Upper teeth completely covering the lowers when the back teeth close.
The eyeteeth ( third from the middle on top, counting each front tooth as the first ) beginning to protrude like fangs.
Second teeth that have come in before the first ones have fallen out, making a double row.
Contrary to the thinking of 30 to 40 years ago, when all malocclusion was blamed on some unfortunate habit, recent studies show that most tooth irregularity has at least its beginning in hereditary predisposition.
However, this does not mean that a child's teeth or jaws must necessarily resemble those of someone in his family.
Tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb- or finger-sucking, tongue-thrusting, or lip-sucking -- but it's important to remember that there's a difference between normal and excessive sucking habits.
It's perfectly normal for babies to suck their thumbs, and no mother need worry if a child continues this habit until he is two or three years old.
Occasional sucking up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster's teeth ; but after that, if thumb-sucking pressure is frequent, it will have an effect.
Malocclusion can also result if baby teeth are lost too soon or retained too long.
If a child loses a molar at the age of two, the adjoining teeth may shift toward the empty space, thus narrowing the place intended for the permanent ones and producing a jumble.
If baby teeth are retained too long, the incoming second teeth may be prevented from emerging at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place.
Correction can save teeth every orthodontist sees children who are embarrassed by their malformed teeth.
Some such youngsters rarely smile, or they try to speak with the mouth closed.
In certain cases, as in Dick Stewart's, a child's personality is affected.
Yet from the dentist's point of view, bad-fitting teeth should be corrected for physical reasons.
Bad alignment may result in early loss of teeth through a breakdown of the bony structure that supports their roots.
This serious condition, popularly known as pyorrhea, is one of the chief causes of tooth loss in adults.
Then, too, misplaced or jammed-together teeth are prone to trapping food particles, increasing the likelihood of rapid decay.
For these and other reasons, says Dr. Brodie, orthodontics can prolong the life of teeth.
The failure of teeth to fit together when closed interferes with normal chewing, so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on his digestive system.
Because of these chewing troubles, a child may avoid certain foods he needs for adequate nutrition.
Badly placed teeth can also cause such a speech handicap as lisping.
The when and how of straightening most orthodontic work is done on children between the ages of 10 and 14, though there have been patients as young as two and as old as 55, says Dr. Brodie.
In the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of teeth is usually completed, yet the continuing growth of bony tissue makes moving badly placed teeth comparatively easy.
Orthodontic work is possible because teeth are held firmly but not rigidly, by a system of peridontal membrane with an involved nerve network, to the bone in the jaw ; they are not anchored directly to the bone.
Abnormal pressure, applied over a period of time, produces a change in the bony deposit, so a tooth functions normally in the new position into which it has been guided.
What can 10-year-old Susan expect when she enters the orthodontist's office?
On her first visit the orthodontist will take x-rays, photographs, tooth measurements, and tooth prints -- an impression of the mouth that permits him to study her teeth and jaws.
If he decides to proceed, he will custom-make for Susie an appliance consisting of bands, plastic plates, fine wires, and tiny springs.
This appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone.
As the tooth moves, bone cells on the pressure side of it will dissolve, and new ones will form on the side from which the tooth has moved.
This must be done at the rate at which new bony tissue grows, and no faster.
If teeth are moved too rapidly, serious injury can be done to their roots as well as to the surrounding bone holding them in place, explains Dr. Brodie.
Moving one or two teeth can affect the whole system, and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child's face.
During the first few days of wearing the appliance and immediately following each adjustment, Susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness, but after a short time this will disappear.
Parents are often concerned that orthodontic appliances may cause teeth to decay.
When in place, a well-cemented band actually protects the part of the tooth that is covered.
Next Susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month, depending on the severity of her condition.
During these visits the dentist will adjust the braces to increase the pressure on her teeth.
Last comes the retention stage.
Susie's teeth have now been guided into a desirable new position.
But because teeth sometimes may drift back to their original position, a retaining appliance is used to lock them in place.
Usually this is a thin band of wire attached to the molars and stretching across the teeth.
Susie may wear this only at night or for a few hours during the day.
Then comes the time when the last wire is removed and Susie walks out a healthier and more attractive girl than when she first went to the orthodontist.
How long will this take?
Straightening one tooth that has come in wrong may take only a few months.
Aligning all the teeth may take a year or more.
An added complication such as a malformed jaw may take two or three years to correct.
What is the cost?
The charge for a complete full-banded job differs in various parts of the country.
Work that might cost $500 to $750 in the South could cost $750 to $1,200 in New York City or Chicago.
An average national figure for two to three years of treatment would be $650 to $1,000.
Factors in the cost of treatment are the length of time involved and the skill and education of the practitioner, says Dr. Brodie.
To become an orthodontist, a man must first be licensed by his state as a dentist, then he must spend at least two years in additional training to acquire a license as a specialist.
Costs may seem high, but they used to be even higher, says Dr. Brodie.
Fees are about half to a third of what they were 25 years ago.
The reason?
People today are aware of the value of orthodontics, and as a result there are more practitioners in the field.
Most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic materials and construction of the appliances, but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of months or years.
In many cities in the United States clinics associated with dental schools will take patients at a nominal fee.
Some municipal agencies will pay for orthodontic treatment for children of needy parents.
Research helps families growth studies have been carried on consistently by orthodontists.
Dr. Brodie has 30-year records of head growth, started 20 minutes after children's births.
In the past anyone who said that 90% of all malocclusion is hereditary was scoffed at ; now we know that family characteristics do affect tooth formation to a large extent, he says.
Fortunately through our growth studies we have been able to see what nature does, and that helps us know what we can do.
This knowledge both modifies and dictates diagnosis and treatment.
For example, a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large teeth from another.
In the past an orthodontist might have tried, over four or five years, to straighten and fit the boy's large teeth into a jaw that, despite some growth, would never accommodate them.
Now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately.
In other cases, in view of present-day knowledge of head growth, orthodontists will recommend waiting four or five years before treatment.
The child is kept on call, and the orthodontist watches the growth.
Nature often takes care of the problem, says Dr. Brodie.
A child with a certain type of head and teeth will outgrow tooth deformity.
That is why Dr. Brodie asks parents not to insist, against their dentist's advice, that their child have orthodontic work done too early.
Both because of our culture's stress on beauty and our improved economic conditions, some parents demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it is wise to do so.
Let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment, he urges.
Superior new material for orthodontic work is another result of research.
Plastics are easier to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly used, and they save time and money.
Plaster of Paris, once utilized in making impressions of teeth, has been replaced by alginates ( gelatin-like material ) that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child.
Prevention is best as a rule, the earlier general dental treatment is started, the less expensive and more satisfactory it is likely to be.
After your child's baby teeth are all in -- usually at the age of two and one half to three -- it's time for that first dental appointment, Dr. Brodie advises.
Then see that your youngster has a routine checkup once a year.
To help prevent orthodontic problems from arising, your dentist can do these things : he can correct decay, thus preventing early loss of teeth.
If a child does lose his first teeth prematurely because of decay -- and if no preventive steps are taken -- the other teeth may shift out of position, become overcrowded and malformed.
In turn the other teeth are likely to decay because food particles may become impacted in them.
From time to time the medium mentions other people around him, who were on the other side, and reports what they are saying.
After a while there come initials and names, and he is interested to hear some rather unusual family nicknames.
As the hour progresses, the sensitive seems to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statements.
There are a few prognoses of coming events.
Another medium, another sitter, would produce a somewhat different content, but in general it would probably sound much like the foregoing reading.
Some mediums speak in practical, down-to-earth terms, while others may stress the spiritual.
Not all, as a matter of fact, consider themselves mediums in the sense of receiving messages from the deceased.
In fact, some sensitives rule this out, preferring to consider their expression as strictly extra-sensory perception ( E*s*p ), on this side of the veil.
However that may be, people are known to go to mediums for diverse reasons.
Perhaps they are mourning a recent death and want comfort, to feel in touch with the deceased, or seek indications for future plans.
They may, of course, be curiosity seekers -- or they may just be interested in the phenomenon of mediumship.
The mediums with whom the Parapsychology Foundation is working in this experiment are in a waking or only slightly dissociated state, so that the sitter can make comments, ask and answer questions, instead of talking with a control who speaks through an entranced sensitive.
What we have here is in some ways more like an ordinary conversation.
But it is not really only a conversation.
Many a sitter ( in a personal sitting ) has been amazed to realize that the medium was describing very vividly his state of mind.
He himself might not have been really aware of his own mood ; it had been latent, unspecified, semi-conscious and only partly realized -- until she described it to him ] most striking indeed is this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on pre-conscious moods and to clarify them.
However, in the next visit that the researcher made to the medium, he did not receive a personal reading.
Instead he brought with him the names of some people he had never met and of whom the medium knew nothing.
For this was to be a proxy sitting.
As was noted earlier, it is important that in valid, objective study of this sort of communication, the interested sitter should be separated from the sensitive.
Dr. Karlis Osis, Director of Research at the Parapsychology Foundation, described the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article, ( New Research On Survival After Death, Spring 1958 ).
He remarked : it has been clearly established that in a number of instances the message did not come from a spirit but was received telepathically by the medium from the sitter.
The possibility has to be ruled out that the medium's *j may tap the memory of the sitter, and to do this, the two central characters in this drama must be separated.
One way to do this is by proxy sittings, wherein the person seeking a message does not himself meet with the medium but is represented by a substitute, the proxy sitter.
If the latter knows nothing about the absent sitter except his name ( given by the experimenter ), he cannot possibly give any clues, conscious or unconscious, far less ask leading questions.
All he can do is to be an objective and careful questioner, seeking to help the sensitive in clarifying and making more specific her paranormal impressions.
Sometimes in these experiments appointment sittings are used.
Here the absent sitter makes a date with a communicator ( someone close to him who is deceased ), asking him to come in at a certain hour, when a channel will be open for him.
In this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator, nothing else.
He gives this to the medium at the appointed time, and the reading then will be concerned with material about or messages from the communicator.
As always, a tape recording or detailed notes are made, and a typescript of this is sent to the absent sitter.
So this proxy situation has set up at least a partial barrier between the medium's *j and the absent sitter's mind.
It is now harder to assume telepathy as a basis for the statements -- though research still does not know how far afield *j can range.
Now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statements are meaningful to him.
Here again laboratory approaches are being evolved, for it is recognized how elastic these readings can be, how they can apply to many people, and are often stated in general terms all too easily applied to any individual's own case.
If you look at a reading meant for someone else, you will probably see that many of the items could be considered as applicable to you, even when you were not in the picture at all ] an interested sitter may think the sensitive has made a hit, describing something accurately for him, but can he really be sure that another sitter, hearing the same statement, would not apply it subjectively to his own circumstances?
It is, of course, easy to see how *j will mean Uncle Jack to one person and little Jane to another.
A journey, a little white house, a change of outlook, can apply to many people.
And even more complex items can be interpreted to conform to one's own point of view, which is by nature so personal.
One sitter may think a leather couch identifies a reading as surely directed to him ; to another, it seems that nobody but his father ever used the phrase, atta boy ] to get around this quite difficult corner, there is one first aid to objectiveness : prevent the distant sitter from knowing which reading was for him.
If he is not told which of four or five readings was meant for him, he can more readily assess each item in a larger frame : does that statement really sound as if it were for me, significant in my particular life?
Or am I taking something that could really apply to almost anybody, and forgetting that many other people probably have had a similar experience?
Conversely, experimenters would consider as impressive such statements as the following, which, if they turned out to be hits, are so unusual as to be really significant : he had four children, two sets of twins.
After being a lawyer for twenty-five years he started studying for the ministry.
Part of his house had been moved to the other side of the road.
He died of typhoid in 1921.
Methods have been developed of assigning weights to statements ; that is, it is known empirically that names beginning with *j are more common than those beginning with *j ; that fewer women are named Miranda than Elizabeth ; that in the United States more people die of heart disease than of smallpox.
So each reading can be given a weight and each reading a score by adding up these weights.
Specific dates would be important, as would double names.
Various categories have been explored to find out about these empirical probabilities against which to measure the readings.
In the parapsychology foundation's long-range experiment, readings are made by a variety of sensitives for a large number of cooperating sitters, trying to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statements.
It is very important indeed, in the field of extra-sensory perception and its relation to the survival hypothesis, to know whether the statements are actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself.
Or, on the other hand, are unlikely facts being stated, facts which are in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody?
That is one thing the experiments are designed to find out.
So, after the sitting has been held, several readings at one time are mailed, and the distant sitter ( whose name or whose communicator's name was given to the medium ) must mark each little item as Correct ( Hit ), Incorrect ( Miss ), Doubtful, or Especially Significant ( applying to him and, he feels, not to anyone else ).
He is required to mark every item and to indicate which reading he feels is actually his.
All these evaluations are then totted up and tabulated, by adding up the Hits and Significants, with the weight placed on those in the sitter's own reading.
That is, if he marks as most correct a reading not meant for him, the total experimental score falls.
Conversely, if he gives a heavy rating to his own reading, and finds more accurate facts in it than in the others, a point is chalked up for the intrinsic, objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material.
And there are some positive results, though the final findings will not be known for a long time -- and then further research can be formulated.
In another approach to the same procedure, the content of the readings is analyzed so as to see how the particular medium is likely to slant her statements.
Does she often speak of locations, of cause of death?
Does she accurately give dates, ages, kind of occupation?
It is possible to find out in which categories most of her correct statements fall, and where she makes most of her hits.
Now when, so to speak, the cream has been skimmed off, and the items in the successful categories separated out, the sitter can be asked to consider and rate only this concentrated cream, where the sensitive is at her best.
Mediumistic impressions are evidently of all sorts and seem to involve all the senses.
I feel cold, the medium says, or my leg aches, my head is heavy.
Or perhaps she hears words or sounds : there's such a noise of loud machinery, or I hear a child crying, or he says we're all here and glad to see you.
Maybe an entire scene comes into consciousness, with action and motion, or a static view : a house under a pine tree, with a little stone path going up to the door.
The sensitive often seems to smell definite odors, too, or subjectively feels emotions.
Sometimes she displays amazing eidetic imagery and seems to see all details in perspective, as if the scene were actually there.
If pressed by the sitter for more detail, she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply, almost as if she were physically going closer.
If asked how she gets her impressions, she probably can only say that she just gets them -- some more vividly than others.
Perhaps this is not so extraordinary after all.
Even in normal experience one gets impressions without knowing exactly how -- of atmosphere, of one another's personalities, moods, intentions.
Of course, there is an element of training here : these gifted people, by concentration, study, guidance, have learned to develop their power.
Simply using it increases its intensity, I was told by one sensitive.
Nor does a medium automatically know how to interpret her imagery.
Impressions often appear in a symbolic form and cannot be taken at face value.
It is apparently by symbols that the unconscious speaks to the conscious, and the medium has to translate these into meaning.
If communication with an entity on the other side is taking place, this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism.
During one reading an image appeared of a prisoner in irons.
But this did not necessarily refer to an actual jail ; taken with other details it could have referred to a state of mental or spiritual confinement.
In this connection it is worth noting how names are sometimes obtained.
Though they are often heard clairaudiently, as if a voice were speaking them, in other cases they are apprehended visually as symbols : a slope to signify the name Hill, for instance.
One medium saw two sheets flapping on a line and found that the name Shietz was significant to the sitter.
Farming is confining.
The farmer's life must be arranged to meet the demands of crops and livestock.
Livestock must be tended every day, routinely.
A slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cows or chickens.
Even if there are no livestock, the farmer cannot leave the farm for long periods, particularly during the growing season.
The worker who lives on a farm cannot change jobs readily.
He cannot leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice ; such a move may mean a loss of capital.
Hard physical labor and undesirable hours are a part of life.
The farmer must get up early, and, at times, work late at night.
Frequently he must work long hours in the hot sun or cold rain.
No matter how well work is planned, bad weather or unexpected setbacks can cause extra work that must be caught up.
It may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably.
Production may fall far below expectations.
Drought, hail, disease, and insects take their toll of crops.
Sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner's earnings, even into his capital.
Returns for money and labor invested may be small even in a good year.
The high cost of land, supplies, and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis.
Land within commuting distance of a growing city is usually high in price, higher if it has subdivision possibilities.
Part-time farmers generally must pay higher prices for supplies than full-time farmers because they buy in smaller quantities.
If the farm is in an industrial area where wages are high, farm labor costs will also be high.
A part-time farmer needs unusual skill to get as high production per hen, per cow, or per acre as can be obtained by a competent full-time farmer.
It will frequently be uneconomical for him to own the most up-to-date equipment.
He may have to depend upon custom service for specialized operations, such as spraying or threshing, and for these, he may have to wait his turn.
There will be losses caused by emergencies that arise while he is away at his off-farm job.
The farm may be an additional burden if the main job is lost.
This may be true whether the farm is owned or rented.
If the farm is rented, the rent must be paid.
If it is owned, taxes must be paid, and if the place is not free of mortgage, there will be interest and payments on the principal to take care of.
Advantages a farm provides a wholesome and healthful environment for children.
It gives them room to play and plenty of fresh air.
The children can do chores adapted to their age and ability.
Caring for a calf, a pig, or some chickens develops in children a sense of responsibility for work.
Part-time farming gives a measure of security if the regular job is lost, provided the farm is owned free of debt and furnishes enough income to meet fixed expenses and minimum living costs.
For some retired persons, part-time farming is a good way to supplement retirement income.
It is particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of doors for their health.
Generally, the same level of living costs less in the country than in the city.
The savings are not as great, however, as is sometime supposed.
Usually, the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utilities somewhat more.
Where schools, fire and police protection, and similar municipal services are of equal quality in city and country, real estate taxes are usually about the same.
A part-time farmer and his family can use their spare time profitably.
Some persons consider the work on a farm recreational.
For some white-collar workers it is a welcome change from the regular job, and a physical conditioner.
Land, labor, and equipment needed part-time farming can take comparatively little land, labor, and equipment -- or a great deal.
It depends on the kind and the scale of the farming operation.
General requirements for land, labor, and equipment are discussed below.
Specific requirements for each of various types of enterprises are discussed on pages 8 to 14.
Land three quarters to 1 acre of good land is enough for raising fruits and vegetables for home use, and for a small flock of chickens, a cow, and two pigs.
You could not, of course, raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small.
If you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a larger scale, you'll need more land.
In deciding how much land you want, take into account the amount you'll need to bring in the income you expect.
But consider also how much you and your family can keep up along with your other work.
The cost of land and the prospects for appreciation in value may influence your decision.
Some part-time farmers buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development.
This is a highly speculative venture.
Sometimes a desired acreage is offered only as part of a larger tract.
When surplus land is not expensive to buy or to keep up, it is usually better to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoining properties might impair the residential value of the farm.
Labor if you have a year-round, full-time job you can't expect to grow much more than your family uses -- unless other members of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help.
As a rule, part-time farmers hire little help.
In deciding on the enterprises to be managed by family labor, compare the amount of labor that can be supplied by the family with the labor needs of various enterprises listed in table 1.
List the number of hours the family can be expected to work each month.
You may want to include your own regular vacation period if you have one.
Do not include all your spare time or all your family's spare time -- only what you are willing to use for farm work.
Equipment if you are going to produce for home use only, you will need only hand tools.
You will probably want to hire someone to do the plowing, however.
For larger plantings, you'll need some kind of power for plowing, harrowing, disking, and cultivating.
If you have a planting of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor ( available for $300 to $500 with attachments, 1960 prices ).
These tractors are not entirely satisfactory for plowing, particularly on heavier soils, so you may still want to hire someone to do the plowing.
Cost of power and machinery is often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer.
If you are going to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the needed machinery investments when you choose among farm enterprises.
You can keep your machinery investment down by buying good secondhand machinery, by sharing the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor, and by hiring someone with machinery to do certain jobs.
If an expensive and specialized piece of machinery is needed -- such as a spray rig, a combine, or a binder -- it is better to pay someone with a machine to do the work.
Selecting a farm before you look for a farm you'll need to know ( 1 ) the kind and scale of farming you want to undertake ; and ( 2 ) whether you want to buy or rent.
Information on pages 8 to 14 may help you in deciding on the kind and scale of your farming venture.
If you are not well acquainted with the area in which you wish to locate, or if you are not sure that you and your family will like and make a success of farming, usually you would do better to rent a place for a year or two before you buy.
Discussed below are some of the main things to look for when you select a part-time farm.
Location nearness to work.
-- choose a location within easy commuting distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunities.
Then if you change jobs you won't necessarily have to sell the farm.
The presence of alternative job opportunities also will make the place easier to sell if that should become desirable.
Obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road.
Nearness to markets.
-- if you grow anything to sell you will need markets nearby.
If you plan to sell fresh vegetables or whole milk, for example, you should be close to a town or city.
Kind of neighborhood.
-- look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept homes.
There are slums in the country as well as in the city.
Few rural areas are protected by zoning.
A tavern, filling station, junk yard, rendering plant, or some other business may go up near enough to hurt your home or to hurt its value.
Facilities in the area.
-- check on the schools in the area, the quality of teaching, and the provision for transportation to and from them.
Find out whether fire protection, sewage system, gas, water mains, and electrical lines are available in the locality.
If these facilities are not at the door, getting them may cost more than you expect.
You may have to provide them yourself or get along without them.
You cannot get along without an adequate supply of pure water.
If you are considering a part-time farm where the water must be provided by a well, find out if there is a good well on the farm or the probable cost of having one drilled.
A pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden.
Pond water can be filtered for human use, but most part-time farmers would not want to go to so much trouble.
The following amounts of water are needed per day for livestock and domestic uses.
Topography and soil is the land suited to the crops you intend to raise?
If you can't tell, get help from your county agricultural agent or other local specialist.
Soil type, drainage, or degree of slope can make the difference between good crops and poor ones.
Small areas that aren't right for a certain crop may lie next to areas that are well suited to that crop.
The house will the house on any part-time farm you are considering make a satisfactory full-time residence?
How much will it cost to do any necessary modernizing and redecorating?
If the house is not wired adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heating system must be installed, check into the cost of making these improvements.
Buying a farm the value of the farm to you will depend on -- its worth as a place to live.
The value of the products you can raise on it.
The possibilities of selling the property later on for suburban subdivision.
Decide first what the place is worth to you and your family as a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town.
Take into account the difference in city and county taxes, insurance rates, utility rates, and the cost of travel to work.
Next, estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm.
To do this, set up a plan on paper for operating the farm.
List the kind and quantity of things the farm can be expected to produce in an average year.
Estimate the value of the produce at normal prices.
The total is the probably gross income from farming.
To find estimated net farm income, subtract estimated annual farming expenditures from probable gross income from farming.
Include as expenditures an allowance for depreciation of farm buildings and equipment.
Also count as an expense a charge for the labor to be contributed by the family.
It may be hard to decide what this labor is worth, but charge something for it.
Otherwise, you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for your labor.
To figure the value of the farm in terms of investment income, divide the estimated annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money were invested in some other way.
Everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate had to be given his day in court as in some vast collective dirge.
For almost two months, the defendant and the world heard from individuals escaped from the grave about fathers and mothers, graybeards, adolescents, babies, starved, beaten to death, strangled, machine-gunned, gassed, burned.
One who had been a boy in Auschwitz had to tell how children had been selected by height for the gas chambers.
The gruesome humor of the Nazis was not forgotten -- the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a Jewish foundation and bearing a copper Star of David -- nor the gratuitous sadism of *j officers.
Public relations strategists everywhere, watching the reaction of the German press, the liberal press, the lunatic-fringe press, listening to their neighbors, studying interviews with men and women on the street, cried out : too much, too much -- the mind of the audience is becoming dulled, the horrors are losing their effect.
And still another witness, one who had crawled out from under a heap of corpses, had to tell how the victims had been forced to lay themselves head to foot one on top of the other before being shot.
Most of this testimony may have been legally admissible as bearing on the corpus delicti of the total Nazi crime but seemed subject to question when not tied to the part in it of the defendant's Department of Jewish Affairs.
Counsel for the defense, however, shrewdly allowing himself to be swept by the current of dreadful recollections, rarely raised an objection.
Would not the emotional catharsis eventually brought on by this awfulness have a calming, if not exhausting, effect likely to improve his client's chances?
Those who feared emotionalism at the Trial showed less understanding than Dr. Servatius of the route by which man achieves the distance necessary for fairness toward enemies.
Interruptions came largely from the bench, which numerous times rebuked the Attorney General for letting his witnesses run on, though it, too, made no serious effort to choke off the flow.
But there was a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the Trial in Jerusalem and those in Moscow and New York.
In each of the last, the trial marked the beginning of a new course : in Moscow the liquidation of the Old Bolsheviks and the tightening of Stalin's dictatorship ; in the United States the initiation of militant anti-*communism, with the repentant ex-*communist in the vanguard.
These trials were properly termed political cases in that the trial itself was a political act producing political consequences.
But what could the Eichmann Trial initiate?
Of what new course could it mark the beginning?
The Eichmann case looked to the past, not to the future.
It was the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection, and of refining the recollection, that will last as long as there are Jews.
As such, it was beyond politics and had no need of justification by a message.
It is not an individual that is in the dock at this historical trial -- said Ben Gurion, and not the Nazi regime alone -- but anti-*semitism throughout history.
How could supplying Eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of Jews without being an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-*semitism?
And if it was not an individual who was in the dock, why was the Trial, as we shall observe later, all but scuttled in the attempt to prove Eichmann a fiend?
These questions touch the root of confusion in the prosecution's case.
It might be contended, of course, that Eichmann in stubbornly denying anti-*semitic feelings was lying or insisting on a private definition of anti-*semitism.
But in either event he was the wrong man for the kind of case outlined by Ben Gurion and set forth in the indictment.
In such a case the defendant should serve as a clear example and not have to be tied to the issue by argument.
One who could be linked to anti-*semitism only by overcoming his objections is scarcely a good specimen of the Jew-baiter throughout the ages.
Shout at Eichmann though he might, the Prosecutor could not establish that the defendant was falsifying the way he felt about Jews or that what he did feel fell into the generally recognized category of anti-*semitism.
Yes, he believed that the Jews were enemies of the Reich, and such a belief is, of course, typical of patriotic anti-*semites ; but he believed in the Jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract, theological way, like a member of a cult speculating on the nature of things.
The real question was how one passed from anti-*semitism of this sort to murder, and the answer to this question is not to be found in anti-*semitism itself.
In regard to Eichmann, it was to be found in the Nazi outlook, which contained a principle separate from and far worse than anti-*semitism, a principle by which the poison of anti-*semitism itself was made more virulent.
Perhaps under the guidance of this Nazi principle one could, as Eichmann declared, feel personally friendly toward the Jews and still be their murderer.
Not through fear of disobeying orders, as Eichmann kept trying to explain, but through a peculiar giddiness that began in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdities contained in the Nazi interpretation of history and grew with each of Hitler's victories into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that was able to respond to any proposal, and the more outrageous the better, well, let's try it.
At any rate, the substance of Eichmann's testimony was that all his actions flowed from his membership in the party and the *j, and though the Prosecutor did his utmost to prove actual personal hatred of Jews, his success on this score was doubtful and the anti-*semitic lesson weakened to that extent.
But if the Trial did not expose the special Nazi mania so deadly to Jews as well as to anyone upon whom it happened to light, neither did it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-*semitism of which the Nazis made such effective use in Germany and wherever else they could find it.
If anti-*semitism was on trial in Jerusalem, why was it not identified, and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press, in its connection with the activities of Eichmann's Department of Jewish Affairs, as exemplified by the betrayal and murder of Jews by non-police and non-party anti-*semites in Germany, as well as in Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary?
The infamous Wansee Conference called by Heydrich in January 1942, to organize the material and technical means to put to death the eleven million Jews spread throughout the nations of Europe, was attended by representatives of major organs of the German state, including the Reich Minister of the Interior, the State Secretary in charge of the Four Year Plan, the Reich Minister of Justice, the Under Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
The measures for annihilation proposed and accepted at the Conference affected industry, transportation, civilian agencies of government.
Heydrich, in opening the Conference, followed the reasoning and even the phraseology of the order issued earlier by Goering which authorized the Final Solution as a complement to previous solutions for eliminating the Jews from German living space through violence, economic strangulation, forced emigration, and evacuation.
In other words, the promulgators of the murder plan made clear that physically exterminating the Jews was but an extension of the anti-*semitic measures already operating in every phase of German life, and that the new conspiracy counted on the general anti-*semitism that had made those measures effective, as a readiness for murder.
This, in fact, it turned out to be.
Since the magnitude of the plan made secrecy impossible, once the wheels had began to turn, persons controlling German industries, social institutions, and armed forces became, through their anti-*semitism or their tolerance of it, conscious accomplices of Hitler's crimes ; whether in the last degree or a lesser one was a matter to be determined individually.
What more could be asked for a Trial intended to warn the world against anti-*semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable Anti-*semite and the concentration-camp brute?
Not in Eichmann's anti-*semitism but in the anti-*semitism of the sober German man of affairs lay the potential warning of the Trial.
No doubt many of the citizens of the Third Reich had conceived their anti-*semitism as an innocent dislike of Jews, as do others like them today.
The Final Solution proved that the Jew-baiter of any variety exposes himself as being implicated in the criminality and madness of others.
Ought not an edifying Trial have made every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by showing how representative types of mere anti-*semites were drawn step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings?
The Prosecutor in his opening remarks did refer to the germ of anti-*semitism among the Germans which Hitler stimulated and transformed.
But if there was evidence at the Trial that aimed over Eichmann's head at his collaborators in the societies where he functioned, the press seems to have missed it.
Nor did the Trial devote much attention to exposing the usefulness of anti-*semitism to the Nazis, both in building their own power and in destroying that of rival organizations and states.
Certainly, one of the best ways of warning the world against anti-*semitism is to demonstrate its workings as a dangerous weapon.
Eichmann himself is a model of how the myth of the enemy-*jew can be used to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all his neighbors.
Do patriots everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the Jews in Germany and later in the occupied countries contributed to terrorizing the populations, splitting apart individuals and groups, arousing the meanest and most dishonest impulses, pulverizing trust and personal dignity, and finally forcing people to follow their masters into the abyss by making them partners in unspeakable crimes?
The career of Eichmann made the Trial a potential showcase for anti-*semitic demoralization : fearful of being mistaken for a Jew, he seeks protection in his Nazi uniform ; clinging to the enemy-*jew idea, he is forced to overcome habits of politeness and neighborliness ; once in power he begins to give vent to a criminal opportunism that causes him to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above him.
Is this the type of citizen you desire?
The Trial should have asked the nations.
But though this characterization in no way diminished Eichmann's guilt, the Prosecutor, more deeply involved in the tactics of a criminal case than a political one, would have none of it.
Finally, if the mission of the Trial was to convict anti-*semitism, how could it have failed to post before the world the contrasting fates of the countries in which the Final Solution was aided by native Jew-haters -- i.e., Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia -- and those in which it met the obstacle of human solidarity -- Denmark, Holland, Italy, Bulgaria, France?
Should not everyone have been awakened to it as an outstanding fact of our time that the nations poisoned by anti-*semitism proved less fortunate in regard to their own freedom than those whose citizens saved their Jewish compatriots from the transports?
Wasn't this meaning of Eichmann's experience in various countries worth highlighting?
As the first collective confrontation of the Nazi outrage, the Trial of Eichmann represents a recovery of the Jews from the shock of the death camps, a recovery that took fifteen years and which is still by no means complete ( though let no one believe that it could be hastened by silence ).
Only across a distance of time could the epic accounting begin.
It is already difficult to recall how little we knew before the Trial of what had been done to the Jews of Europe.
It is not that the facts of the persecution were unavailable ; most of the information elicited in Jerusalem had been brought to the surface by the numerous War Crimes tribunals and investigating commissions, and by reports, memoirs, and survivors' accounts.
In Poughkeepsie, N.*y., in 1952, a Roman Catholic hospital presented seven Protestant physicians with an ultimatum to quit the Planned Parenthood Federation or to resign from the hospital staff.
Three agreed, but four declined and were suspended.
After a flood of protests, they were reinstated at the beginning of 1953.
The peace of the community was badly disturbed, and people across the nation, reading of the incident, felt uneasy.
In New York City in 1958, the city's Commissioner of Hospitals refused to permit a physician to provide a Protestant mother with a contraceptive device.
He thereby precipitated a bitter controversy involving Protestants, Jews and Roman Catholics that continued for two months, until the city's Board of Hospitals lifted the ban on birth-control therapy.
A year later in Albany, N.*y., a Roman Catholic hospital barred an orthopedic surgeon because of his connection with the Planned Parenthood Association.
Immediately, the religious groups of the city were embroiled in an angry dispute over the alleged invasion of a man's right to freedom of religious belief and conscience.
These incidents, typical of many others, dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decades has caused more tension, rancor and strife among religious groups in this country than the birth-control issue.
It has flared up periodically on the front pages of newspapers in communities divided over birth-prevention regulations in municipal hospitals and health and family-welfare agencies.
It has erupted on the national level in the matter of including birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped countries.
Where it is not actually erupting, it rumbles and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano, ready to explode at any moment.
The time has come for citizens of all faiths to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of our nation.
The first step toward the goal is the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level.
Instead of emotional recrimination, loaded phrases and sloganeering, we need a dispassionate study of the facts, a better understanding of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the areas of agreement until a solution is reached.
All too frequently, points out James O'*gara, managing editor of Commonweal, Catholics run roughshod over Protestant sensibilities in this matter, by failure to consider the reasoning behind the Protestant position and, particularly, by their jibes at the fact that Protestant opinion on birth control has changed in recent decades.
All too often our language is unduly harsh.
The second step is to recognize the substantial agreement -- frequently blurred by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper reporting -- already existing between Catholics and Non-*catholics concerning the over-all objectives of family planning.
Instead of Catholics' being obliged or even encouraged to beget the greatest possible number of offspring, as many Non-*catholics imagine, the ideal of responsible parenthood is stressed.
Family planning is encouraged, so that parents will be able to provide properly for their offspring.
Pope Pius 12 declared in 1951 that it is possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of married life, if there are serious reasons, such as those often mentioned in the so-called medical, eugenic, economic and social indications.
This means that such factors as the health of the parents, particularly the mother, their ability to provide their children with the necessities of life, the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of housing facilities may legitimately be taken into consideration in determining the number of offspring.
These are substantially the same factors considered by Non-*catholics in family planning.
The laws of many states permit birth control only for medical reasons.
The Roman Catholic Church, however, sanctions a much more liberal policy on family planning.
Catholics, Protestants and Jews are in agreement over the objectives of family planning, but disagree over the methods to be used.
The Roman Catholic Church sanctions only abstention or the rhythm method, also known as the use of the infertile or safe period.
The Church considers this to be the method provided by nature and its divine Author : it involves no frustration of nature's laws, but simply an intelligent and disciplined use of them.
With the exception of the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Catholic Churches, most churches make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptives, allowing the couple free choice.
There is a difference in theological belief where there seems little chance of agreement.
The grounds for the Church's position are Scriptural ( Old Testament ), the teachings of the fathers and doctors of the early Church, the unbroken tradition of nineteen centuries, the decisions of the highest ecclesiastical authority and the natural law.
The latter plays a prominent role in Roman Catholic theology and is considered decisive, entirely apart from Scripture, in determining the ethical character of birth-prevention methods.
The Roman Catholic natural-law tradition regards as self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act is procreation and that the fostering of the mutual love of the spouses is the secondary and subjective end.
This conclusion is based on two propositions : that man by the use of his reason can ascertain God's purpose in the universe and that God makes known His purpose by certain given physical arrangements.
Thus, man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act is procreation, the propagation of the race.
Moreover, man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangements established by God, who through the law of rhythm has provided a natural method for the control of conception.
Believing that God is the Author of this law and of all laws of nature, Roman Catholics believe that they are obliged to obey those laws, not frustrate or mock them.
Let it be granted then that the theological differences in this area between Protestants and Roman Catholics appear to be irreconcilable.
But people differ in their religious beliefs on scores of doctrines, without taking up arms against those who disagree with them.
Why is it so different in regard to birth control?
It is because each side has sought to implement its distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force its belief, or at least the practical consequences thereof upon others.
It is always a temptation for a religious organization, especially a powerful or dominant one, to impose through the clenched fist of the law its creedal viewpoint upon others.
Both Roman Catholics and Protestants have succumbed to this temptation in the past.
Consider what happened during World War 1, when the Protestant churches united to push the Prohibition law through Congress.
Many of them sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree is intrinsically evil and sinful.
With over four million American men away at war, Protestants forced their distinctive theological belief upon the general public.
With the return of our soldiers, it soon became apparent that the belief was not shared by the great majority of citizens.
The attempt to enforce that belief ushered in a reign of bootleggers, racketeers, hijackers and gangsters that led to a breakdown of law unparalleled in our history.
The so-called noble experiment came to an inglorious end.
That tumultuous, painful and costly experience shows clearly that a law expressing a moral judgment cannot be enforced when it has little correspondence with the general view of society.
That experience holds a lesson for us all in regard to birth control today.
Up to the turn of the century, contraception was condemned by all Christian churches as immoral, unnatural and contrary to divine law.
This was generally reflected in the civil laws of Christian countries.
Today, the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches stand virtually alone in holding that conviction.
The various Lambeth Conferences, expressing the Anglican viewpoint, mirror the gradual change that has taken place among Protestants generally.
In 1920, the Lambeth Conference repeated its 1908 condemnation of contraception and issued an emphatic warning against the use of unnatural means for the avoidance of conception, together with the grave dangers -- physical, moral, and religious -- thereby incurred, and against the evils which the extension of such use threaten the race.
Denouncing the view that the sexual union is an end in itself, the Conference declared : we steadfastly uphold what must always be regarded as the governing considerations of Christian marriage.
One is the primary purpose for which marriage exists, namely, the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of children ; the other is the paramount importance in married life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control.
The Conference called for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptives.
In 1930, the Lambeth Conference again affirmed the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of children, but conceded that, in certain limited circumstances, contraception might be morally legitimate.
In 1958, the Conference endorsed birth control as the responsibility laid by God on parents everywhere.
Many other Protestant denominations preceded the Anglicans in such action.
In March, 1931, 22 out of 28 members of a committee of the Federal Council of Churches ratified artificial methods of birth control.
As to the necessity, the committee declared, for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the spacing of children, and consequently of control of conception, there can be no question.
There is general agreement also that sex union between husbands and wives as an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation is right.
Since then, many Protestant denominations have made separate pronouncements, in which they not only approved birth control, but declared it at times to be a religious duty.
What determines the morality, they state, is not the means used, but the motive in general, the means ( excluding abortion ) that prove most effective are considered the most ethical.
This development is reflected in the action taken in February, 1961, by the general board of the National Council of Churches, the largest Protestant organization in the *j.
The board approved and commended the use of birth-control devices as a part of Christian responsibility in family planning.
It called for opposition to laws and institutional practices restricting the information or availability of contraceptives.
The general board declared : most of the Protestant churches hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motives are right.
The general Protestant conviction is that motives, rather than methods, form the primary moral issue, provided the methods are limited to the prevention of conception.
An action once universally condemned by all Christian churches and forbidden by the civil law is now not only approved by the overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations, but also deemed, at certain times, to be a positive religious duty.
This viewpoint has now been translated into action by the majority of people in this country.
Repeated polls have disclosed that most married couples are now using contraceptives in the practice of birth control.
For all concerned with social-welfare legislation, the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the thought and habits of the vast majority of the American people is clear, profound and far-reaching.
To try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that was occasioned by the ill-starred Prohibition experiment.
This brings us to the fact that the realities we are dealing with lie not in the field of civil legislation, but in the realm of conscience and religion : they are moral judgments and matters of theological belief.
Conscience and religion are concerned with private sin : the civil law is concerned with public crimes.
Only confusion, failure and anarchy result when the effort is made to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of policing private homes to preclude the possibility of sin.
Among the chief victims of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself.
On April 17, 1610, the sturdy little three-masted bark, Discovery, weighed anchor in St. Katherine's Pool, London, and floated down the Thames toward the sea.
She carried, besides her captain, a crew of twenty-one and provisions for a voyage of exploration of the Arctic waters of North America.
Seventeen months later, on September 6, 1611, an Irish fishing boat sighted the Discovery limping eastward outside Galway Bay.
When she reached port, she was found to have on board only eight men, all near starvation.
The captain was gone, and the mate was gone.
The man who now commanded her had started the voyage as an ordinary seaman.
What disaster struck the Discovery during those seventeen months?
What happened to the fourteen missing men?
These questions have remained one of the great sea mysteries of all time.
For hundreds of years, the evidence available consisted of ( 1 ) the captain's fragmentary journal, ( 2 ) a highly prejudiced account by one of the survivors, ( 3 ) a note found in a dead man's desk on board, and ( 4 ) several second-hand reports.
All told, they offered a highly confused picture.
But since 1927, researchers digging into ancient court records and legal files have been able to find illuminating pieces of information.
Not enough to do away with all doubts, but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the events of the voyage.
Historians have had two reasons for persisting so long in their investigations.
First, they wanted to clarify a tantalizing, bizarre enigma.
Second, they believed it important to determine the fate of the captain -- a man whose name is permanently stamped on our maps, on American towns and counties, on a great American river, and on half a million square miles of Arctic seas.
The name : Henry Hudson.
This is the story of his last tragic voyage, as nearly as we are able -- or ever, probably, will be able -- to determine : the sailing in the spring of 1610 was Hudson's fourth in four years.
Each time his objective had been the same -- a direct water passage from Western Europe to the Far East.
In 1607 and 1608, the English Muscovy Company had sent him northward to look for a route over the North Pole or across the top of Russia.
Twice he had failed, and the Muscovy Company indicated it would not back him again.
In 1609, the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson, gave him two learned geographers, fitted him out with a ship called the Half Moon, and supplied him with Dutch sailors.
This time he turned westward, to the middle Atlantic coast of North America.
His chief discovery was important -- the Great North ( later, the Hudson ) River -- but it produced no northwest passage.
When the Half Moon put in at Dartmouth, England, in the fall of 1609, word of Hudson's findings leaked out, and English interest in him revived.
The government forbade Hudson to return to Amsterdam with his ship.
He thereupon went to London and spent the winter talking to men of wealth.
By springtime, he was supported by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of Henry, Prince of Wales.
He had obtained and provisioned a veteran ship called the Discovery and had recruited a crew of twenty-one, the largest he had ever commanded.
The purpose of this fourth voyage was clear.
A century of exploration had established that a great land mass, North and South America, lay between Europe and the Indies.
One by one, the openings in the coast that promised a passage through had been explored and discarded.
In fact, Hudson's sail up the Great North River had disposed of one of the last hopes.
But there remained one mysterious, unexplored gap, far to the north.
Nearly twenty-five years before, Captain John Davis had noted, as he sailed near the Arctic Circle, a very great gulf, the water whirling and roaring, as it were the meeting of tides.
He named this opening, between Baffin Island and Labrador, the Furious Overfall.
( later, it was to be called Hudson Strait.
) in 1602, George Waymouth, in the same little Discovery that Hudson now commanded, had sailed 300 miles up the strait before his frightened men turned the ship back.
Hudson now proposed to sail all the way through and test the seas beyond for the long-sought waterway.
Even Hudson, experienced in Arctic sailing and determined as he was, must have had qualms as he slid down the Thames.
Ahead were perilous, ice-filled waters.
On previous voyages, it had been in precisely such dangerous situations that he had failed as a leader and captain.
On the second voyage, he had turned back at the frozen island of Novaya Zemlya and meekly given the crew a certificate stating that he did so of his own free will -- which was obviously not the case.
On the third voyage, a near-mutiny rising from a quarrel between Dutch and English crew members on the Half Moon had almost forced him to head the ship back to Amsterdam in Mid-*atlantic.
Worse, his present crew included five men who had sailed with him before.
Of only one could he be sure -- young John Hudson, his second son.
The mate, Robert Juet, who had kept the journal on the Half Moon, was experienced -- but he was a bitter old man, ready to complain or desert at any opportunity.
Philip Staffe, the ship's carpenter, was a good worker, but perversely independent.
Arnold Lodley and Michael Perse were like the rest -- lukewarm, ready to swing against Hudson in a crisis.
But men willing to sail at all into waters where wooden ships could be crushed like eggs were hard to find.
Hudson knew he had to use these men as long as he remained an explorer.
And he refused to be anything else.
It is believed that Hudson was related to other seafaring men of the Muscovy Company and was trained on company ships.
He was a Londoner, married, with three sons.
( the common misconception that he was Dutch and that his first name was Hendrik stem from Dutch documents of his third voyage.
) in 1610, Hudson was probably in his early forties, a good navigator, a stubborn voyager, but otherwise fatally unsuited to his chosen profession.
Hudson's first error of the fourth voyage occurred only a few miles down the Thames.
There at the river's edge waited one Henry Greene, whom Hudson listed as a clerk.
Greene was in actuality a young ruffian from Kent, who had broken with his parents in order to keep the company he preferred -- pimps, panders and whores.
He was not the sort of sailor Hudson wanted his backers to see on board and he had Greene wait at Gravesend, where the Discovery picked him up.
For the first three weeks, the ship skirted up the east coast of Great Britain, then turned westward.
On May 11, she reached Iceland.
Poor winds and fog locked her up in a harbor the crew called Lousie Bay.
The subsequent two-weeks wait made the crew quarrelsome.
With Hudson looking on, his protege Greene picked a fight with the ship's surgeon, Edward Wilson.
The issue was settled on shore, Greene winning and Wilson remaining ashore, determined to catch the next fishing boat back to England.
With difficulty, Hudson persuaded him to rejoin the ship, and they sailed from Iceland.
Early in June, the Discovery passed Desolation ( southern Greenland ) and in mid-*june entered the Furious Overfall.
Floating ice bore down from the north and west.
Fog hung over the route constantly.
Turbulent tides rose as much as fifty feet.
The ship's compass was useless because of the nearness of the magnetic North Pole.
As the bergs grew larger, Hudson was forced to turn south into what is now Ungava Bay, an inlet of the Great Strait.
After finding that its coasts led nowhere, however, he turned north again, toward the main, ice-filled passageway -- and the crew, at first uneasy, then frightened, rebelled.
The trouble was at least partly Juet's doing.
For weeks he had been saying that Hudson's idea of sailing through to Java was absurd.
The great, crushing ice masses coming into view made him sound like the voice of pure reason.
A group of sailors announced to Hudson that they would sail no farther.
Instead of quelling the dissension, as many captains of the era would have done ( Sir Francis Drake lopped a man's head off under similar circumstances ), Hudson decided to be reasonable.
He went to his cabin and emerged carrying a large chart, which he set up in view of the crew.
Patiently, he explained what he knew about their course and their objectives.
When Hudson had finished, the town meeting broke down into a general, wordy argument.
One man remarked that if he had a hundred pounds, he would give ninety of them to be back in England.
Up spoke carpenter Staffe, who said he wouldn't give ten pounds to be home.
The statement was effective.
The meeting broke up.
Hudson was free to sail on.
All through July the Discovery picked her way along the 450-mile-long strait, avoiding ice and rocky islands.
On August 3, two massive headlands reared out of the mists -- great gateways never before, so far as Hudson knew, seen by Europeans.
To starboard was a cape a thousand feet high, patched with ice and snow, populated by thousands of screaming sea birds.
To port was a point 200 feet high rising behind to a precipice of 2,000 feet.
Hudson named the capes Digges and Wolstenholme, for two of his backers.
Hudson pointed the Discovery down the east coast of the newly discovered sea ( now called Hudson Bay ), confident he was on his way to the warm waters of the Pacific.
After three weeks' swift sailing, however, the ship entered an area of shallow marshes and river deltas.
The ship halted.
The great sea to the westwards was a dead end.
This must have been Hudson's blackest discovery.
For he seemed to sense at once that before him was no South Sea, but the solid bulk of the North American continent.
This was the bitter end, and Hudson seemed to know he was destined to failure.
Feverishly, he tried to brush away this intuition.
North and south, east and west, back and forth he sailed in the land-locked bay, plowing furiously forward until land appeared, then turning to repeat the process, day after day, week after week.
Hundreds of miles to the north, the route back to England through the Furious Overfall was again filling with ice.
The men were at first puzzled, then angered by the aimless tacking.
Once more, Juet's complaints were the loudest.
Hudson's reply was to accuse the mate of disloyalty.
Juet demanded that Hudson prove his charges in an open trial.
The trial was held September 10.
Hudson, presiding, heard Juet's defense, then called for testimony from crew members.
Juet had made plentiful enemies, several men stepped forward.
Hands on Bible, seaman Lodley and carpenter Staffe swore that Juet had tried to persuade them to keep muskets and swords in their cabins.
Cook Bennett Mathues said Juet had predicted bloodshed on the ship.
Others added that Juet had wanted to turn the ship homeward.
Hudson deposed Juet and cut his pay.
The new mate was Robert Bylot, talented but inexperienced.
There were other shifts and pay cuts according to the way individuals had conducted themselves.
The important result, however, was that Juet and Francis Clemens, the deposed boatswain, became Hudson's sworn enemies.
As Hudson resumed his desperate criss-crossing of the little bay, every incident lessened the crew's respect for him.
Once, after the Discovery lay for a week in rough weather, Hudson ordered the anchor raised before the sea had calmed.
Just as it was being hauled inboard, a sea hit the ship.
Michael Butt and Adame Moore were thrown off the capstan and badly injured.
The anchor cable would have been lost overboard, but Philip Staffe was on hand to sever it with his axe.
Thomas Douglas, fifth Earl of Selkirk, a noble humanitarian Scot concerned with the plight of the crofters of his native Highlands, conceived a plan to settle them in the valley of the Red River of the North.
Since the land he desired lay within the great northern empire of the Hudson's Bay Company, he purchased great blocks of the Comany's stock with the view to controlling its policies.
Having achieved this end, he was able to buy 116,000 square miles in the valleys of the Red and Assiniboine rivers.
The grant, which stretched southward to Lake Traverse -- the headwaters of the Red -- was made in May, 1811, and by October of that year a small group of Scots was settling for the winter at York Factory on Hudson Bay.
Thus at the same time that William Henry Harrison was preparing to pacify the aborigines of Indiana Territory and winning fame at the battle of Tippecanoe, Anglo-*saxon settlement made a great leap into the center of the North American continent to the west of the American agricultural frontier.
Seven hundred miles south of York Factory, at the Forks of the Red and the Assiniboine, twenty-three men located a settlement in August 1812.
By October the little colony about Fort Douglas ( present-day Winnipeg ) numbered 100.
Within a few years the Scots, engaged in breaking the thick sod and stirring the rich soil of the valley, were joined by a group called Meurons.
The latter, members of two regiments of Swiss mercenaries transported by Great Britain to Canada to fight the Americans in the War of 1812, had settled in Montreal and Kingston at the close of the war in 1815.
Selkirk persuaded eighty men and four officers to go to Red River where they were to serve as a military force to protect his settlers from the hostile Northwest Company which resented the intrusion of farmers into the fur traders' empire.
The mercenaries were little interested in farming and added nothing to the output of the farm plots on which all work was still done with hoes as late as 1818.
It was the low yield of the Selkirk plots and the ravages of grasshoppers in 1818 that led to the dispersal of the settlement southward.
When late in the summer the full extent of the damage was assessed, all but fifty of the Scots, Swiss and metis moved up the Red to the mouth of the Pembina river.
Here they built huts and a stockade named Fort Daer after Selkirk's barony in Scotland.
The new site was somewhat warmer than Fort Douglas and much closer to the great herds of buffalo on which the settlement must depend for food.
The Selkirk settlers had been anticipated in their move southward by British fur traders.
For many years the Northwest Company had its southern headquarters at Prairie Du Chien on the Mississippi River, some 300 miles southeast of present-day St. Paul, Minnesota.
When in 1816 an act of Congress forced the foreign firm out of the United States, its British-born employees, now become American citizens -- Joseph Rolette, Joseph Renville and Alexis Bailly -- continued in the fur business.
On Big Stone Lake near the headwaters of the Red River, Robert Dickson, Superintendent of the Western Indian Department of Canada, had a trading post and planned in 1818 to build a fort to be defended by twenty men and two small artillery pieces.
His trading goods came from Canada to the Forks of Red River and from Selkirk's settlement he brought them south in carts.
These carts were of a type devised in Pembina in the days of Alexander Henry the Younger about a decade before the Selkirk colony was begun.
In 1802 Henry referred to our new carts as being about four feet off the ground and carrying five times as much as a horse could pack.
They were held together by pegs and withes and in later times drawn by a single ox in thills.
It was Dickson who suggested to Lord Selkirk that he return to the Atlantic coast by way of the United States.
In September 1817 at Fort Daer ( Pembina ) Dickson met the noble lord whom, with the help of a band of Sioux, he escorted to Prairie Du Chien.
During the trip Selkirk decided that the route through Illinois territory to Indiana and the eastern United States was the best route for goods from England to reach Red River and that the United States was a better source of supply for many goods than either Canada or England.
Upon arriving at Baltimore, Selkirk on December 22 wrote to John Quincy Adams, Secretary of State at Washington, inquiring about laws covering trade with Missouri and Illinois Territories.
This traffic, he declared prophetically, tho' it might be of small account at first, would increase with the progress of our Settlements.
The route which he had traveled and which he believed might develop into a trade route was followed by his settlers earlier than he might have expected.
In 1819 grasshoppers again destroyed the crop at the Forks ( Fort Douglas ) and in December 1819, twenty men left Fort Daer for the most northerly American outpost at Prairie Du Chien.
It was a three-month journey in the dead of winter followed by three months of labor on Mackinac boats.
With these completed and ice gone from the St. Peter's River ( present-day Minnesota river ) their 250 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels of oats and barley and 30 bushels of peas and some chickens were loaded onto the flat-bottomed boats and rowed up the river to Big Stone Lake, across into Lake Traverse, and down the Red.
They reached Fort Douglas in June 1820.
This epic effort to secure seed for the colony cost Selkirk *b1, 040.
Nevertheless so short was the supply of seed that the settlers were forced to retreat to Fort Daer for food.
Thereafter seed and food became more plentiful and the colony remained in the north the year round.
Activity by British traders and the presence of a colony on the Red prompted the United State War Department in 1819 to send Lieutenant-*colonel Henry Leavenworth from Detroit to put a post 300 miles northwest of Prairie Du Chien, until then the most advanced United States post.
In September 1822 two companies of infantry arrived at the mouth of the St. Peter's River, the head of navigation on the Mississippi, and began construction of Fort St. Anthony which, upon completion, was renamed in honor of its commander, Colonel Josiah Snelling.
It was from the American outposts that Red River shortages of livestock were to be made good.
Hercules L. Dousman, fur trader and merchant at Prairie Du Chien, contracted to supply Selkirk's people with some 300 head of cattle, and Alexis Bailly and Francois Labothe were hired as drovers.
Bailly, after leaving Fort Snelling in August 1821, was forced to leave some of the cattle at the Hudson's Bay Company's post on Lake Traverse in the Sieux Country and reached Fort Garry, as the Selkirk Hudson's Bay Company center was now called, late in the fall.
He set out on his 700-mile return journey with five families of discontented and disappointed Swiss who turned their eyes toward the United States.
Observing their distressing condition, Colonel Snelling allowed these half-starved immigrants to settle on the military reservation.
As these Swiss were moving from the Selkirk settlement to become the first civilian residents of Minnesota, Dousman of Michilimackinac, Michigan, and Prairie Du Chien was traveling to Red River to open a trade in merchandise.
Early in 1822 he was at Fort Garry offering to bring in pork, flour, liquor and tobacco.
Alexander Mc*donnell, governor of Red River, and James Bird, a chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company, ordered such sundry articles to a value of *b4, 500.
For its part the Hudson's Bay Company was troubled by the approach of American settlement.
As the time drew near for the drawing of the British-*american frontier by terms of the agreement of 1818, the company suspected that the Pembina colony -- its own post and Fort Daer -- was on American territory.
Accordingly Selkirk's agents ordered the settlers to move north, and by October, John Halkett had torn down both posts, floating the timber to the Forks in rafts.
I have done everything, he wrote, to break up the whole of that unfortunate establishment.
Despite Company threats, duly carried through, to cut off supplies of powder, ball, and thread for fishing nets, about 350 persons stayed in the village.
They would attempt to bring supplies from St. Louis or Prairie Du Chien at great expense as well as danger.
At Fort Garry some of the Swiss also decided to cast their lot with the United States, and in 1823 several families paid guides to take them to Fort Snelling.
The disasters of 1825-1826 caused more to leave.
After heavy rains and an onslaught of mice, snow fell on October 15, 1825, and remained on the ground through a winter so cold that the ice on the Red was five feet thick.
In April came a rapid thaw that produced high waters which did not recede until mid-*june.
On June 24 more than 400 families started the three-month trip across the plains to the Mississippi.
By fall, 443 survivors of this arduous journey were clustered about Fort Snelling, but most of them were sent on to Galena and St. Louis, with a few going as far as Vevay, Indiana, a notable Swiss center in the United States.
In 1837,157 Red River people with more than 200 cattle were living on the reservation at Fort Snelling.
Below the fort, high bluffs extended uninterruptedly for six miles along the Mississippi River.
At the point where they ended, another settlement grew up around a chapel built at the boat landing by Father Lucian Galtier in 1840.
Its people, including Pierre Bottineau and other American Fur Company employees and the refugees from Fort Garry, were joined by the remaining Scots and Swiss from Fort Snelling when Major Joseph Plympton expelled them from the reservation in May 1840.
The resultant town, platted in 1847 and named for the patron of Father Galtier's mission, St. Paul, was to become an important center of the fur trade and was to take on a new interest for those Selkirkers who remained at Red River.
While population at Fort Garry increased rapidly, from 2,417 in 1831 to 4,369 in 1840, economic opportunities did not increase at a similar rate.
Accordingly, though the practice violated the no-trading provision of the Selkirk charter which reserved all such activity in merchandise and furs to the Hudson's Bay Company, some settlers went into trade.
The Company maintained a store at which products of England could be purchased and brought in goods for the new merchants on the understanding that they refrain from trading in furs.
Despite this prohibiton, by 1844 some of the Fort Garry merchants were trading with the Indians for furs.
In June 1845, the Governor and Council of Assiniboia imposed a 20 per cent duty on imports via Hudson's Bay which were viewed as aimed at the very vitals of the Company's trade and power.
To reduce further the flow of goods from England, the Company's local officials asked that its London authorities refrain from forwarding any more trade goods to these men.
With their customary source of supply cut off, the Fort Garry free traders engaged three men to cart goods to them from the Mississippi country.
Others carried pemmican from the Forks to St. Paul and goods from St. Paul to Red River, as in the summer of 1847 when one trader, Wells, transported twenty barrels of whisky to the British settlement.
This trade was subject to a tariff of 7.5 per cent after February 1835, but much was smuggled into Assiniboia with the result that the duty was reduced by 1841 to 4 per cent on the initiative of the London committee.
The trade in a few commodities noted above was to grow in volume as a result of changes both north and south of the 49th parallel.
The letters of the common soldiers are rich in humor.
Indeed, no richer humor is to be found in the whole of American literature than in the letters of the semi-literate men who wore the blue and the gray.
Some of their figures of speech were colorful and expressive.
A Confederate observed that the Yankees were : thicker than lise on a hen and a dam site ornraier.
Another reported that his comrades were in fine spirits pitching around like a blind dog in a meat house.
A third wrote that it was raining like poring peas on a rawhide.
Yanks were equally adept at figurative expression.
One wrote : ( I am so hungry ) I could eat a rider off his horse & snap at the stirups.
A second reported that the dilapidated houses in Virginia look like the latter end of original sin and hard times.
A third remarked of slowness of Southerners : they moved about from corner to corner, as uneasy as a litter of hungry leaches on the neck of a wooden god.
Still another, annoyed by the brevity of a recently received missive, wrote : yore letter was short and sweet, jist like a roasted maget.
A Yankee sergeant gave the following description of his sweetheart : my girl is none of your one-horse girls.
She is a regular stub and twister, double geered.
She is well-educated and refined, all wildcat and fur, and Union from the muzzle to the crupper.
Humor found many modes of expression.
A Texan wrote to a male companion at home : what has become of Halda and Laura?
When you see them again give them my love -- not best respects now, but love by God.
William R. Stillwell, an admirable Georgian whose delightful correspondence is preserved in the Georgia Department of Archives and History, liked to tease his wife in his letters.
After he had been away from home about a year he wrote : ( dear Wife ) if I did not write and receive letters from you I believe that I would forgit that I was married.
I don't feel much like a maryed man but I never forgit it sofar as to court enny other lady but if I should you must forgive me as I am so forgitful.
A Yank, disturbed by his increasing corpulence, wrote : I am growing so fat I am a burden 2 myself.
Another Yank parodied the familiar bedtime prayer : now I lay me down to sleep, the gray-backs o'er my body creep ; if they should bite before I wake, I pray the Lord their jaws to break.
Charles Thiot, a splendid Georgia soldier, differed from most of his comrades in the ranks in that he was the owner of a large plantation, well-educated, and nearly fifty years of age.
But he was very much like his associates in his hatred of camp routine.
Near the end of his service he wrote that when the war was over he was going to buy two pups, name one of them Fall-in and the other Close-up, and then shoot them both, and that will be the end of Fall-in and Close-up.
The soldiers who comprised the rank and file of the Civil War armies were an earthy people.
They talked and wrote much about the elemental functions of the body.
One of the most common of camp maladies was diarrhoea.
Men of more delicate sensibilities referred to this condition as looseness of the bowels ; but a much more common designation was the sh-ts.
A Michigan soldier stationed in Georgia wrote in 1864 : I expect to be tough as a knott as soon as I get over the Georgia Shitts.
Johnny Rebs from the deep South who were plagued with diarrhoea after transfer to the Virginia front often informed their families that they were suffering from the the Virginia quickstep.
A Georgia soldier gave his wife the following description of the cause and consequence of diarrhoea : I have bin a little sick with diorah two or three days.
I eat too much eggs and poark.
It sowered ( on ) my stomack and turn loose on me.
A Michigan soldier wrote his brother : I am well at present with the exception I have got the Dyerear and I hope thease few lines find you the same.
The letters which poured forth from camps were usually written under adverse circumstances.
Save for brief periods in garrison or winter quarters, soldiers rarely enjoyed the luxury of a writing desk or table.
Most of the letters were written in the hubbub of camp, on stumps, pieces of bark, drum heads, or the knee.
In the South, after the first year of the war, paper and ink were very poor.
Scarcity of paper caused many Southerners to adopt the practice of cross-writing, i.e., after writing from left to right of the page in the usual manner, they gave the sheet a half turn and wrote from end to end across the lines previously written.
Sometimes soldiers wrote letters while bullets were whizzing about their heads.
A Yank writing from Vicksburg, May 28, 1863, stated : not less than 50 balls have passed over me since I commenced writing.
I could tell you of plenty narrow escapes, but we take no notice of them now.
A Reb stationed near Petersburg informed his mother : I need not tell you that I dodge pretty often for you can see that very plainly by the blots in this letter.
Just count each blot a dodge and add in a few for I don't dodge every time.
Another Reb writing under similar circumstances before Atlanta reported : the Yankees keep shooting so I am afraid they will knock over my ink, so I will close.
3 the most common type of letter was that of soldier husbands to their wives.
But fathers often addressed communications to their small children ; and these, full of homely advice, are among the most human and revealing of Civil War letters.
Rebs who owned slaves occasionally would include in their letters admonitions or greetings to members of the Negro community.
Occasionally they would write to the slaves.
Early in the war it was not uncommon for planters' sons to retain in camp Negro body servants to perform the menial chores such as cooking, foraging, cleaning the quarters, shining shoes, and laundering clothes.
Sometimes these servants wrote or dictated for enclosure with the letters of their soldier-masters messages to their relatives and to members of their owners' families.
Unmarried soldiers carried on correspondence with sweethearts at home.
Owing to the restrained usages characteristic of 19th-century America, these letters usually were stereotyped and revealed little depth of feeling.
Occasionally gay young blades would write vividly to boon companions at home about their amorous exploits in Richmond, Petersburg, Washington, or Nashville.
But these comments are hardly printable.
An Alabama soldier whose feminine associations were of the more admirable type wrote boastfully of his achievements among the Virginia belles : they thout I was a saint.
I told them some sweet lies and they believed it all.
I would tell them I got a letter from home stating that five of my Negroes had runaway and ten of Pappy's.
But I wold say I recond he did not mind it for he had a plenty more left and then they would lean to me like a sore eyd kitten to a basin of milk.
Some of the letters were pungently expressive.
An Ohio soldier who, from a comrade just returned from leave, received an unfavorable comment on the conduct of his sister, took pen in hand and delivered himself thus : dear Sis.
Alf sed he heard that you and Hardy was runing together all the time and he though he wod gust quit having any thing mor to doo with you for he thought it was no more yuse.
I think you made a dam good chouise to turn off as nise a feler as Alf Dyer and let that orney thefin, drunkard, damed card playing sun of a bich com to sea you, the god damed theaf and lop yeard pigen tode helion, he is too orney for hel.
I will shute him as shore as I sea him.
Initiation into combat sometimes elicited from soldier correspondents choice comments about their experiences and reactions.
A Federal infantryman wrote to his father shortly after his first skirmish in Virginia : dear Pa.
Went out skouting yesterday.
We got to one house where there were five secessionists.
They brok & run and Arch holored out to shoot the ornery suns of biches and we all let go at them.
Thay may say what they please but godamit Pa it is fun.
Some of the choicest remarks made by soldiers in their letters were in disparagement of unpopular officers.
A Mississippi soldier wrote : our General Reub Davis is a vain, stuck-up, illiterate ass.
An Alabamian wrote : Col. Henry is ( an ignoramus ) fit for nothing higher than the cultivation of corn.
A Floridian stated that his officers were not fit to tote guts to a bear.
On December 9, 1862, Sergeant Edwin H. Fay, an unusual Louisianan who held A.*b. and M.*a. degrees from Harvard University and who before the war was headmaster of a private school for boys in Louisiana, wrote his wife : I saw Pemberton and he is the most insignificant puke I ever saw.
His head cannot contain enough sense to command a regiment, much less a corps.
Jackson runs first and his Cavalry are well drilled to follow their leader.
He is not worth shucks.
But he is a West Point graduate and therefore must be born to command.
Similar comments about officers are to be found in the letters of Northern soldiers.
A Massachusetts soldier, who seems to have been a Civil War version of Bill Mauldin, wrote : the officers consider themselves as made of a different material from the low fellows in the ranks.
They get all the glory and most of the pay and don't earn ten cents apiece on the average, the drunken rascals.
Private George Gray Hunter of Pennsylvania wrote : I am well convinced in my own mind that had it not been for officers this war would have ended long ago.
Another Yankee became so disgusted as to state : I wish to God one half of our officers were knocked in the head by slinging them against ( the other half ).
No group of officers came in for more spirited denunciation than the doctors.
One Federal soldier wrote : the docters is no aconte -- hell will be filde with do(c)ters and offersey when this war is over.
Shortly after the beginning of Sherman's Georgia campaign, an ailing Yank wrote his homefolk : the surgeon insisted on sending me to the hospital for treatment.
I insisted on takeing the field and prevailed -- thinking that I had better die by rebel bullets than ( by ) Union quackery.
The attitudes which the Rebs and Yanks took toward each other were very much the same and ranged over the same gamut of feeling, from friendliness to extreme hatred.
The Rebs were, to a Massachusetts corporal, fighting madmen or not men at all but whiskey & gunpowder put into a human frame.
A Pennsylvania soldier wrote that they were the hardest looking set of men that ever I saw.
They looked as if they had been fed on vinegar and shavings.
Private Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Wisconsin Light Artillery wrote in his diary : I strolled among the Alabamans on the right, found some of the greenest specimens of humanity I think in the universe, their ignorance being little less than the slave they despise with as imperfect a dialect.
They recooned as how you'uns all would be a heap wus to we'uns all.
In a similar vein, but writing from the opposite side, Thomas Taylor, a private in the 6th Alabama Volunteers, in a letter to his wife, stated : you know that my heart is with you but I never could have been satisfied to have staid at home when my country is invaded by a thievin foe, by a set of cowardly skunks whose motto is Booty.
The popularity of folklore in America stands in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in America.
And the emphasis on nationalism in America is in proportion to the growth of American influence across the world.
Thus, if we are to observe American folklore in the twentieth century, we will do well to establish the relationships between folklore, nationalism and imperialism at the outset.
Historians have come to recognize two cardinal facts concerning nationalism and international influence.
1 ) every age rewrites the events of its history in terms of what should have been, creating legends about itself that rationalize contemporary beliefs and excuse contemporary actions.
What actually occurred in the past is seldom as important as what a given generation feels must have occurred.
2 ) as a country superimposes its cultural and political attitudes on others, it searches its heritage in hopes of justifying its aggressiveness.
Its folklore and legend, usually disguised as history, are allowed to account for group actions, to provide a focal point for group loyalty, and to become a cohesive force for national identification.
One can apply these facts to Britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries as she spread her dominion over palm and pine, and they can be applied again to the United States in more recent years.
The popularity of local color literature before the Spanish-*american War, the steady currency of the Lincoln myth, the increased emphasis on the frontier West in our mass media are cases in point.
Nor is it an accident that baseball, growing into the national game in the last 75 years, has become a microcosm of American life, that learned societies such as the American Folklore Society and the American Historical Association were founded in the 1880s, or that courses in American literature, American civilization, American anything have swept our school and college curricula.
Of course, nationalism has really outlived its usefulness in a country as world-oriented as ours, and its continued existence reflects one of the major culture lags of the twentieth-century United States.
Yet nationalism has lost few of its charms for the historian, writer or man in the street.
It is an understandable paradox that most American history and most American literature is today written from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time America is spreading her dominion over palm and pine.
After all, the average American as he lies and waits for the enemy in Korea or as she scans the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front is unconcerned that his or her plight is the result of a complex of personal, economic and governmental actions far beyond the normal citizen's comprehension and control.
Anyone's identification with an international struggle, whether warlike or peaceful, requires absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement.
Such identification comes for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and developing appropriate national heroes.
In America, such self-deception has served a particularly useful purpose.
A heterogeneous people have needed it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land.
But we must never forget, most of the appropriate heroes and their legends were created overnight, to answer immediate needs, almost always with conscious aims and ends.
Parson Weems's George Washington became the symbol of honesty and the father image of the uniting States.
Abraham Lincoln emerged as an incarnation of the national Constitution.
Robert E. Lee represented the dignity needed by a rebelling confederacy.
And their roles are paralleled by those of Patrick Henry, Nathan Hale, Andrew Jackson, Davy Crockett, Theodore Roosevelt and many, many more.
Therefore, the scholar, as he looks at our national folklore of the last 60 years, will be mindful of two facts.
1 ) most of the legends that are created to fan the fires of patriotism are essentially propagandistic and are not folk legends at all.
2 ) the concept that an American national folklore exists is itself probably another propagandistic legend.
Folklore is individually created art that a homogeneous group of people preserve, vary and recreate through oral transmission.
It has come to mean myths, legends, tales, songs, proverbs, riddles, superstitions, rhymes and such literary forms of expression.
Related to written literature, and often remaining temporarily frozen in written form, it loses its vitality when transcribed or removed from its oral existence.
Though it may exist in either literate or illiterate societies, it assumes a role of true cultural importance only in the latter.
In its propagandistic and commercial haste to discover our folk heritage, the public has remained ignorant of definitions such as this.
Enthusiastically, Americans have swept subliterary and bogus materials like Paul Bunyan tales, Abe Lincoln anecdotes and labor union songs up as true products of our American oral tradition.
Nor have we remembered that in the melting pot of America the hundreds of isolated and semi-isolated ethnic, regional and occupational groups did not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization had caused them to cast oral tradition aside as a means of carrying culturally significant material.
Naturally, such scholarly facts are of little concern to the man trying to make money or fan patriotism by means of folklore.
That much of what he calls folklore is the result of beliefs carefully sown among the people with the conscious aim of producing a desired mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situations is irrelevant.
As long as his material is Americana, can in some way be ascribed to the masses and appears democratic to his audience, he remains satisfied.
From all this we can now see that two streams of development run through the history of twentieth-century American folklore.
On the one side we have the university professors and their students, trained in Teutonic methods of research, who have sought out, collected and studied the true products of the oral traditions of the ethnic, regional and occupational groups that make up this nation.
On the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalists who have been willing to use any patriotic, frontier western or colonial material willy-nilly.
Unfortunately, few of the artists ( writers, movie producers, dramatists and musicians ) who have used American folklore since 1900 have known enough to distinguish between the two streams even in the most general of ways.
After all, the field is large, difficult to define and seldom taught properly to American undergraduates.
In addition, this country has been settled by many peoples of many heritages and their lore has become acculturated slowly, in an age of print and easy communication, within an ever-expanding and changing society.
The problems confuse even the experts.
For that matter, the experts themselves are a mixed breed.
Anthropologists, housewives, historians and such by profession, they approach their discipline as amateurs, collectors, commercial propagandists, analysts or some combination of the four.
They have widely varying backgrounds and aims.
They have little esprit de corps.
The outlook for the amateur, for instance, is usually dependent on his fondness for local history or for the picturesque.
His love of folklore has romanticism in it, and he doesn't care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote.
Folklore is his hobby, and he, all too rightly, wishes it to remain as such.
The amateur is closely related to the collector, who is actually no more than the amateur who has taken to the field.
The collector enjoys the contact with rural life ; he hunts folklore for the very field and stream reasons that many persons hunt game ; and only rarely is he acutely concerned with the meaning of what he has located.
Fundamentally, both these types, the amateur and the collector, are uncritical and many of them don't distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material.
But there are also the commercial propagandists and the analysts -- one dominated by money, the other by nineteenth-century German scholarship.
Both are primarily concerned with the uses that can be made of the material that the collector has found.
Both shudder at the thought of proceeding too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light lines.
The commercial propagandist, who can't afford to be critical, gets along well with the amateur, from whom he feeds, but he frequently steps on the analyst's toes by refusing to keep his material genuine.
His standards are, of course, completely foreign to those of the analyst.
To both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lacks a soul, lacks appreciation with his endless probings and classifications.
Dominated by the vicious circle of the university promotion system, the analyst looks down on and gets along poorly with the other three groups, although he cannot deny his debt to the collector.
The knowledge that most Americans have of folklore comes through contact with commercial propagandists and a few energetic amateurs and collectors.
The work done by the analysts, the men who really know what folklore is all about, has no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reaches a limited, learned audience.
Publishers want books that will sell, recording studios want discs that will not seem strange to ears used to hillbilly and jazz music, grade and high schools want quaint, but moral, material.
The analyst is apt to be too honest to fit in.
As a result, most people don't have more than a vague idea what folklore actually is ; they see it as a potpourri of charming, moral legends and patriotic anecdotes, with a superstition or remedy thrown in here and there.
And so well is such ignorance preserved by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore courses given in the United States survive on sentiment and nationalism alone.
If one wishes to discuss a literary figure who uses folklore in his work, the first thing he must realize is that the literary figure is probably part of this ignorant American public.
And while every writer must be dealt with as a special case, the interested student will want to ask himself a number of questions about each.
Does the writer know the difference between an ersatz ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk?
When the writer uses material does he tamper with it to improve its commercial effect or does he leave it pure?
Is the writer propagandistic?
Is he swept away by sentiment and nostalgia for an America that was?
Or does he sincerely want to tap the real springs of American attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrassing they may be?
When he gets the answers to his questions he will be discouraged.
In the first place, a good many writers who are said to use folklore, do not, unless one counts an occasional superstition or tale.
Robert Frost, for instance, writes about rural life in New England, but he does not include any significant amount of folklore in his poems.
This has not, however, prevented publishers from labeling him a folk poet, simply because he is a rural one.
In the second place, a large number of writers, making a more direct claim than Frost to being folk writers of one sort or another, clearly make no distinctions between genuine and bogus material.
Stephen Vincent Benet's John Brown's Body comes immediately to mind in this connection, as does John Steinbeck's The Grapes Of Wrath and Carl Sandburg's The People, Yes.
The last two writers introduce strong political bias into their works, and not unlike the union leaders that we will discuss soon, see folklore as a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silenced mass.
Folklore, as used by such writers, really reflects images engraved into it by the very person using it.
The folk are simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude.
In fact, there is much evidence to indicate they don't care a bit about anything beyond their particular regional, ethnic and occupational limits.
Nevertheless, with a reading public that longs for the good old days and with an awareness of our expanding international interests, it is easy for the Benets to obtain a magnified position in literature by use of all sorts of Americana, real or fake, and it is easy for the Steinbecks and Sandburgs to support their messages of reform by reading messages of reform into the minds of the folk.
As part of the same arrangement, Torrio had, in the spirit of peace and good will, and in exchange for armed support in the April election campaign, bestowed upon O'*banion a third share in the Hawthorne Smoke Shop proceeds and a cut in the Cicero beer trade.
The coalition was to prove inadvisable.
O'*banion was a complex and frightening man, whose bright blue eyes stared with a kind of frozen candour into others'.
He had a round, frank Irish face, creased in a jovial grin that stayed bleakly in place even when he was pumping bullets into someone's body.
He carried three guns -- one in the right trouser pocket, one under his left armpit, one in the left outside coat pocket -- and was equally lethal with both hands.
He killed accurately, freely, and dispassionately.
The police credited him with twenty-five murders but he was never brought to trial for one of them.
Like a fair number of bootleggers he disliked alcohol.
He was an expert florist, tenderly dextrous in the arrangement of bouquets and wreaths.
He had no apparent comprehension of morality ; he divided humanity into right guys and wrong guys, and the wrong ones he was always willing to kill and trample under.
He had what was described by a psychologist as a sunny brutality.
He walked with a heavy list to the right, as that leg was four inches shorter than the other, but the lurch did not reduce his feline quickness with his guns.
Landesco thought him just a superior sort of plugugly but he was, in fact, with his aggression and hostility, and nerveless indifference to risking or administering pain, a casebook psychopath.
He was also at this time, although not so interwoven in high politics and the rackets as Torrio and Capone, the most powerful and most dangerous mob leader in the Chicago underworld, the roughneck king.
O'*banion was born in poverty, the son of an immigrant Irish plasterer, in the North Side's Little Hell, close by the Sicilian quarter and Death Corner.
He had been a choir boy at the Holy Name Cathedral and also served as an acolyte to Father O'*brien.
The influence of Mass was less pervasive than that of the congested, slum tenements among the bawdy houses, honkytonks, and sawdust saloons of his birthplace ; he ran wild with the child gangs of the neighbourhood, and went through the normal pressure-cooker course of thieving, police-dodging, and housebreaking.
At the age of ten, when he was working as a newsboy in the Loop, he was knocked down by a streetcar which resulted in his permanently shortened leg.
Because of this he was known as Gimpy ( but, as with Capone and his nickname of Scarface, never in his presence ).
In his teens O'*banion was enrolled in the vicious Market Street gang and he became a singing waiter in Mc*govern's Cafe, a notoriously low and rowdy dive in North Clark Street, where befuddled customers were methodically looted of their money by the singing waiters before being thrown out.
He then got a job with the Chicago Herald-*examiner as a circulation slugger, a rough fighter employed to see that his paper's news pitches were not trespassed upon by rival vendors.
He was also at the same time gaining practical experience as a safe breaker and highwayman, and learning how to shoot to kill from a Neanderthal convicted murderer named Gene Geary, later committed to Chester Asylum as a homicidal maniac, but whose eyes misted with tears when the young Dion sang a ballad about an Irish mother in his clear and syrupy tenor.
O'*banion's first conflict with the police came in 1909, at seventeen, when he was committed to Bridewell Prison for three months for burglary ; two years later he served another three months for assault.
Those were his only interludes behind bars, although he collected four more charges on his police record in 1921 and 1922, three for burglary and one for robbery.
But by now O'*banion's political pull was beginning to be effective.
On the occasion of his 1922 indictment the $10,000 bond was furnished by an alderman, and the charge was nolle prossed.
On one of his 1921 ventures he was actually come upon by a Detective Sergeant John J. Ryan down on his knees with a tool embedded in a labour office safe in the Postal Telegraph Building ; the jury wanted better evidence than that and he was acquitted, at a cost of $30,000 in bribes, it was estimated.
As promptly as Torrio, O'*banion jumped into bootlegging.
He conducted it with less diplomacy and more spontaneous violence than the Sicilians, but he had his huge North Side portion to exploit and he made a great deal of money.
Unlike the Sicilians, he additionally conducted holdups, robberies, and safe-cracking expeditions, and refused to touch prostitution.
He was also personally active in ward politics, and by 1924 O'*banion had acquired sufficient political might to be able to state : I always deliver my borough as per requirements.
But whose requirements?
Until 1924 O'*banion pistoleers and knuckle-duster bullyboys had kept his North Side domain solidly Democratic.
There was a question-and-answer gag that went around at that time : Q. who'll carry the Forty-second and Forty-third wards?
A. O'*banion, in his pistol pocket.
But as November 1924 drew close the Democratic hierarchy was sorely troubled by grapevine reports that O'*banion was being wooed by the opposition, and was meeting and conferring with important Republicans.
To forestall any change of allegiance, the Democrats hastily organised a testimonial banquet for O'*banion, as public reward for his past services and as a reminder of where his loyalties lay.
The reception was held in a private dining room of the Webster Hotel on Lincoln Park West.
It was an interesting fraternisation of ex-convicts, union racketeers, ward heelers, sold-out officials, and gunmen.
The guest list is in itself a little parable of the state of American civic life at this time.
It included the top O'*banion men and Chief of Detectives Michael Hughes.
When Mayor Dever heard of the banquet he summoned Hughes for an explanation of why he had been dishonouring the police department by consorting with these felons and fixers.
Hughes said that he had understood the party was to be in honour of Jerry O'*connor, the proprieter of a Loop gambling house.
But when I arrived and recognised a number of notorious characters I had thrown into the detective bureau basement half a dozen times, I knew I had been framed, and withdrew almost at once.
In fact, O'*connor was honoured during the ceremony with the presentation of a $2500 diamond stickpin.
There was a brief interruption while one of O'*banion's men jerked out both his guns and threatened to shoot a waiter who was pestering him for a tip.
Then O'*banion was presented with a platinum watch set with rubies and diamonds.
This dinner was the start of a new blatancy in the relationship between the gangs and the politicians, which, prior to 1924, says Pasley, had been maintained with more or less stealth, but which henceforth was marked by these ostentatious gatherings, denounced by a clergyman as Belshazzar feasts, at which politicians fraternized cheek by jowl with gangsters, openly, in the big downtown hotels.
Pasley continued : they became an institution of the Chicago scene and marked the way to the moral and financial collapse of the municipal and county governments in 1928-29.
However, this inaugural feast did its sponsors no good whatever.
O'*banion accepted his platinum watch and the tributes to his loyalty, and proceeded with the bigger and better Republican deal.
On Election Day -- November 4 -- he energetically marshalled his force of bludgeon men, bribers, and experts in forging repeat votes.
The result was a landslide for the Republican candidates.
This further demonstration of O'*banion's ballooning power did not please Torrio and Capone.
In the past year there had been too many examples of his euphoric self-confidence and self-aggrandisement for their liking.
He behaved publicly with a cocky, swaggering truculence that offended their vulpine Latin minds, and behaved towards them personally with an unimpressed insolence that enraged them beneath their blandness.
They were disturbed by his idiotic bravado -- as, when his bodyguard, Yankee Schwartz, complained that he had been snubbed by Dave Miller, a prize-fight referee, chieftain of a Jewish gang and one of four brothers of tough reputation, who were Hirschey, a gambler-politician in loose beer-running league with Torrio and O'*banion, Frank, a policeman, and Max, the youngest.
To settle this slight, O'*banion went down to the La Salle Theatre in the Loop, where, he had learned, Dave Miller was attending the opening of a musical comedy.
At the end of the performance, Dave and Max came out into the brilliantly lit foyer among a surge of gowned and tuxedoed first nighters.
O'*banion drew his guns and fired at Dave, severely wounding him in the stomach.
A second bullet ricocheted off Max's belt buckle, leaving him unhurt but in some distress.
O'*banion tucked away his gun and walked out of the theatre ; he was neither prosecuted nor even arrested.
That sort of braggadocio, for that sort of reason, in the view of Torrio and Capone, was a nonsense.
A further example of the incompatible difference in personalities was when two policemen held up a Torrio beer convoy on a West Side street and demanded $300 to let it through.
One of the beer-runners telephoned O'*banion -- on a line tapped by the detective bureau -- and reported the situation.
O'*banion's reaction was : three hundred dollars ] to them bums?
Why, I can get them knocked off for half that much.
Upon which the detective bureau despatched rifle squads to prevent trouble if O'*banion should send his gunmen out to deal with the hijacking policemen.
But in the meantime the beer-runner, unhappy with this solution, telephoned Torrio and returned to O'*banion with the message : say, Dionie, I just been talking to Johnny, and he said to let them cops have the three hundred.
He says he don't want no trouble.
But Torrio and Capone had graver cause to hate and distrust the Irishman.
For three years, since the liquor territorial conference, Torrio had, with his elastic patience, and because he knew that retaliation could cause only violent warfare and disaster to business, tolerated O'*banion's impudent double-crossing.
They had suffered, in sulky silence, the sight of his sharp practice in Cicero.
When, as a diplomatic gesture of amity and in payment for the loan of gunmen in the April election, Torrio had given O'*banion a slice of Cicero, the profits from that district had been $20,000 a month.
In six months O'*banion had boosted the profits to $100,000 a month -- mainly by bringing pressure to bear on fifty Chicago speak-easy proprietors to shift out to the suburb.
These booze customers had until then been buying their supplies from the Sheldon, Saltis-*mc*erlane, and Druggan-*lake gangs, and now they were competing for trade with the Torrio-*capone saloons ; once again O'*banion's brash recklessness had caused a proliferation of ill will.
The revenue from O'*banion's Cicero territory went up still higher, until the yield was more than the Torrio-*capone takings from the far bigger trade area of Chicago's South and West Sides.
But he still showed no intention of sharing with the syndicate.
At last, even the controlled Torrio was unable to hold still, and he tentatively suggested that O'*banion should take a percentage in the Stickney brothels in return for one from his Cicero beer concession.
O'*banion's reply was a raucous laugh and a flat refusal.
Still more jealous bitterness was engendered by the O'*banion gang's seizure from a West Side marshalling yard of a freight-car load of Canadian whisky worth $100,000 and by one of the biggest coups of the Prohibition era -- the Sibley warehouse robbery, which became famous for the cool brazenness of the operation.
Here was stored $1,000,000 worth of bonded whisky.
These 1750 cases were carted off in a one-night operation by the O'*banion men, who left in their stead the same number of barrels filled with water.
A tsunami may be started by a sea bottom slide, an earthquake or a volcanic eruption.
The most infamous of all was launched by the explosion of the island of Krakatoa in 1883 ; it raced across the Pacific at 300 miles an hour, devastated the coasts of Java and Sumatra with waves 100 to 130 feet high, and pounded the shore as far away as San Francisco.
The ancient Greeks recorded several catastrophic inundations by huge waves.
Whether or not Plato's tale of the lost continent of Atlantis is true, skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient times.
Indeed, a tremendously destructive tsunami that arose in the Arabian Sea in 1945 has even revived the interest of geologists and archaeologists in the Biblical story of the Flood.
One of the most damaging tsunami on record followed the famous Lisbon earthquake of November 1, 1755 ; its waves persisted for a week and were felt as far away as the English coast.
Tsunami are rare, however, in the Atlantic Ocean ; they are far more common in the Pacific.
Japan has had 15 destructive ones ( eight of them disastrous ) since 1596.
The Hawaiian Islands are struck severely an average of once every 25 years.
In 1707 an earthquake in Japan generated waves so huge that they piled into the Inland Sea ; one wave swamped more than 1,000 ships and boats in Osaka Bay.
A tsunami in the Hawaiian Islands in 1869 washed away an entire town ( Ponoluu ), leaving only two forlorn trees standing where the community had been.
In 1896 a Japanese tsunami killed 27,000 people and swept away 10,000 homes.
The dimensions of these waves dwarf all our usual standards of measurement.
An ordinary sea wave is rarely more than a few hundred feet long from crest to crest -- no longer than 320 feet in the Atlantic or 1,000 feet in the Pacific.
But a tsunami often extends more than 100 miles and sometimes as much as 600 miles from crest to crest.
While a wind wave never travels at more than 60 miles per hour, the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckoned in hundreds of miles per hour.
The greater the depth of the water, the greater is the speed of the wave ; Lagrange's law says that its velocity is equal to the square root of the product of the depth times the acceleration due to gravity.
In the deep waters of the Pacific these waves reach a speed of 500 miles per hour.
Tsunami are so shallow in comparison with their length that in the open ocean they are hardly detectable.
Their amplitude sometimes is as little as two feet from trough to crest.
Usually it is only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to their terrifying heights.
On the fateful day in 1896 when the great waves approached Japan, fishermen at sea noticed no unusual swells.
Not until they sailed home at the end of the day, through a sea strewn with bodies and the wreckage of houses, were they aware of what had happened.
The seemingly quiet ocean had crashed a wall of water from 10 to 100 feet high upon beaches crowded with bathers, drowning thousands of them and flattening villages along the shore.
The giant waves are more dangerous on flat shores than on steep ones.
They usually range from 20 to 60 feet in height, but when they pour into a *j inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportions.
Generally the first salvo of a tsunami is a rather sharp swell, not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observers.
This is followed by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore as the first great trough arrives.
Reefs are left high and dry, and the beaches are covered with stranded fish.
At Hilo large numbers of people ran out to inspect the amazing spectacle of the denuded beach.
Many of them paid for their curiosity with their lives, for some minutes later the first giant wave roared over the shore.
After an earthquake in Japan in 1793 people on the coast at Tugaru were so terrified by the extraordinary ebbing of the sea that they scurried to higher ground.
When a second quake came, they dashed back to the beach, fearing that they might be buried under landslides.
Just as they reached the shore, the first huge wave crashed upon them.
A tsunami is not a single wave but a series.
The waves are separated by intervals of 15 minutes to an hour or more ( because of their great length ), and this has often lulled people into thinking after the first great wave has crashed that it is all over.
The waves may keep coming for many hours.
Usually the third to the eighth waves in the series are the biggest.
Among the observers of the 1946 tsunami at Hilo was Francis P. Shepard of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, one of the world's foremost marine geologists.
He was able to make a detailed inspection of the waves.
Their onrush and retreat, he reported, was accompanied by a great hissing, roaring and rattling.
The third and fourth waves seemed to be the highest.
On some of the islands' beaches the waves came in gently ; they were steepest on the shores facing the direction of the seaquake from which the waves had come.
In Hilo Bay they were from 21 to 26 feet high.
The highest waves, 55 feet, occurred at Pololu Valley.
Scientists and fishermen have occasionally seen strange by-products of the phenomenon.
During a 1933 tsunami in Japan the sea glowed brilliantly at night.
The luminosity of the water is now believed to have been caused by the stimulation of vast numbers of the luminescent organism Noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea.
Japanese fishermen have sometimes observed that sardines hauled up in their nets during a tsunami have enormously swollen stomachs ; the fish have swallowed vast numbers of bottom-living diatoms, raised to the surface by the disturbance.
The waves of a 1923 tsunami in Sagami Bay brought to the surface and battered to death huge numbers of fishes that normally live at a depth of 3,000 feet.
Gratified fishermen hauled them in by the thousands.
The tsunami-warning system developed since the 1946 disaster in Hawaii relies mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devised by Commander C. K. Green of the Coast and Geodetic Survey staff.
It consists of a series of pipes and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface.
Ordinary water tides are disregarded.
But when waves with a period of between 10 and 40 minutes begin to roll over the ocean, they set in motion a corresponding oscillation in a column of mercury which closes an electric circuit.
This in turn sets off an alarm, notifying the observers at the station that a tsunami is in progress.
Such equipment has been installed at Hilo, Midway, Attu and Dutch Harbor.
The moment the alarm goes off, information is immediately forwarded to Honolulu, which is the center of the warning system.
This center also receives prompt reports on earthquakes from four Coast Survey stations in the Pacific which are equipped with seismographs.
Its staff makes a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alerts tide stations near the epicenter for a tsunami.
By means of charts showing wave-travel times and depths in the ocean at various locations, it is possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at Hawaii of a tsunami getting under way at any spot in the Pacific.
The civil and military authorities are then advised of the danger, and they issue warnings and take all necessary protective steps.
All of these activities are geared to a top-priority communication system, and practice tests have been held to assure that everything will work smoothly.
Since the 1946 disaster there have been 15 tsunami in the Pacific, but only one was of any consequence.
On November 4, 1952, an earthquake occurred under the sea off the Kamchatka Peninsula.
At 17:07 that afternoon ( Greenwich time ) the shock was recorded by the seismograph alarm in Honolulu.
The warning system immediately went into action.
Within about an hour with the help of reports from seismic stations in Alaska, Arizona and California, the quake's epicenter was placed at 51 degrees North latitude and 158 degrees East longitude.
While accounts of the progress of the tsunami came in from various points in the Pacific ( Midway reported it was covered with nine feet of water ), the Hawaiian station made its calculations and notified the military services and the police that the first big wave would arrive at Honolulu at 23:30 Greenwich time.
It turned out that the waves were not so high as in 1946.
They hurled a cement barge against a freighter in Honolulu Harbor, knocked down telephone lines, marooned automobiles, flooded lawns, killed six cows.
But not a single human life was lost, and property damage in the Hawaiian Islands did not exceed $800,000.
There is little doubt that the warning system saved lives and reduced the damage.
But it is plain that a warning system, however efficient, is not enough.
In the vulnerable areas of the Pacific there should be restrictions against building homes on exposed coasts, or at least a requirement that they be either raised off the ground or anchored strongly against waves.
The key to the world of geology is change ; nothing remains the same.
Life has evolved from simple combinations of molecules in the sea to complex combinations in man.
The land, too, is changing, and earthquakes are daily reminders of this.
Earthquakes result when movements in the earth twist rocks until they break.
Sometimes this is accompanied by visible shifts of the ground surface ; often the shifts cannot be seen, but they are there ; and everywhere can be found scars of earlier breaks once deeply buried.
Today's earthquakes are most numerous in belts where the earth's restlessness is presently concentrated, but scars of the past show that there is no part of the earth that has not had them.
The effects of earthquakes on civilization have been widely publicized, even overemphasized.
The role of an earthquake in starting the destruction of whole cities is tremendously frightening, but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster.
Superstition has often blended with fact to color reports.
We have learned from earthquakes much of what we now know about the earth's interior, for they send waves through the earth which emerge with information about the materials through which they have traveled.
These waves have shown that 1,800 miles below the surface a liquid core begins, and that it, in turn, has a solid inner core.
Earthquakes originate as far as 400 miles below the surface, but they do not occur at greater depths.
Two unsolved mysteries are based on these facts.
( 1 ) as far down as 400 miles below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twisting forces by sluggish flow rather than by breaking, as rigid surface rocks do.
( 2 ) if earthquakes do occur at such depths, why not deeper?
Knowledge gained from studying earthquake waves has been applied in various fields.
In the search for oil and gas, we make similar waves under controlled conditions with dynamite and learn from them where there are buried rock structures favorable to the accumulation of these resources.
We have also developed techniques for recognizing and locating underground nuclear tests through the waves in the ground which they generate.
The following discussion of this subject has been adapted from the book Causes Of Catastrophe by L. Don Leet.
The restless earth and its interior at twelve minutes after five on the morning of Wednesday, April 18, 1906, San Francisco was shaken by a severe earthquake.
A sharp tremor was followed by a jerky roll.
In Ireland's County Limerick, near the River Shannon, there is a quiet little suburb by the name of Garryowen, which means Garden of Owen.
Undoubtedly none of the residents realize the influence their town has had on American military history, or the deeds of valor that have been done in its name.
The cry Garryowen ] bursting from the lips of a charging cavalry trooper was the last sound heard on this earth by untold numbers of Cheyennes, Sioux and Apaches, Mexican banditos under Pancho Villa, Japanese in the South Pacific, and Chinese and North Korean Communists in Korea.
Garryowen is the battle cry of the 7th U.*s. Cavalry Regiment, The Fighting Seventh.
Today a battle cry may seem an anachronism, for in the modern Army, esprit de corps has been sacrificed to organizational charts and tables.
But don't tell that to a veteran of the Fighting Seventh, especially in a saloon on Saturday night.
Of all the thousands of men who have served in the 7th Cav, perhaps no one knows its spirit better than Lieutenant Colonel Melbourne C. Chandler.
Wiry and burr-headed, with steel blue eyes and a chest splattered with medals, Chandler is the epitome of the old-time trooper.
The truth is, however, that when Mel Chandler first reported to the regiment the only steed he had ever ridden was a swivel chair and the only weapon he had ever wielded was a pencil.
Chandler had been commissioned in the Medical Service Corps and was serving as a personnel officer for the Kansas City Medical Depot when he decided that if he was going to make the Army his career, he wanted to be in the fighting part of it.
Though he knew no more about military science and tactics than any other desk officer, he managed to get transferred to the combat forces.
The next thing he knew he was reporting for duty as commanding officer of Troop *j, 7th Cavalry, in the middle of corps maneuvers in Japan.
Outside of combat, he couldn't have landed in a tougher spot.
First of all, no unit likes to have a new *j brought in from the outside, especially when he's an armchair trooper.
Second, if there is ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under him, it's on maneuvers.
In combat, helping your *j make a fool of himself might mean getting yourself killed.
But in maneuvers, with the top brass watching him all the time, it's easy.
Chandler understood this and expected the worst.
But his first few days with Troop *j were full of surprises, beginning with First Sergeant Robert Early.
Chandler had expected a tough old trooper with a gravel voice.
Instead Sergeant Early was quiet, sharp and confident.
He had enlisted in the Army straight out of high school and had immediately set about learning his new trade.
There was no weapon Early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded.
He could lead a patrol and he knew his paper work.
Further, he had taken full advantage of the Army's correspondence courses.
He not only knew soldiering, but mathematics, history and literature as well.
But for all his erudite confidence, Sergeant Early was right out of the Garryowen mold.
He was filled with the spirit of the Fighting Seventh.
That saved Mel Chandler.
Sergeant Early let the new *j know just how lucky he was to be in the best troop in the best regiment in the United States Army.
He fed the captain bits of history about the troops and the regiment.
For example, it was a battalion of the 7th Cavalry under Colonel George Armstrong Custer that had been wiped out at the Battle of The Little Big Horn.
It didn't take Captain Chandler long to realize that he had to carry a heavy load of tradition on his shoulders as commander of Troop *j.
But what made the load lighter was the realization that every officer, non-com and trooper was ready and willing to help him carry it, for the good of the troop and the regiment.
Maneuvers over, the 7th returned to garrison duty in Tokyo, Captain Chandler still with them.
It was the 7th Cavalry whose troopers were charged with guarding the Imperial Palace of the Emperor.
But still Mel Chandler was not completely convinced that men would really die for a four-syllable word, Garryowen.
The final proof was a small incident.
It happened at the St. Patrick's Day party, a big affair for a regiment which had gone into battle for over three-quarters of a century to the strains of an Irish march.
In the middle of the party Chandler looked up to see four smiling faces bearing down upon him, each beaming above the biggest, greenest shamrock he had ever seen.
The faces belonged to Lieutenant Marvin Goulding, his wife and their two children.
And when the singing began, it was the Gouldings who sang the old Irish songs the best.
Though there was an occasional good-natured chuckle about Marvin Goulding, the Jewish officer from Chicago, singing tearfully about the ould sod, no one really thought it was strange.
For Marvin Goulding, like Giovanni Martini, the bugler boy who carried Custer's last message, or Margarito Lopez, the one-man Army on Leyte, was a Garryowen, through and through.
It was no coincidence that Goulding was one of the most beloved platoon leaders in the regiment.
And so Mel Chandler got the spirit of Garryowen.
He set out to keep Troop *j the best troop in the best regiment.
One of his innovations was to see to it that every man -- cook and clerk as well as rifleman -- qualified with every weapon in the troop.
Even the mess sergeant, Bill Brown, a dapper, cocky transfer from an airborne division, went out on the range.
The troop received a new leader, Lieutenant Robert M. Carroll, fresh out of *j and bucking for Regular Army status.
Carroll was sharp and military, but he was up against tough competition for that *j berth, and he wanted to play it cool.
So Mel Chandler set out to sell him on the spirit of Garryowen, just as he himself had been sold a short time before.
When the Korean war began, on June 25, 1950, the anniversary of the day Custer had gone down fighting at the Little Big Horn and the day the regiment had assaulted the beachhead of Leyte during World War 2, the 7th Cavalry was not in the best fighting condition.
Its entire complement of non-commissioned officers on the platoon level had departed as cadre for another unit, and its vehicles were still those used in the drive across Luzon in World War 2.
Just a month after the Korean War broke out, the 7th Cavalry was moving into the lines, ready for combat.
From then on the Fighting Seventh was in the thick of the bitterest fighting in Korea.
One night on the Naktong River, Mel Chandler called on that fabled esprit de corps.
The regiment was dug in on the east side of the river and the North Koreans were steadily building up a concentration of crack troops on the other side.
The troopers knew an attack was coming, but they didn't know when, and they didn't know where.
At 6 o'clock on the morning of August 12, they were in doubt no longer.
Then it came, against Troop *j.
The enemy had filtered across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 men, armed with Russian machine guns, attacked the position held by Chandler's men.
They came in waves.
First came the cannon fodder, white-clad civilians being driven into death as a massive human battering ram.
They were followed by crack North Korean troops, who mounted one charge after another.
They overran the 7th Cav's forward machine-gun positions through sheer weight of numbers, over piles of their own dead.
Another force flanked the company and took up a position on a hill to the rear.
Captain Chandler saw that it was building up strength.
He assembled a group of 25 men, composed of wounded troopers awaiting evacuation, the company clerk, supply men, cooks and drivers, and led them to the hill.
One of the more seriously wounded was Lieutenant Carroll, the young officer bucking for the Regular Army.
Chandler left Carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcements he could find to the fight.
Then Mel Chandler started up the hill.
He took one step, two, broke into a trot and then into a run.
The first thing he knew the words Garryowen ] burst from his throat.
His followers shouted the old battle cry after him and charged the hill, firing as they ran.
The Koreans fell back, but regrouped at the top of the hill and pinned down the cavalrymen with a screen of fire.
Chandler, looking to right and left to see how his men were faring, suddenly saw another figure bounding up the hill, hurling grenades and hollering the battle cry as he ran.
It was Bob Carroll, who had suddenly found himself imbued with the spirit of Garryowen.
He had formed his own task force of three stragglers and led them up the hill in a Fighting Seventh charge.
Because of this diversionary attack the main group that had been pinned down on the hill was able to surge forward again.
But an enemy grenade hit Carroll in the head and detonated simultaneously.
He went down like a wet rag and the attackers hit the dirt in the face of the withering enemy fire.
Enemy reinforcements came pouring down, seeking a soft spot.
They found it at the junction between Troops *j and *j, and prepared to counterattack.
Marvin Goulding saw what was happening.
He turned to his platoon.
Okay, men, he said.
Follow me.
Goulding leaped to his feet and started forward, Garryowen ] on his lips, his men following.
But the bullets whacked home before he finished his battle cry and Marvin Goulding fell dead.
For an instant his men hesitated, unable to believe that their lieutenant, the most popular officer in the regiment, was dead.
Then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and, cursing, screaming and hollering Garryowen ] they charged into the enemy like wild men.
That finished the job that Captain Chandler and Lieutenant Carroll had begun.
Goulding's platoon pushed back the enemy soldiers and broke up the timing of the entire enemy attack.
Reinforcements came up quickly to take advantage of the opening made by Goulding's platoon.
The North Koreans threw away their guns and fled across the rice paddies.
Artillery and air strikes were called in to kill them by the hundreds.
Though Bob Carroll seemed to have had his head practically blown off by the exploding grenade, he lived.
Today he is a major -- in the Regular Army.
So filled was Mel Chandler with the spirit of Garryowen that after Korea was over, he took on the job of writing the complete history of the regiment.
After years of digging, nights and weekends, he put together the big, profusely illustrated book, Of Garryowen And Glory, which is probably the most complete history of any military unit.
The battle of the Naktong River is just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of The Fighting Seventh have paid off.
For nearly a century the cry has never failed to rally the fighting men of the regiment.
Take the case of Major Marcus A. Reno, who survived the Battle of The Little Big Horn in 1876.
From the enlisted men he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he tried to rape, a lot of men had plenty of reason heartily to dislike Marcus Reno.
Many of his fellow officers refused to speak to him.
But when a board of inquiry was called to look into the charges of cowardice made against him, the men who had seen Reno leave the battlefield and the officer who had heard Reno suggest that the wounded be left to be tortured by the Sioux, refused to say a harsh word against him.
He was a member of The Fighting Seventh.
Although it was at the Battle of The Little Horn, about which more words have been written than any other battle in American history, that the 7th Cavalry first made its mark in history, the regiment was ten years old by then.
Brevet Major General George Armstrong Custer was the regiment's first permanent commander and, like such generals as George S. Patton and Terry De La Mesa Allen in their rise to military prominence, Custer was a believer in blood and guts warfare.
During the Civil War, Custer, who achieved a brilliant record, was made brigadier general at the age of 23.
He finished the war as a major general, commanding a full division, and at 25 was the youngest major general in the history of the U.*s. Army.
I do not mean to suggest that these assumptions are self-evident, in the sense that everyone agrees with them.
If they were, Walter Lippmann would be writing the same columns as George Sokolsky, and Herb Lock would have nothing to draw cartoons about.
I do mean, however, that I take them for granted, and that everything I shall be saying would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumptions.
Assumption 1.
The ultimate objective of American policy is to help establish a world in which there is the largest possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity ; and in particular -- since this is our special responsibility -- that these conditions be enjoyed by the people of the United States.
I speak of the largest possible measure because any person who supposes that these conditions can be universally and perfectly achieved -- ever -- reckons without the inherent imperfectability of himself and his fellow human beings, and is therefore a dangerous man to have around.
Assumption 2.
These conditions are unobtainable -- are not even approachable in the qualified sense I have indicated -- without the prior defeat of world Communism.
This is true for two reasons : because Communism is both doctrinally, and in practice, antithetical to these conditions ; and because Communists have the will and, as long as Soviet power remains intact, the capacity to prevent their realization.
Moreover, as Communist power increases, the enjoyment of these conditions throughout the world diminishes pro rata and the possibility of their restoration becomes increasingly remote.
Assumption 3.
It follows that victory over Communism is the dominant, proximate goal of American policy.
Proximate in the sense that there are more distant, more positive ends we seek, to which victory over Communism is but a means.
But dominant in the sense that every other objective, no matter how worthy intrinsically, must defer to it.
Peace is a worthy objective ; but if we must choose between peace and keeping the Communists out of Berlin, then we must fight.
Freedom, in the sense of self-determination, is a worthy objective ; but if granting self-determination to the Algerian rebels entails sweeping that area into the Sino-*soviet orbit, then Algerian freedom must be postponed.
Justice is a worthy objective ; but if justice for Bantus entails driving the government of the Union of South Africa away from the West, then the Bantus must be prepared to carry their identification cards yet a while longer.
Prosperity is a worthy objective ; but if providing higher standards of living gets in the way of producing sufficient guns to resist Communist aggression, then material sacrifices and denials will have to be made.
It may be, of course, that such objectives can be pursued consisently with a policy designed to overthrow Communism ; my point is that where conflicts arise they must always be resolved in favor of achieving the indispensable condition for a tolerant world -- the absence of Soviet Communist power.
The uses of power this much having been said, the question remains whether we have the resources for the job we have to do -- defeat Communism -- and, if so, how those resources ought to be used.
This brings us squarely to the problem of power, and the uses a nation makes of power.
I submit that this is the key problem of international relations, that it always has been, that it always will be.
And I suggest further that the main cause of the trouble we are in has been the failure of American policy-makers, ever since we assumed free world leadership in 1945, to deal with this problem realistically and seriously.
In the recent political campaign two charges were leveled affecting the question of power, and I think we might begin by trying to put them into proper focus.
One was demonstrably false ; the other, for the most part, true.
The first was that America had become -- or was in danger of becoming -- a second-rate military power.
I know I do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention.
You may have misgivings about certain aspects of our military establishment -- I certainly do -- but you know any comparison of over-all American strength with over-all Soviet strength finds the United States not only superior, but so superior both in present weapons and in the development of new ones that our advantage promises to be a permanent feature of U.*s.-*soviet relations for the foreseeable future.
I have often searched for a graphic way of impressing our superiority on those Americans who have doubts, and I think Mr. Jameson Campaigne has done it well in his new book American Might And Soviet Myth.
Suppose, he says, that the tables were turned, and we were in the Soviets' position : there would be more than 2,000 modern Soviet fighters, all better than ours, stationed at 250 bases in Mexico and the Caribbean.
Overwhelming Russian naval power would always be within a few hundred miles of our coast.
Half of the population of the U.*s. would be needed to work on arms just to feed the people.
Add this to the unrest in the countries around us where oppressed peoples would be ready to turn on us at the first opportunity.
Add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit our capacity to keep abreast of the Soviets even in the missile field which is reputed to be our main strength.
If we look at the situation this way, we can get an idea of Khrushchev's nightmarish worries -- or, at least, of the worries he might have if his enemies were disposed to exploit their advantage.
U.*s. prestige the other charge was that America's political position in the world has progressively deteriorated in recent years.
The contention needs to be formulated with much greater precision than it ever was during the campaign, but once that has been done, I fail to see how any serious student of world affairs can quarrel with it.
The argument was typically advanced in terms of U.*s. prestige.
Prestige, however, is only a minor part of the problem ; and even then, it is a concept that can be highly misleading.
Prestige is a measure of how other people think of you, well or ill.
But contrary to what was implied during the campaign, prestige is surely not important for its own sake.
Only the vain and incurably sentimental among us will lose sleep simply because foreign peoples are not as impressed by our strength as they ought to be.
The thing to lose sleep over is what people, having concluded that we are weaker than we are, are likely to do about it.
The evidence suggests that foreign peoples believe the United States is weaker than the Soviet Union, and is bound to fall still further behind in the years ahead.
This ignorant estimate, I repeat, is not of any interest in itself ; but it becomes very important if foreign peoples react the way human beings typically do -- namely, by taking steps to end up on what appears to be the winning side.
To the extent, then, that declining U.*s. prestige means that other nations will be tempted to place their bets on an ultimate American defeat, and will thus be more vulnerable to Soviet intimidation, there is reason for concern.
Still, these guesses about the outcome of the struggle cannot be as important as the actual power relationship between the Soviet Union and ourselves.
Here I do not speak of military power where our advantage is obvious and overwhelming but of political power -- of influence, if you will -- about which the relevant questions are : is Soviet influence throughout the world greater or less than it was ten years ago?
And is Western influence greater or less than it used to be?
Communist gains in answering these questions, we need to ask not merely whether Communist troops have crossed over into territories they did not occupy before, and not merely whether disciplined agents of the Cominform are in control of governments from which they were formerly excluded : the success of Communism's war against the West does not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquests.
Success may mean merely the displacement of Western influence.
Communist political warfare, we must remember, is waged insidiously and in deliberate stages.
Fearful of inviting a military showdown with the West which they could not win, the Communists seek to undermine Western power where the nuclear might of the West is irrelevant -- in backwoods guerrilla skirmishes, in mob uprisings in the streets, in parliaments, in clandestine meetings of undercover conspirators, at the United Nations, on the propaganda front, at diplomatic conferences -- preferably at the highest level.
The Soviets understand, moreover, that the first step in turning a country toward Communism is to turn it against the West.
Thus, typically, the first stage of a Communist takeover is to neutralize a country.
The second stage is to retain the nominal classification of neutralist, while in fact turning the country into an active advocate and adherent of Soviet policy.
And this may be as far as the process will go.
The Kremlin's goal is the isolation and capture, not of Ghana, but of the United States -- and this purpose may be served very well by countries that masquerade under a neutralist mask, yet in fact are dependable auxiliaries of the Soviet Foreign Office.
To recite the particulars of recent Soviet successes is hardly reassuring.
Six years ago French Indochina, though in troubie, was in the Western camp.
Today Northern Vietnam is overtly Communist ; Laos is teetering between Communism and pro-*communist neutralism ; Cambodia is, for all practical purposes, neutralist.
Indonesia, in the early days of the Republic, leaned toward the West.
Today Sukarno's government is heavily besieged by avowed Communists, and for all of its neutralist pretensions, it is a firm ally of Soviet policy.
Ceylon has moved from a pro-*western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the West.
In the Middle East, Iraq, Syria and Egypt were, a short while ago, in the Western camp.
Today the Nasser and Kassem governments are adamantly hostile to the West, are dependent for their military power on Soviet equipment and personnel ; in almost every particular follow the Kremlin's foreign policy line.
A short time ago all Africa was a Western preserve.
Never mind whether the Kikiyus and the Bantus enjoyed Wilsonian self-determination : the point is that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass was under the domination and influence of the West.
Today, Africa is swerving violently away from the West and plunging, it would seem, into the Soviet orbit.
Latin America was once an area as safe for the West as Nebraska was for Nixon.
Today it is up for grabs.
One Latin American country, Cuba, has become a Soviet bridgehead ninety miles off our coast.
In some countries the trend has gone further than others : Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela are displaying open sympathy for Castroism, and there is no country -- save the Dominican Republic whose funeral services we recently arranged -- where Castroism and Anti-*americanism does not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espousing the American cause.
Only in Europe have our lines remained firm -- and there only on the surface.
The strains of neutralism are running strong, notably in England, and even in Germany.
Opportunities missed what have we to show by way of counter-successes?
We have had opportunities -- clear invitations to plant our influence on the other side of the Iron Curtain.
There was the Hungarian Revolution which we praised and mourned, but did nothing about.
There was the Polish Revolution which we misunderstood and then helped guide along a course favorable to Soviet interests.
There was the revolution in Tibet which we pretended did not exist.
Only in one instance have we moved purposively and effectively to dislodge existing Communist power : in Guatemala.
And contrary to what has been said recently, we did not wait for outside pressures and world opinion to bring down that Communist government ; we moved decisively to effect an Anti-*communist coup d'etat.
We served our national interests, and by so doing we saved the Guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery.
The first rattle of the machine guns, at 7:10 in the evening, roused around me the varied voices and faces of fear.
Sounds exactly like last time.
The young man spoke steadily enough, but all at once he looked grotesquely unshaven.
The middle-aged man said over and over, why did I come here, why did I come here.
Then he was sick.
Amid the crackle of small arms and automatic weapons, I heard the thumping of mortars.
Then the lights went out.
This was my second day in Vientiane, the administrative capital of Laos, and my thoughts were none too brave.
Where was my flashlight?
Where should I go?
To my room?
Better stay in the hotel lobby, where the walls looked good and thick.
Chinese and Indian merchants across the street were slamming their steel shutters.
Hotel attendants pulled parked bicycles into the lobby.
A woman with a small boy slipped in between them.
Please, she said, please.
She held out her hand to show that she had money.
The American newspaperman worried about getting to the cable office.
But what was the story?
Had the Communist-led Pathet Lao finally come this far?
Or was it another revolt inside Vientiane?
Let's play hero, I said.
Let's go to the roof and see.
Gunfire saves the moon by 7:50 the answer was plain.
There had been an eclipse of the moon.
A traditional Lao explanation is that the moon was being swallowed by a toad, and the remedy was to make all possible noise, ideally with firearms.
The din was successful, too, for just before the moon disappeared, the frightened toad had begun to spit it out again, which meant good luck all around.
How quaint it all seemed the next day.
A restaurant posted a reminder to patrons who became excited and left without paying their checks.
But everyone I met had sought cover first and asked questions later.
And no wonder, for Vientiane, the old City of Sandalwood, had become the City of Bullet Holes.
I saw holes in planes at the airport and in cars in the streets.
Along the main thoroughfares hardly a house had not been peppered.
In place of the police headquarters was a new square filled with rubble.
Mortars had demolished the defense ministry and set fire to the American Embassy next door.
What had been the ambassador's suite was now jagged walls of blackened brick.
This damage had been done in the battle of Vientiane, fought less than three months earlier when four successive governments had ruled here in three days ( December 9-11, 1960 ).
And now, in March, all Laos suffered a state of siege.
The Pathet Lao forces held two northern provinces and openly took the offensive in three more.
Throughout the land their hit-and-run terrorists spread fear of ambush and death.
And it's all the more tragic because it's so little deserved, said Mr. J. J. A. Frans, a Belgian official of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.
We talked after I hailed his Jeep marked with the U.*n. flag.
Practically all the people of Laos, he explained -- about two million of them -- are rice farmers, and the means and motives of modern war are as strange to them as clocks and steel plows.
They look after their fields and children and water buffaloes in ten or eleven thousand villages, with an average of 200 souls.
Nobody can tell more closely how many villages there are.
They spread over an area no larger than Oregon ; yet they include peoples as different from one another as Oregonians are from Patagonians.
Life must be kept in harmony.
What matters here is family loyalty ; faith in the Buddha and staying at peace with the phis, the spirits ; and to live in harmony with nature.
Harmony in Laos?
Precisely, said Mr. Frans.
He spoke of the season of dryness and dust, brought by the monsoon from the northeast, in harmony with the season of rain and mud, brought by the monsoon from the southwest.
The slim pirogues in harmony with the majestically meandering Mekong River.
Shy, slender-waisted girls at the loom in harmony with the frangipani by the wayside.
Even life in harmony with death.
For so long as death was not violent, it was natural and to be welcomed, making a funeral a feast.
To many a Frenchman -- they came 95 years ago, colonized, and stayed until Laos became independent in 1953 -- the land had been even more delightfully tranquil than Tahiti.
Yet Laos was now one of the most explosive headaches of statesmen around the globe.
The Pathet Lao, stiffened by Communist Veterans from neighboring North Viet Nam, were supplied by Soviet aircraft.
The Royal Lao Army, on the other hand, was paid and equipped with American funds.
In six years, U.*s. aid had amounted to more than $1.60 for each American -- a total of three hundred million dollars.
We were there at a moment when the situation in Laos threatened to ignite another war among the world's giants.
Even if it did not, how would this little world of gentle people cope with its new reality of grenades and submachine guns?
To find out, we traveled throughout that part of Laos still nominally controlled, in the daytime at least, by the Royal Lao Army : from Attopeu, the City of Buffalo Dung in the southeast, to Muong Sing, the City of Lions in the northwest, close to Communist China ( map, page 250 ).
We rode over roads so rough that our Jeep came to rest atop the soil between ruts, all four wheels spinning uselessly.
We flew in rickety planes so overloaded that we wondered why they didn't crash.
In the end we ran into Communist artillery fire.
We were Bill Garrett of the National Geographic Illustrations Staff, whose three cameras and eight lenses made him look as formidable as any fighting man we met ; Boun My, our interpreter ; and myself.
Boun My -- the name means one who has a boun, a celebration, and is therefore lucky -- was born in Savannakhet, the Border of Paradise.
He had attended three universities in the United States.
But he had never seen the mountainous half of his native land north of Vientiane, including the royal capital, Luang Prabang.
Before the airplanes came, he said, travel in Laos was just about impossible.
Prime minister moves fast alas, so it almost proved for us, too.
To go outside the few cities required permits.
And getting them seemed a life's work.
Nobody wanted Americans to be hurt or captured, and few soldiers could be spared as escorts.
We were told that to the Pathet Lao, a kidnaped American was worth at least $750, a fortune in Laos.
Everyone had heard of the American contractor who had spurned an escort.
Now Pathet Lao propagandists were reported marching him barefoot from village to village, as evidence of evil American intervention.
Although we enjoyed our rounds of the government offices in Vientiane, with officials offering tea and pleasing conversation in French, we were getting nowhere.
We had nearly decided that all the tales of Lao lethargy must be true, when we were invited to take a trip with the Prime Minister.
Could we be ready in 15 minutes?
His Highness had decided only two hours ago to go out of town, and he was eager to be off.
Prince wears ten-gallon hat and so, after a flight southeast to Savannakhet, we found ourselves bouncing along in a Jeep right behind the Land-*rover of Prince Boun Oum of Champassak, a tall man of Churchillian mien in a bush jacket and a ten-gallon hat from Texas.
From his shoulder bag peeked the seven-inch barrel of a Luger.
The temperature rose to 105-degrees.
With our company of soldiers, we made one long column of reddish dust.
In Keng Kok, the City of Silkworms, the Prime Minister bought fried chickens and fried cicadas, and two notebooks for me.
Then we drove on, until there was no more road and we traversed dry rice fields, bouncing across their squat earth walls.
It was a spleen-crushing day.
An hour of bouncing, a brief stop in a village to inspect a new school or dispensary.
More bouncing, another stop, a new house for teachers, a new well.
Then off again, rushing to keep up.
We were miserable.
But our two Jeep mates -- Keo Viphakone from Luang Prabang and John Cool from Beaver, Pennsylvania -- were beaming under their coatings of dust.
Together they had probably done more than any other men to help push Laos toward the 20th century -- constructively.
Mr. Keo, once a diplomat in Paris and Washington, was Commissioner of Rural Affairs.
John, an engineer and anthropologist with a doctorate from the London School of Economics, headed the rural development division of *j, the United States Operations Mission administering U.*s. aid.
What you see are self-help projects, John said.
We ask the people what they want, and they supply the labor.
We send shovels, cement, nails, and corrugated iron for roofs.
That way they have an infirmary for $400.
We have 2,500 such projects, and they add up to a lot more than just roads and wells and schools.
Ask Mr. Keo.
Mr. Keo agreed.
Our people have been used to accepting things as they found them, he said.
Where there was no road, they lived without one.
Now they learn that men can change their surroundings, through their traditional village elders, without violence.
That's a big step toward a modern state.
You might say we are in the nation-building business.
In the villages people lined up to give us flowers.
Then came coconuts, eggs, and rice wine.
The Prime Minister paid his respects to the Buddhist monks, strode rapidly among the houses, joked with the local soldiery, and made a speech.
The soldiers are fighting and the Americans are helping, he said, but in the fight against the Pathet Lao the key factor is the villager himself.
Then we were off again.
We did it for three days.
But our stumping tour of the south wasn't all misery.
Crossing the 4,000-foot width of the Mekong at Champassak, on a raft with an outboard motor, we took off our dusty shirts and enjoyed a veritable ocean breeze.
Then we hung overboard in the water.
Briefly we rolled over a paved road up to Pak Song, on the cool Bolovens Plateau.
The Prince visited the hospital of Operation Brotherhood, supported by the Junior Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines, and fed rice to two pet elephants he kept at his residence at Pak Song.
Strings keep souls in place in the village of Soukhouma, which means Peaceful, we had a baci.
This is the most endearing of Lao ceremonies.
It takes place in the household, a rite of well-wishing for myriad occasions -- for the traveler, a wedding, a newborn child, the sick, the New Year, for any good purpose.
The preparations were elaborate : flowers, candles, incense sticks, rice wine, dozens of delicacies, and pieces of white cotton string.
The strings were draped around flowers in tall silver bowls ( page 261 ).
The candles were lighted, and we sat on split-bamboo mats among the village notables.
I was careful to keep my feet, the seat of the least worthy spirits, from pointing at anyone's head, where the worthiest spirits reside.
Now a distinguished old man called on nine divinities to come and join us.
Next he addressed himself to our souls.
A man has 32 souls, one for each part of the body.
Those souls like to wander off, and must be called back.
With the divinities present and our souls in place, we were wished health, happiness, and power.
Then, one after another, the villagers tied the waiting cotton strings around our wrists.
These were to be kept on, to hold in the 32 souls.
As we stepped out into the sunlight, a man came up to John Cool and silently showed him his hand.
It had a festering hole as big as a silver dollar.
We could see maggots moving.
John said : I have some antiseptic salve with me, but it's too late for that.
My interviews with teen-agers confirmed this portrait of the weakening of religious and ethnic bonds.
Jewish identity was often confused with social and economic strivings.
Being Jewish gives you tremendous drive, a boy remarked.
It means that you have to get ahead.
When I pressed for a purely religious definition, I encountered the familiar blend of liberal piety, interfaith good will, and a small residue of ethnic loyalty.
I like the tradition, a girl said.
I like to follow the holidays when they come along.
But you don't have to worship in the traditional way.
You can communicate in your own way.
As I see it, there's no real difference between being Jewish, Catholic, or Protestant.
Another teen-ager remarked : most Jews don't believe in God, but they believe in people -- in helping people.
Still another boy asserted : to be a good Jew is to do no wrong ; it's to be a good person.
When asked how this was different from being a good Protestant, the boy answered, it's the same thing.
This accords with the study by Maier and Spinrad.
They discovered that, although 42 per cent of a sample of Catholic students and 15 per cent of the Protestants believed it important to live in accordance with the teachings of their religion, only 8 per cent of the Jewish students had this conviction.
The most important aims of the Jewish students were as follows : to make the world a better place to live in -- 30 per cent ; to get happiness for yourself -- 28 per cent ; and financial independence -- 21 per cent.
Nevertheless, most of the teen-agers I interviewed believed in maintaining their Jewish identity and even envisioned joining a synagogue or temple.
However, they were hostile to Jewish Orthodoxy, professing to believe in Judaism but in a moderate way.
One boy said querulously about Orthodox Jews : it's the twentieth century, and they don't have to wear beards.
The reason offered for clinging to the ancestral faith lacked force and authority even in the teen-agers' minds.
We were brought up that way was one statement which won general assent.
I want to show respect for my parents' religion was the way in which a boy justified his inhabiting a halfway house of Judaism.
Still another suggested that he would join a temple for social reasons, since I'll be living in a suburb.
Intermarriage, which is generally regarded as a threat to Jewish survival, was regarded not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild, clinical disapproval.
Most of the teen-agers I interviewed rejected it on pragmatic grounds.
When you marry, you want to have things in common, a girl said, and it's hard when you don't marry someone with your own background.
A fourteen-year-old girl from the Middle West observed wryly that, in her community, religion inconveniently interfered with religious activities -- at least with the peripheral activities that many middle class Jews now regard as religious.
It appears that an Orthodox girl in the community disrupted plans for an outing sponsored by one of the Jewish service groups because she would not travel on Saturday and, in addition, required kosher food.
Another girl from a relatively large midwestern city described herself as the only Orthodox girl in town.
This is, no doubt, inaccurate, but it does convey how isolated she feels among the vast army of the nonobservant.
The older teens one of the significant things about Jewish culture in the older teen years is that it is largely college-oriented.
Sixty-five per cent of the Jewish teen-agers of college age attend institutions of higher learning.
This is substantially higher than the figures for the American population at large -- 45.6 per cent for males and 29.2 per cent for females.
This may help explain a phenomenon described by a small-town Jewish boy.
In their first two years in high school, Jewish boys in this town make strenuous exertions to win positions on the school teams.
However, in their junior and senior years, they generally forego their athletic pursuits, presumably in the interest of better academic achievement.
It is significant, too, that the older teen-agers I interviewed believed, unlike the younger ones, that Jewish students tend to do better academically than their gentile counterparts.
The percentage of Jewish girls who attend college is almost as high as that of boys.
The motivations for both sexes, to be sure, are different.
The vocational motive is the dominant one for boys, while Jewish girls attend college for social reasons and to become culturally developed.
One of the significant developments in American-*jewish life is that the cultural consumers are largely the women.
It is they who read -- and make -- Jewish best-sellers and then persuade their husbands to read them.
In upper teen Jewish life, the non-college group tends to have a sense of marginality.
People automatically assume that I'm in college, a nineteen-year-old machinist observed irritably.
However, among the girls, there are some morale-enhancing compensations for not going to college.
The Jewish working girl almost invariably works in an office -- in contradistinction to gentile factory workers -- and, buttressed by a respectable income, she is likely to dress better and live more expansively than the college student.
She is even prone to regard the college girl as immature.
The lower-middle class college student one of the reasons for the high percentage of Jewish teen-agers in college is that a great many urban Jews are enabled to attend local colleges at modest cost.
This is particularly true in large centers of Jewish population like New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia.
What is noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers is that, although their attitudes hardly differentiate them from their gentile counterparts, they actually lead their lives in a vast self-enclosed Jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-*jewish world.
Perhaps the Jewish students at Brooklyn College -- constituting 85 per cent of those who attend the day session -- can serve as a paradigm of the urban, lower-middle class Jewish student.
There is, to begin, an important sex difference.
Typically, in a lower-middle class Jewish family, a son will be sent to an out-of-town school, if financial resources warrant it, while the daughter will attend the local college.
There are two reasons for this.
First, the girl's education has a lower priority than the son's.
Second, the attitude in Jewish families is far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son.
Most Jewish mothers are determined to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual lives of their daughters by keeping them home.
The consequence of this is that the girls at Brooklyn College outnumber the boys and do somewhat better academically.
One can assume that some of the brightest boys are out of town.
Brooklyn College students have an ambivalent attitude toward their school.
On the one hand, there is a sense of not having moved beyond the ambiance of their high school.
This is particularly acute for those who attended Midwood High School directly across the street from Brooklyn College.
They have a sense of marginality at being denied that special badge of status, the out-of-town school.
At the same time, there is a good deal of self-congratulation at attending a good college -- they are even inclined to exaggerate its not inconsiderable virtues -- and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feeling that the college generates.
It's people of your own kind, a girl remarked.
You don't have to watch what you say.
Of course, I would like to go to an out-of-town school where there are all kinds of people, but I would want lots of Jewish kids there.
For most Brooklyn College students, college is at once a perpetuation of their ethnic attachments and a breaking away from the cage of neighborhood and family.
Brooklyn College is unequivocally Jewish in tone, and efforts to detribalize the college by bringing in unimpeachably midwestern types on the faculty have been unavailing.
However, a growing intellectual sophistication and the new certitudes imparted by courses in psychology and anthropology make the students increasingly critical of their somewhat provincial and overprotective parents.
And the rebellion of these third generation Jews is not the traditional conflict of culture but, rather, a protest against a culture that they view as softly and insidiously enveloping.
As long as I'm home, I'll never grow up, a nineteen-year-old boy observed sadly.
They don't like it if I do anything away from home.
It's so much trouble, I don't usually bother.
For girls, the overprotection is far more pervasive.
Parents will drive on Friday night to pick up their daughters after a sorority or House Plan meeting.
A freshman girl's father not too long ago called a dean at Brooklyn College and demanded the low-down on a boy who was going out with his daughter.
The domestic tentacles even extend to the choice of a major field.
Under pressure from parents, the majority of Brooklyn College girls major in education since that co-ordinates best with marriage plans -- limited graduate study requirement and convenient working hours.
This means that a great many academically talented girls are discouraged from pursuing graduate work of a more demanding nature.
A kind of double standard exists here for Jewish boys and girls as it does in the realm of sex.
The breaking away from the prison house of Brooklyn is gradual.
First, the student trains on his hapless parents the heavy artillery of his newly acquired psychological and sociological insights.
Then, with the new affluence, there is actually a sallying forth into the wide, wide world beyond the precincts of New York.
It is significant that the Catskills, which used to be the summer playground for older teen-agers, a kind of summer suburb of New York, no longer attracts them in great numbers -- except for those who work there as waiters, bus boys, or counselors in the day camps.
The great world beyond beckons.
But it should be pointed out that some of the new watering places -- Fire Island, Nantucket, Westhampton, Long Island, for example -- tend to be homogeneously Jewish.
Although Brooklyn College does not yet have a junior-year-abroad program, a good number of students spend summers in Europe.
In general, however, the timetable of travel lags considerably behind that of the student at Harvard or Smith.
And acculturation into the world at large is likely to occur for the Brooklyn College student after college rather than during the four school years.
Brooklyn College is Marjorie Morningstar territory, as much as the Bronx or Central Park West.
There are hordes of nubile young women there who, prodded by their impatient mothers, are determined to marry.
It is interesting that, although the percentage of married students is not appreciably higher at Brooklyn than elsewhere -- about 30 per cent of the women and 25 per cent of the men in the graduating class -- the anxiety of the unmarried has puffed up the estimate.
Almost everybody in the senior class is married, students say dogmatically.
And the school newspaper sells space to jubilant fraternities, sororities, and houses ( in the House Plan Association ) that have good news to impart.
These announcements are, in effect, advertisements for themselves as thriving marriage marts.
There are boxed proclamations in the newspaper of watchings, pinnings, ringings, engagements, and marriages in a scrupulously graded hierarchy of felicity.
Witt House happily announces the engagement of Fran Horowitz to Erwin Schwartz of Fife House.
The Brooklyn College student shows some striking departures from prevailing collegiate models.
The Ivy League enjoys no easy dominion here, and the boys are as likely to dress in rather foppish Continental fashion, or even in nondescript working class manner, as they are in the restrained, button-down Ivy way.
The girls are prone to dress far more flamboyantly than their counterparts out of town, and eye shadow, mascara, and elaborate bouffant hairdos -- despite the admonitions of cautious guidance personnel -- are not unknown even in early morning classes.
Among the boys, there is very little bravado about drinking.
Brooklyn College is distinctive for not having an official drinking place.
The Fort Lauderdale encampment for drinking is foreign to most Brooklyn College boys.
This should be used frequently ( but shaken before using ).
For galled breasts, the mother should shave into half a cup of fresh unsalted lard enough white chalk to make a paste.
This could also be used for any other skin irritation.
Or she might place cornstarch in the oven for a short time and then apply this under her breasts.
Female troubles of various kinds do not seem to have been common on the frontier ; at least I have only one remedy for anything of this kind in my collection, one for hastening delayed menstruation.
The sufferer drinks tansy tea.
Bruises, burns, cuts, etc., occurred frequently on the frontier, and folk medicine gave the answers to these problems too.
Bruises and black eyes were relieved by application of raw beefsteak.
( doctors now say that it was not the meat but the coolness of the applications which relieved the pain.
) salted butter was another cure for bruises.
Many people agreed that burns should be treated with bland oily salves or unsalted butter or lard, but one informant told me that a burn should be bathed in salt water ; the burn oozed watery fluid for many days, and finally the healing was completed by bathing it with epsom salts.
Another swore by vinegar baths for burns, and still another recommended salted butter.
Butter salve or butter ointment was used for burns, and for bruises as well.
This was made by putting butter in a pan of water and allowing it to boil ; when it was cool, the fat was skimmed off and bottled.
Cow's milk was another cure for burns, and burns covered with gum arabic or plain mucilage healed quickly.
One man, badly burned about the face and eyes by an arc welding torch, was blinded and could not find a doctor at the time.
A sympathetic friend made poultices of raw potato parings, which she said was the best and quickest way to draw out the heat.
Later the doctor used mineral oil on the burns.
The results were good, but which treatment helped is still not known.
To stop bleeding, cobwebs were applied to cuts and wounds.
One old-timer said to sprinkle sugar on a bleeding cut, even when on a knuckle, if it was made by a rusty tool ; this would stop the flow and also prevent infection.
My lawyer told me that his mother used a similar remedy for cuts and wounds ; she sprinkled common sugar directly on the injury and then bound it loosely with cotton cloth, over which she poured turpentine.
He showed me one of his fingers which had been practically amputated and which his mother had treated ; there is scarcely a scar showing.
Tobacco was common first aid.
A chaw of tobacco put on an open wound was both antiseptic and healing.
Or a thin slice of plug tobacco might be laid on the open wound without chewing.
One old man told me that when he was a boy he was kicked in the head by a fractious mule and had his scalp laid back from the entire front of his head.
His brother ran a mile to get the father ; when they reached the boy, the father sliced a new plug of tobacco, put the scalp back in place, and covered the raw edges with the slices.
Then he put a rag around the dressing to keep it in place.
There was no cleaning or further care, but the wound healed in less than two weeks and showed no scar.
Veronica from the herb garden was also used to stop bleeding, and rue was an antiseptic.
Until quite recently, sterile maggots could be bought to apply to a wound ; they would feed on its surface, leaving it clean so that it could be medically treated.
Tetanus could be avoided by pouring warm turpentine over a wound.
One family bound wounds with bacon or salt pork strips, or, if these were not handy, plain lard.
Another sprinkled sugar on hot coals and held the wounded foot or hand in the smoke.
Rabies were cured or prevented by madstones which the pioneer wore or carried.
In 1872 there were known to be twenty-two in Norton County, and one had been in the family for 200 years.
Another cure for hydrophobia was to suck the wounds, then cauterize them with a hot knife or poker.
While nowadays we recognize the fact that there are many causes for bleeding at the nose, not long ago a nosebleed was simply that, and treatment had little variation.
Since a fall or blow might have caused it, a cold pack was usually first aid.
This might be applied to the top of the nose or the back of the neck, pressed on the upper lip, or inserted into the nostril ( cotton was usually used in this last ).
Nosebleed could be stopped by wrapping a red woolen string about the patient's neck and tying it in a knot for each year of his life.
Or the victim could chew hard on a piece of paper, meanwhile pressing his fingers tight in his ears.
Old sores could be healed by the constant application of a wash made of equal parts vinegar and water.
Blood blisters could be prevented from forming by rubbing a work blister immediately with any hard nonpoisonous substance.
Felons were cured by taking common salt and drying it in the oven, pounding it fine, and mixing it with equal parts of spirits of turpentine ; this mixture was then spread on a cloth and wrapped around the affected part.
As the cloth dried, more of the mixture was applied, and after twenty-four hours the felon was supposed to be killed.
Insect bites were cured in many ways.
Many an old-timer swore by the saliva method ; get a bite, spit on it was a proverb.
This was used also for bruises.
Yellow clay was used as a poultice for insect bites and also for swellings ; not long ago Denver Mud was most popular.
Chiggers were a common pest along streams and where gardens and berries thrived ; so small as to be scarcely visible to the eye, they buried themselves in the victim's flesh.
Bathing the itching parts with kerosene gave relief and also killed the pests.
Ant bites were eased by applying liquid bluing.
For mosquito bites a paste of half a glass of salt and half a glass of soda was made.
For wasp stings onion juice, obtained by scraping an onion, gave quick relief.
A handier remedy was to bathe the painful part in strong soapy water ; mud was sometimes used as well as soap.
Just plain old black dirt was also used as a pack to relieve wasp or bee stings.
Bedbugs were a common pest in pioneer days ; to keep them out of homes, even in the 1900's, was a chore.
Bed slats were washed in alum water, legs of beds were placed in cups of kerosene, and all woodwork was treated liberally with corrosive sublimate, applied with a feather.
Kerosene was very effective in ridding pioneer homes of the pests.
At times pioneer children got lice in their hair.
A kerosene shampoo seems a heroic treatment, but it did the job.
To remove an insect from one's ear warm water should be inserted.
A cinder or other small object could be removed from the eye by placing a flaxseed in the eye.
As the seed swelled its glutinous covering protected the eyeball from irritation, and both the cinder and the seed could soon be washed out.
Another way to remove small objects from the eye was to have the person look cross-eyed ; the particle would then move toward the nose, where it could be wiped out with a wisp of cotton.
Shingles were cured by gentian, an old drug, used in combinations.
For erysipelas a mixture of one dram borax and one ounce glycerine was applied to the afflicted part on linen cloth.
Itching skin, considered just nerves, was eased by treating with whiskey and salt.
Winter itch was treated by applying strong apple cider in which pulverized bloodroot had been steeped.
To cure fungus growths on mouth or hands people made a strong tea by using a handful of sassafras bark in a quart of water.
They drank half a cup of this morning and night, and they also washed and soaked their hands in the same solution.
Six treatments cured one case which lasted a month and had defied other remedies.
Frostbite was treated by putting the feet and hands in ice water or by rubbing them with snow.
Now one hears that heat and hot water are used instead.
Another remedy was oil of eucalyptus, used as well for chilblains.
Chilblains were also treated with tincture of capsicum or cabbage leaves.
Boils have always been a source of much trouble.
A German informant gave me a sure cure made by combining rye flour and molasses into a poultice.
Another poultice was made from the inner bark of the elm tree, steeped in water until it formed a sticky, gummy solution.
This was also used for sores.
Another frequent pioneer difficulty, caused by wearing rough and heavy shoes and boots, was corns.
One veracious woman tells me she has used thin potato parings for both corns and calluses on her feet and they remove the pain or fire.
Another common cure was to soak the feet five or ten minutes in warm water, then to apply a solution of equal parts of soda and common brown soap on a kid bandage overnight.
This softened the skin so that in the morning when the bandage was removed the corn could be scraped off and a bit of corn plaster put on.
There were many cures for warts.
One young girl told me how her mother removed a wart from her finger by soaking a copper penny in vinegar for three days and then painting the finger with the liquid several times.
Another wart removal method was to rub each wart with a bean split open and then to bury the bean halves under the drip of the house for seven days.
Saliva gathered in the mouth after a night's sleep was considered poisonous ; wetting a wart with this saliva on wakening the first thing in the morning was supposed to cause it to disappear after only a few treatments, and strangely enough many warts did just that.
One wart cure was to wrap it in a hair from a blonde gypsy.
Another was to soak raw beef in vinegar for twenty-four hours, tie it on the wart, and wear it for a week.
A simpler method was to tie a thread tightly around the wart at its base and wear it this way.
I know this worked.
One person recommended to me washing the wart with sulphur water ; another said it should be rubbed with a cut potato three times daily.
Another common method was to cut an onion in two and place each half on the wart for a moment ; the onion was then fastened together with string and placed beneath a dripping eave.
As the onion decayed, so did the wart.
Sore muscles were relieved by an arnica rub ; sore feet by calf's-foot, an herb from the pioneer's ubiquitous herb garden, or by soaking the feet in a pan of hot water in which two cups of salt had been dissolved.
Leg cramps, one person tells me, were relieved by standing barefoot with the weight of the body on the heel and pressing down hard.
This does give relief, as I can testify.
One doctor prescribed a tablespoon of whiskey or brandy before each meal for leg cramps.
Pains in the back of the leg and in the abdomen were prevented from reaching the upper body by tying a rope about the patient's waist.
For sprains and swellings, one pint of cider vinegar and half a pint of spirits of turpentine added to three well beaten eggs was said to give speedy relief.
Except for the wine waiter in a restaurant -- always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself, the genii with the keys to unlock the gates of the wine world are one's dealer, and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supplies him.
In instances where both of these are persons or firms with integrity, the situation is ideal.
It may, on occasion, be anything but that.
However, by cultivating a wine dealer and accepting his advice, one will soon enough ascertain whether he has any knowledge of wines ( as opposed to what he may have been told by salesmen and promoters ) and, better yet, whether he has a taste for wine.
Again, by spreading one's purchases over several wine dealers, one becomes familiar with the names and specialties of reputable wine dealers and shippers abroad.
This is important because, despite all the efforts of the French government, an appreciable segment of France's export trade in wines is still tainted with a misrepresentation approaching downright dishonesty, and there are many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas.
A good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which has cornered the wines from the best vineyards, or the best parts of them ; he may also be the one who makes and bottles the best blends -- sound wines from vineyards generally in his own district.
These are the wines the French themselves use for everyday drinking, for even in France virtually no one drinks the Grands Crus on a meal-to-meal basis.
The Grands Crus are expensive, and even doting palates tire of them.
And certainly, in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker, the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the Grands Crus as a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown.
There is nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper.
Some of them are very delicious indeed, and there are many good ones exported -- unfortunately, along with others not so good, and worse.
Consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation -- steering ever from the known to the unknown -- are the requisites.
Wine waiters are something else again ; especially if one is travelling or dining out a great deal, their importance mounts.
Most of them, the world over, operate on the same principle by which justice is administered in France and some other Latin countries : the customer is to be considered guilty of abysmal ignorance until proven otherwise, with the burden of proof on the customer himself.
Now the drinking of wine ( and happily so ] ) is for the most part a recondite affair, for manifestly, if everyone in the world who could afford the best wines also liked them, the supply would dry up in no time at all.
This is the only valid, and extenuating, argument that may be advanced in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter.
A really good wine waiter is, paradoxically, the guardian ( and not the purveyor ) of his cellar against the Visigoths.
Faced, on the one hand, with an always exhaustible supply of his best wines, and on the other by a clientele usually equipped with inexhaustible pocketbooks, it is a wonder indeed that all wine waiters are not afflicted with chronic ambivalence.
The one way to get around them -- short of knowing exactly what one wants and sticking to it -- is to frequent a single establishment until its wine waiter is persuaded that one is at least as interested in wine as in spending money.
Only then, perhaps, will he reveal his jewels and his bargains.
Wine bought from a dealer should ideally be allowed to rest for several weeks before it is served.
This is especially true of red wines, and a practice which, though not always practicable, is well worth the effort.
It does no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of days, but in terms of months and years it is fatal.
Wine stored for a long time should be on its side ; otherwise, the cork dries and air enters to spoil it.
When stacking wine on its side in a bin, care should always be taken to be sure there is no air bubble left next to the cork.
Fat bottles, such as Burgundies, have a way of rolling around in the bin and often need little props, such as a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood, to hold them in the proper reclining posture.
Too much dampness in the cellar rots the corks, again with ill effects.
The best rule of thumb for detecting corked wine ( provided the eye has not already spotted it ) is to smell the wet end of the cork after pulling it : if it smells of wine, the bottle is probably all right ; if it smells of cork, one has grounds for suspicion.
Seasonal rises or drops in temperature are bad for wine : they age it prematurely.
The ideal storage temperature for long periods is about fifty-five degrees, with an allowable range of five degrees above or below this, provided there are no sudden or frequent changes.
Prolonged vibration is also undesirable ; consequently, one's wine closet or cellar should be away from machines or electrically driven furnaces.
If one lives near a subway or an express parkway, the solution is to have one's wines stored with a dealer and brought home a few at a time.
Light, especially daylight, is always bad for wine.
All in all, though, there is a good deal of nonsense expended over the preparations thought necessary for ordinary wine drinking ; many people go to extreme lengths in decanting, chilling or warming, or banishing without further investigation any bottle with so much as a slightly suspicious cork.
No one should wish to deny these purists the obvious pleasure they derive from all this, and to give fair warning where warning is due, no one who becomes fond of wines ever avoids acquiring some degree of purism ] but the fact remains that in most restaurants, including some of the best of Paris and Bordeaux and Dijon, the bottle is frankly and simply brought from the cellar to the table when ordered, and all the conditioning or preparation it ever receives takes place while the chef is preparing the meal.
A white wine, already at cool cellar temperature, may be adequately chilled in a bucket of ice and water or the freezing compartment of a refrigerator ( the former is far preferable ) in about fifteen minutes ; for those who live in a winter climate, there is nothing better than a bucket of water and snow.
Though by no means an ideal procedure, a red wine may similarly be brought from the cellar to the dining room and opened twenty minutes or so before serving time.
It may be a bit cold when poured ; but again, as one will have observed at any restaurant worth its salt, wine should be served in a large, tulip-shaped glass, which is never filled more than half full.
In this way, red wine warms of itself quite rapidly -- and though it is true that it may not attain its potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal ( or the course ), in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interesting stages.
The only cardinal sin which may be committed in warming a wine is to force it by putting it next to the stove or in front of an open fire.
This invariably effaces any wine's character, and drives its fragrance underground.
It should not be forgotten that wines mature fastest in half-bottles, less fast in full bottles, slowly in Magnums -- and slower yet in Tregnums, double Magnums, Jeroboams, Methuselahs, and Imperiales, respectively.
Very old red wines often require several hours of aeration, and any red wine, brought from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime, should be uncorked and allowed some air.
But white wines never ] white wines should be opened when served, having been previously chilled in proportion to their sweetness.
Thus, Sauternes or Barsacs should be very cold ; a Pouilly-*fuisse or a Chablis somewhat less cold.
Over-chilling is an accepted method for covering up the faults of many a cheap or poor white wine, especially a dry wine -- and certainly less of a crime than serving a wine at a temperature which reveals it as unattractive.
The fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a lingering death when it is allowed to warm or is exposed for long to the air.
To quote Professor Saintsbury : the last glass of claret or Burgundy is as good as the first ; but the first glass of Chateau d'*yquem or Montrachet is a great deal better than the last ] this does not mean, though, that a red wine improves with prolonged aeration : there is a reasonable limit -- and wines kept over to the next meal or the next day, after they have once been opened, are never as good.
If this must be done, they should always be corked and kept in a cool place ; it should be remembered that their lasting qualities are appreciably shorter than those of milk.
A few red wines, notably those of the Beaujolais, are better consumed at cellar temperature.
By tradition, a red wine should be served at approximately room temperature -- if anything a little cooler -- and be aged enough for the tannin and acids to have worked out and the sediment have settled well.
Thus, red wine must, if possible, never be disturbed or shaken ; very old red wine is often decanted so that the puckering, bitter elements which have settled to the bottom will not be mingled with the wine itself.
A tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do as much harm as a week at sea.
The cork should be pulled gradually and smoothly, and the lip of the bottle wiped afterward.
Many people use wicker cradles for old red wine, lifting the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table, without disturbing the sediment.
Another school frowns on such a shortcut, and insists that after leaving the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several days to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom, after which the bottle may be gently eased to a tilted position on its side in the cradle.
In France, when one wishes to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wines, one visits the restaurant well ahead of time, chooses the wines and, with the advice of the manager and his chef, builds the menu around them.
The wine waiter will see to it that the bottles are taken from the bin and opened at least in time to warm and aerate, preferably allowed to stand on end for as long as possible and, perhaps in the case of very old wines, be decanted.
Decanting old wine aerates it fully ; it may also be -- practically speaking -- a matter of good economy.
For, in the process of decanting, the bottle is only tilted once instead of several or more times at the table : hence, a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs.
Though there are many exceptions, which we have noted in preceding pages, white wine is as a rule best consumed between two and six years old, and red wines, nowadays, between three and ten.
Red wines of good years tend to mature later and to keep longer ; the average claret is notably longer-lived than its opposite number, red Burgundy.
Some clarets do not come into their own until they are ten or fifteen years of age, or even more.
If a red Bordeaux of a good name and year is bitter or acid, or cloying and muddy-tasting, leave it alone for a while.
Most of the wines of Beaujolais, on the other hand, should be drunk while very young ; and Alsatians may be.
Giffen replied punctually and enthusiastically : rest assured that your accompanying Letter of Instructions shall be in the Letter and Spirit strictly complied with and most particularly in regard to that part of them relative to the completion of your noble and humane views.
Giffen lost no time in visiting the plantation.
The slaves appeared to be in good health and at work under John Palfrey's overseer.
An excellent crop was expected that year.
William, who lived in neighboring St. Mary's parish, had taken charge and decided that it would be best for all if the plantation were operated for another year.
Giffen advised acceptance of this plan, citing the depressed market for land then prevailing and the large stock of provisions at the plantation.
If sold then, the land and improvements might bring only $5,000.
Early in January, 1844 he had a conference with Henry and William in New Orleans, and upon learning of Gorham's intention, Henry remonstrated calmly but firmly with his brother.
The emancipation plan would not only be injurious to all the heirs, he contended, but would be a form of cruelty perpetrated on the hapless Negroes.
They were not capable of supporting themselves off the plantation, and Louisiana law required their removal from the state.
Gorham refused to accept money for slave property, but did he realize how much expense and trouble the transportation of his Negroes to the North involved?
The suggestion that Giffen hire out the slaves was not realistic, since no planter would take the risk of having Negroes who knew they were to be free living with his own slaves.
Henry hid his annoyance, although both he and William were furious with their Yankee brother.
William, who did not write to Gorham, told Giffen that unless he could operate the plantation as usual for a year, he would sue amicably to protect his interests.
Palfrey was determined that his portion of the slaves be converted to wage laborers during the transition period before emancipation.
If William wished to continue operations for a year, why not simply leave the Negroes undisturbed and pay them as high wages to remain there as are ever paid the labor of persons of their sex & age.
A disposition to exert themselves for my benefit would perhaps be a motive with some of them to come into the scheme.
Their having family ties on our plantation & the adjoining one would be a stronger inducement.
When he heard of his brothers' anger, Palfrey was still hopeful that they could be persuaded to accept his notion of paying wages.
If not, he was willing to accede to William's wishes in any way that did not block his ultimate aim.
William was adamant on one point : under no circumstances would he allow the Negroes to remain on the plantation with his and Henry's slaves if they were told of their coming freedom.
Knowing the antipathy that existed in Louisiana against increasing the number of free Negroes, Giffen suggested that Palfrey bring them to Boston at once, and then send them on to Liberia.
Lacking specific instructions, he agreed to William's condition.
In March there was a division of the slaves, and Giffen carried out his instructions as nearly as possible.
Of the fifty-two slaves, Giffen succeeded in getting a lot of twenty, twelve of whom were females.
I considered that your views would be best carried out, he explained, by taking women whose progeny will of course be free & more fully extend the philantrophy of Emancipation.
I have also taken the old servants of your father as a matter of Conscience & Justice.
The ages of the slaves ranged from sixty-five, for an old house servant, to an unnamed newborn child.
If Palfrey ever had any doubts about the wickedness of slavery, they were put aside after he received an inventory of the slave property he had inherited.
This cold reckoning of human worth in a legal paper, devoid of compassion or humanity, was all he needed.
Each human being, known only by a given name, had a cash value.
Old Sam's sixty-five years had reduced his value to $150 ; ; Rose, a twelve-year-old with child-bearing potential, was worth $400.
In rejecting any claim to the value of the slave property, Palfrey was giving up close to $7,000.
Palfrey's brothers each received lots of sixteen Negroes, and for bookkeeping purposes it was agreed that all lots were to be valued at $6,666.66.
Thus twenty black souls were to remain ignorant of their imminent journey to the land of free men.
Giffen extracted one concession from William : the house servants could be free at any time Gorham thought expedient.
Despite Giffen's warning, Palfrey still had plans for freeing his slaves in Louisiana.
Yet even if he could get the necessary approval, fourteen of his Negroes could not be manumitted without special permission.
According to state law a slave had to be at least thirty years old before he could be freed.
Palfrey petitioned the state legislature to waive the requirement.
Otherwise, freedom would mean removal from the state in which as the place of their past residence from birth, or for many years, it would be materially for their advantage to be at liberty to remain.
On March 11 the Louisiana legislature voted unanimously to table the petition.
News of the legislative veto appeared in the New Orleans papers, and Henry and William became incensed by the fact that they had not been told of the attempt in advance.
Henry stormed into Giffen's office waving a copy of the New Orleans Courier, shouting that the emancipation scheme had become a public affair, and that it would reach the Ears of the People on the Plantation, and make them restless & unhappy.
His brothers' anger caused Palfrey genuine concern, for he had imposed a dual mission upon himself : to free his slaves, and to keep the family from falling apart over the issue.
When Giffen decided to charge him interest on the loan from John Palfrey, Gorham readily assented, vowing that in a matter of dollars and cents, his brothers would never have any cause to complain of him.
In view of these difficulties, Palfrey decided to go to Louisiana.
Giffen had already urged him to journey south, if only for a few days to clear up matters.
His duties as Massachusetts Secretary of State obliged him to wait until the adjournment of the legislature in mid-*april.
Palfrey told his wife of his intentions for the first time, and left for New Orleans apprehensively invoking a special blessing of Providence that he might be allowed to see his family again.
During his journey Palfrey stopped off to see two abolitionists.
In both cases he desired information about placing the freedmen in homes once they arrived in the North.
In New York, Lydia Maria Child welcomed him enthusiastically : I have lately heard of you from the Legislature of Louisiana, and felt joy at your public recognition of the brotherhood of man.
Mrs. Child, who had once apologized for sending editor Palfrey a book on slavery, now confided that she had helped one of Henry Palfrey's slaves escape to Canada some years before, but asked him not to advertise the fact in Louisiana.
She agreed to take charge of five or six of the Negroes should Palfrey decide to send them north immediately.
At Lexington, Kentucky, Palfrey consulted with Cassius M. Clay on the same subject, but with no apparent result.
Despite his apprehensions about his personal safety, Palfrey's reception in New Orleans was more than cordial.
Instead of the expected annoyances due to the nature of his mission, he received many calling cards and invitations from gentlemen of mark, on whom I had no sort of claim, & have had many more invitations than I could accept.
He later told abolitionist Edmund Quincy of the marked attention and civility with which the New Orleans gentlemen and the upriver planters greeted him.
The memory of this southern hospitality did not survive the trials of coming antislavery years and Civil War.
Palfrey's autobiography contains a melodramatic account of two perilous days spent among the planters of Attakapas, many of whom were coarse & passionate people, much excited by what they heard of my plans.
He proceeded with his task bravely -- in his memoirs, at least -- before the passions of my neighbors should have time to boil too high.
Palfrey had already made up his mind that he would allow the men, but not the women, to choose freely whether or not to go North for freedom.
The women by remaining behind condemned their children, born and unborn, to bondage.
He had a short private talk with each adult slave.
Only one objected, but Palfrey soon convinced him that he ought to go with the others.
All the slaves joined in requesting that they be allowed to delay their departure until the end of the planting season, so that they could get in their own little produce.
Palfrey agreed ; the slaves were to remain as wage laborers for his account.
William's threat that under no conditions would he allow freedom-conscious slaves to mix with his own was not carried out, for the plantation continued in operation as before.
Palfrey returned to Massachusetts greatly relieved to have made an arrangement so satisfactory to my judgment & my conscience.
From Cambridge, Palfrey maintained a close interest in the welfare of his slaves.
In fact, as the time for their departure approached, his solicitousness increased.
Should any slave change his mind and request to leave earlier, Giffen was to provide passage at once.
When a sailing date of March, 1845 was finally established, Palfrey made sure that the Negroes would have comfortable quarters in New Orleans and aboard ship.
Giffen assured him that the captain and his mate had personally promised to treat the Negroes with consideration.
Palfrey was also concerned about the question of what wage to pay for their labor throughout 1844.
The plantation was sold in January, 1845, and Palfrey thought the new owner ought to pay his people two months' wages.
Giffen suggested fifty dollars as fair compensation for a year's work ; the new owner at Attakapas declined to enter into any philanthropic arrangement.
On March 21, 1845 the bark Bashaw weighed anchor at New Orleans, while on the levee Henry and William Palfrey waved farewell to their father's former chattels who must have looked back at the receding shore with mingled regret and jubilation.
Not all of Palfrey's slaves were aboard the Bashaw.
Giffen had advised that it would not be too difficult to obtain freedom locally for the old house servants.
Two of these were included in Palfrey's lot.
Giffen filed a petition for permission to emancipate four slaves ( all more than fifty years old ) with the St. Martin's Parish Police Jury.
After an initial rejection, which he attributed to a general Excitement against Abolition and Emancipation, Giffen bribed the right individuals on the jury, and got the permission without further delay.
When the Negroes landed at Boston a month later they were, of course, no longer slaves.
Slavery was prohibited in Massachusetts by the terms of the constitution of 1780, which declared all men are born free and equal.
Nevertheless, Palfrey arranged a religious ceremony at King's Chapel to formalize the emancipation.
An eyewitness recalled how awkward the red-turbaned colored women appeared as they curtseyed in the church doorway, and the diffidence the former slaves displayed while they listened to the few words that declared them free.
Once the question of emancipation was settled to Palfrey's satisfaction, he faced a real problem in placing the freedmen in suitable homes as servants.
Palfrey tried fruitlessly to place a Negro boy in the Hopedale Community, but he had better luck in his other attempts.
Mrs. Child, true to her word, helped place Anna and her four children with a Quaker family named Hathaway near Canandaigua, New York.
This group had been Palfrey's greatest worry since Anna was in bad health, and her children were too young to work for their keep.
But certainly the New Frontier has brought to Washington a group more varied in background and interest.
Secretary of State Dean Rusk, a former Rhodes Scholar and Mills College dean, has headed the Rockefeller Foundation and in that role expended large sums for international cultural exchange.
One of his initial acts in office was to appoint Philip Coombs of the Ford Foundation as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Educational and Cultural Affairs.
( in the late forties and fifties, Coombs has declared in defining his role, two strong new arms were added to reinforce United States foreign policy economic assistance and military assistance.
As we embark upon the sixties we have an opportunity to build a third strong arm, aimed at the development of people, at the fuller realization of their creative human potential, and a better understanding among them.
) many of the new appointees are art collectors.
Ambassador-at-*large Averell Harriman has returned to the capital with a collection of paintings that include Renoir, Cezanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, Toulouse-*lautrec, Degas, Matisse, Picasso, and Walt Kuhn.
The Director of the Peace Corps, R. Sargent Shriver, Jr., a Kennedy brother-in-law, collects heavily among the moderns, including Kenzo Okada and Josef Albers.
Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon owns a prize Monet, Femmes dans un Jardin.
Secretary of Defense Robert Mc*namara, former President of the Ford Motor Company, comes from a generation different from that of Eisenhower's own first Secretary of Defense, Charles Wilson, who had been head of General Motors.
Unlike Wilson, who at times seemed almost anti-intellectual in his earthy pragmatism.
Mc*namara is the scholar-businessman.
An inveterate reader of books, he chose while working in Detroit to live in the University community of Ann Arbor, almost forty miles away.
He selected as Comptroller of Defense, not a veteran accountant, but a former Rhodes Scholar, Charles Hitch, who is author of a study on the Economics Of Defense In The Nuclear Age.
One of the President's special assistants, the Harvard dean Mc*george Bundy, was co-author with Henry L. Stimson of the latter's classic memoir, On Active Service.
Another, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., has won a Pulitzer Prize in history ; his wife, Marion, is a portrait painter.
The Press Secretary, Pierre Salinger, was a child prodigy as a pianist.
( it is always of sorrow to me when I find people who neither know nor understand music, he declared not long ago in proposing that White House prizes be awarded for music and art.
) Mrs. Arthur Goldberg, wife of the Secretary of Labor, paints professionally and helps sponsor the Associated Artists' Gallery in the District of Columbia.
( artists are always at a new frontier, she claims.
In fact, the search is almost more important than the find.
) Mrs. Henry Labouisse, wife of the new director of the foreign aid program, is the writer and lecturer Eve Curie.
The list goes on.
At last count, sixteen former Rhodes Scholars ( see box on page 13 ) had been appointed to the Administration, second in number only to its Harvard graduates.
Besides Schlesinger, the Justice Department's Information Director, Edwin Guthman, has won a Pulitzer Prize ( for national reporting ).
Postmaster General J. Edward Day, who must deal with matters of postal censorship, is himself author of a novel, Bartholf Street, albeit one he was obliged to publish at his own expense.
Two men show promise of playing prominent roles : William Walton, a writer-turned-painter, has been a long-time friend of the President.
They arrived in Washington about the same time during the early postwar years : Kennedy as the young Congressman from Massachusetts ; Walton, after a wartime stint with Time-*life, to become bureau chief for The New Republic.
Both lived in Georgetown, were unattached, and shared an active social life.
Walton, who soon made a break from journalism to become one of the capital's leading semi-abstract painters, vows that he and Kennedy never once discussed art in those days.
Nonetheless, they found common interests.
During last year's campaign, Kennedy asked Walton, an utter novice in organization politics, to assist him.
Walton dropped everything to serve as a district co-ordinator in the hard-fought Wisconsin primary and proved so useful that he was promoted to be liaison officer to critically important New York City.
Walton, who served as a correspondent with General James Gavin's paratroopers during the invasion of France, combines the soul of an artist with the lingo of a tough guy.
He provoked outraged editorials when, after a post-*inaugural inspection of the White House with Mrs. Kennedy, he remarked to reporters, we just cased the joint to see what was there.
But his credentials are impeccable.
Already the President and the First Lady have deputized him to advise on matters ranging from the furnishing of the White House to the renovation of Lafayette Square.
A man of great talent, he will continue to serve as a sort of Presidential trouble-shooter, strictly ex officio, for culture.
A more official representative is the Secretary of the Interior.
Udall, who comes from one of the Mormon first-families of Arizona, is a bluff, plain-spoken man with a lust for politics and a habit of landing right in the middle of the fight.
But even while sparring furiously with Republican politicians, he displays a deep and awesome veneration for anyone with cultural attainments.
His private dining room has become a way station for visiting intellectuals such as C. P. Snow, Arnold Toynbee, and Aaron Copland.
Udall argues that Interior affairs should cover a great deal more than dams and wildlife preserves.
After promoting Frost's appearance at the Inauguration, he persuaded the poet to return several months later to give a reading to a select audience of Cabinet members, members of Congress, and other Washington notables gathered in the State Department auditorium.
The event was so successful that the Interior Secretary plans to serve as impresario for similar ones from time to time, hoping thereby to add to the cultural enrichment of the Administration.
His ideas in this respect, however, sometimes arouse critical response.
One tempest was stirred up last March when Udall announced that an eight-and-a-half-foot bronze statue of William Jennings Bryan, sculpted by the late Gutzon Borglum, would be sent on indefinite loan to Salem, Illinois, Bryan's birthplace.
Spokesmen for the nation's tradition-minded sculptors promptly claimed that Udall was exiling the statue because of his own hostility to this art form.
They dug up a speech he had made two years earlier as a Congressman, decrying the more than two hundred statues, monuments, and memorials which dot the Washington landscape as patriotic societies and zealous friends are constantly hatching new plans.
Hoping to cut down on such works, Udall had proposed that a politician be at least fifty years departed before he is memorialized.
He is not likely to win this battle easily.
In the case of the Borglum statue an Interior aide was obliged to announce that there had been a misunderstanding and that the Secretary had no desire to hustle it out of Washington.
The last Congress adopted seven bills for memorials, including one to Taras Shevchenko, the Ukrainian poet laureate ; eleven others were introduced.
Active warfare is raging between the forces pressing for a monument to the first Roosevelt on Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac, and T*r.'s own living children, who wish to preserve the island as a wildlife sanctuary.
The hotly debated plan for the capital's Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial, a circle of huge tablets engraved with his speeches ( and promptly dubbed by one of its critics, Instant Stonehenge ), is another of Udall's headaches, since as supervisor of the National Parks Commission he will share in the responsibility for building it.
Washington, President Kennedy has been heard to remark ironically, is a city of southern efficiency and northern charm.
There have been indications that he hopes to redress that situation, commencing with the White House.
One of Mrs. Kennedy's initial concerns as First Lady was the sad state of the furnishings in a building which is supposed to be a national shrine.
Ever since the fire of 1812 destroyed the beautiful furniture assembled by President Thomas Jefferson, the White House has collected a hodgepodge of period pieces, few of them authentic or aesthetic.
Mrs. Kennedy shows a determination to change all this.
Not long after moving in she turned up a richly carved desk, hewed from the timbers of the British ship H.*m.*s. Resolute and presented to President Hayes by Queen Victoria.
It now serves the President in his oval office.
Later, browsing in an old issue of the Gazette Des Beaux-*arts, she found a description of a handsome gilt pier-table purchased in 1817 by President James Monroe.
She traced it to a storage room.
With its coating of gold radiator paint removed -- a gaucherie of some earlier tenant -- it will now occupy its rightful place in the oval Blue Room on the first floor of the White House.
But it soon became clear that the search for eighteenth-century furniture ( which Mrs. Kennedy feels is the proper period for the White House ) must be pursued in places other than government storage rooms.
The First Lady appointed a Fine Arts Advisory Committee for the White House, to locate authentic pieces as well as to arrange ways to acquire them.
Her effort to put the home of living Presidents on the same basis as Mount Vernon and Monticello recognizes no party lines.
By rough estimate her Committee, headed by Henry Francis Du Pont, contains three times as many Republicans as Democrats.
The press releases emanating from the White House give a clue to the activity within.
A curator has been appointed.
A valuable pencil-and-sepia allegorical drawing of Benjamin Franklin by Jean-*honore Fragonard has been donated by the art dealer Georges Wildenstein and now hangs in the Blue Room.
The American Institute of Interior Designers is redecorating the White House library.
Secretary and Mrs. Dillon have contributed enough pieces of Empire furniture, including Dolley Madison's own sofa, to furnish a room in that style.
And part of a fabulous collection of vermeil hollowware, bequeathed to the White House by the late Mrs. Margaret Thompson Biddle, has been taken out of its locked cases and put on display in the State dining room.
Woman's place is in the home : man must attend to matters of the yard.
One of the vexatious problems to first confront President Kennedy was the property lying just across Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House.
Congress had already appropriated money, and plans were well along to tear down the buildings flanking Lafayette Square and replace them with what one critic calls the marble monumentality of government office buildings.
While a Senator, Kennedy had unsuccessfully pushed a bill to preserve the Belasco Theater, as well as the Dolley Madison and the Benjamin Taylor houses, all scheduled for razing.
What to do about it now that he was President?
Only a few days after moving into the White House.
Kennedy made a midnight inspection of the Square.
Then he called in his friend Walton and turned over the problem to him, with instructions to work out what was best -- provided it didn't pile unnecessary burdens on the President.
The situation involved some political perils.
One of the offices slated for reconstruction is the aged Court of Claims, diagonally across the street from the White House.
Logically, it should be moved downtown.
But Judge Marvin Jones, senior member of the Court, is an elderly gentleman who lives at the nearby Metropolitan Club and desires to walk to work.
More importantly, he also happens to be the brother-in-law of Sam Rayburn, Speaker of the House.
There were aesthetic problems as well as political.
On delving deeper, Walton discovered that most of the buildings fronting the Square could be classified as early nondescript.
The old Belasco Theater, over which many people had grown sentimental, was only a shell of its former self after arduous years as a *j Center.
The Dolley Madison House, Walton concluded, was scarcely worth preserving.
The attempt to save the Square's historic value, he declares, came half a century too late.
Surrounded by ancient elms, the campus is spacious and beautiful.
The buildings are mostly Georgian.
The Dartmouth student does not live in monastic seclusion, as he once did.
But his is still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence, and he must go far, even though he may go fast, for sophisticated pleasures.
He is still heir to the rare gifts of space and silence, if he chooses to be.
He is by no means the country boy he might have been in the last century, down from the hills with bear grease on his hair and a zeal for book learning in his heart.
The men's shops on Hanover's Main Street compare favorably with those in Princeton and New Haven.
And the automobiles that stream out of Hanover each weekend, toward Smith and Wellesley and Mount Holyoke, are no less rakish than those leaving Cambridge or West Philadelphia.
But there has always been an outdoor air to Dartmouth.
The would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment.
No one here pokes fun at manly virtues.
And this gives rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the Ivy League.
It even affects the faculty.
Thus, when Dartmouth's Winter Carnival -- widely recognized as the greatest, wildest, roaringest college weekend anywhere, any time -- was broadcast over a national television hookup, Prexy John Sloan Dickey appeared on the screen in rugged winter garb, topped off by a tam-o'-shanter which he confessed had been acquired from a Smith girl.
President Dickey's golden retriever, frolicking in the snow at his feet, added to the picture of masculine informality.
This carefree disdain for side cropped up again in the same television broadcast.
Dean Thaddeus Seymour, wearing ski clothes, was crowning a beauteous damsel queen of the Carnival.
She must have looked temptingly pretty to the dean as he put the crown on her head.
So he kissed her.
No Dartmouth man was surprised.
Dartmouth students enjoy other unusual diversions with equal sang-froid.
For example, groups regularly canoe down the Connecticut River.
This is in honor of John Ledyard, class of 1773, who scooped a canoe out of a handy tree and first set the course way back in his own student days.
And these hardy travelers are not unappreciated today.
They are hailed by the nation's press, and Smith girls throng the riverbanks at Northampton and refresh the voyageurs with hot soup and kisses.
Dartmouth's favorite and most characteristic recreation is skiing.
Since the days when their two thousand pairs of skis outnumbered those assembled anywhere else in the United States, the students have stopped regarding the Olympic Ski Team as another name for their own.
Yet Dartmouth still is the dominant member of the Intercollegiate Ski Union, which includes the winter sports colleges of Canada as well as those of this country.
Dartmouth students ski everywhere in winter, starting with their own front door.
They can hire a horse and go ski-joring behind him, or move out to Oak Hill, where there's a lift.
The Dartmouth Skiway, at Holt's Ledge, ten miles north of the campus, has one of the best terrains in the East, ranging from novice to expert.
Forty miles farther north is Mount Moosilauke, Dartmouth's own mountain.
Here, at the Ravine Lodge, President Dickey acts as host every year to about a hundred freshmen who are being introduced by the Dartmouth Outing Club to life on the trails.
The Lodge, built of hand-hewn virgin spruce, can handle fifty people for dining, sleeping, or lounging in its huge living room.
The Outing Club also owns a chain of fourteen cabins and several shelters, extending from the Vermont hills, just across the river from the college, through Hanover to the College Grant -- 27,000 acres of wilderness 140 miles north up in the logging country.
The cabins are equipped with bunks, blankets, and cooking equipment and are ideal bases for hikes and skiing trips.
The club runs regular trips to the cabins, but many of the students prefer to take off in small unofficial groups for a weekend of hunting, fishing, climbing, or skiing.
Under the auspices of the Outing Club, Dartmouth also has the Mountaineering Club, which takes on tough climbs like Mount Mc*kinley, and Bait & Bullet, whose interests are self-evident, and even sports a Woodman's Team, which competes with other New England colleges in wood sawing and chopping, canoe races, and the like.
There is much to be said for a college that, while happily attuned to the sophisticated Ivies, still gives its students a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back roads where a glimpse of small game, deer, or even bear is not uncommon.
City boys find a lot of learning in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill, come upon suddenly in a backwoods logging camp.
And on the summit of Mount Washington, where thirty-five degrees below zero is commonplace and the wind velocity has registered higher than anywhere else in the world, there is a kind of wisdom to be found that other men often seek in the Himalayas because it is there.
There is much to be said for such a college -- and Dartmouth men have been accused of saying it too often and too loudly.
Their affection for their college home has even caused President Dickey to comment on this place loyalty as something rather specially Hanoverian.
Probably a lawyer once said it best for all time in the Supreme Court of the United States.
Early in the nineteenth century the State of New Hampshire was casting about for a way to found its own state university.
It fixed on Dartmouth College, which was ready-made and just what the proctor ordered.
The legislators decided to liberate Dartmouth and entered into a tug-o'-war with the college trustees over the control of classrooms, faculty, and chapel.
For a time there were two factions on the campus fighting for possession of the student body.
The struggle was resolved in 1819 in the Supreme Court in one of the most intriguing cases in our judicial history.
In 1817 the lawyers were generally debating the legal inviolability of private contracts and charters.
A lawyer, hired by the college, was arguing specifically for Dartmouth : Daniel Webster, class of 1801, made her plight the dramatic focus of his whole plea.
In an age of oratory, he was the king of orators, and both he himself and Chief Justice Marshall were bathed in manly tears, as Uncle Dan'l reached his thundering climax : it is, sir, as I have said, a small college, and yet there are those who love it.
Dartmouth is today still a small college -- and still a private one, thanks to Webster's eloquence.
This is not out of keeping with its origins, probably the most humble of any in the Ivy group.
Eleazar Wheelock, a Presbyterian minister, founded the school in 1769, naming it after the second earl of Dartmouth, its sponsor and benefactor.
Eleazar, pausing on the Hanover plain, found its great forests and remoteness good and with his own hands built the first College Hall, a log hut dedicated for the education & instruction of youth of the Indian Tribes in this land in reading, writing & all parts of learning which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilizing & christianizing children of pagans as well as in all liberal arts and sciences ; and also of English youth and any others.
It was a hardy undertaking, and Wheelock's was indeed a voice crying in the wilderness.
A road had to be hacked through trackless forests between Hanover and Portsmouth to permit Governor Wentworth and a company of gentlemen to attend the first Dartmouth commencement in 1771.
The governor and his retinue thoughtfully brought with them a glorious silver punchbowl which is still one of the cherished possessions of the college.
The exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent Dartmouth gatherings.
A student orator produced tears from a great number of the learned even before the punch was served.
Then from the branches of a near-by tree an Indian underclassman, disdaining both the platform and the English language, harangued the assemblage in his aboriginal tongue.
Governor Wentworth contributed an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pines, and a barrel of rum was broached.
The cook got drunk, and President Wheelock proved to be a man of broad talents by carving the ox himself.
Future commencements were more decorous perhaps, but the number of graduates increased from the original four at a relatively slow pace.
By the end of the nineteenth century, in 1893, when the Big Three, Columbia, and Penn were populous centers of learning, Dartmouth graduated only sixty-nine.
The dormitories, including the beloved Dartmouth Hall, could barely house two hundred students in Spartan fashion.
Then in 1893 Dr. William Jewett Tucker became president and the college's great awakening began.
He transformed Dartmouth from a small New Hampshire institution into a national college.
By 1907 the number of undergraduates had risen to 1,107.
And at his last commencement, in that year, Dr. Tucker and Dartmouth were honored by the presence of distinguished academic visitors attesting to the new stature of the college.
The presidents of Cornell, Wisconsin, C.*c.*n.*y., Bowdoin, Vermont, Brown, Columbia, Princeton, Yale, and Harvard and the presidents emeritus of Harvard and Michigan were there.
Dartmouth is numerically still a small college today, with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduates.
But it has achieved a cross-section of students from almost all the states, and two-thirds of its undergraduates come from outside New England.
Over 450 different schools are usually represented in each entering class.
Only a dozen or so schools send as many as six students, and there are seldom more than fifteen men in any single delegation.
About two-thirds of the boys now come from public schools.
It is still a college only and not a university ; it is, in fact, the only college in the Ivy group.
However, three distinguished associated graduate schools offer professional curriculums -- the Dartmouth Medical School ( third oldest in the country and founded in 1797 ), the Thayer School of Engineering, and the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration.
All three are purposely kept small, with a current total enrollment of about two hundred.
All three schools coordinate their educational programs with that of the undergraduate college and, like the college proper, place emphasis upon a broad liberal arts course as the proper foundation for specialized study.
Students of the college who are candidates for the A.*b. degree and can satisfy the academic requirements of the medical and business schools, may enter either of these associated schools at the beginning of senior year, thus completing the two-year postgraduate course in one year.
The Thayer School offers a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way, after a boy wins a B.*s. in engineering.
So Dartmouth is moving closer to the others in the Ivy group.
It is still, however, the junior member of the League, if not in years at least in the catching up it has had to do.
It has not been a well-known school for any part of the span the other Ivies have enjoyed.
However much football has been over-emphasized, the public likes to measure its collegiate favorites by the scoreboard, so, while Yale need never give its record a thought again since outscoring its opponents 694 to 0 in the season of 1888, Dartmouth had to wait until its championship team of 1925 for national recognition.
It has come on with a rush in more significant areas.
Today it espouses certain ideas in its curriculum that other institutions might consider somewhat breathtaking.
But Dartmouth preserves its youthful brashness even in its educational attitudes, and, although some of its experiments may still be in the testing stage, they make for lively copy.
President Emeritus Hopkins once proposed to corral an aristocracy of brains in Hanover.
The person who left the buggy there has never been identified.
It was a busy street, conveniently near the shopping center, and unattended horses and wagons were often left at the curbside.
There are, of course, many weaknesses in any case against Emma.
She didn't like her stepmother, but nothing is known to have occurred shortly before the crime that could have caused such a murderous rage.
She had no way of knowing in advance whether an opportunity for murder existed.
She would have been taking more than a fair risk of being seen and recognized during her travels.
If she avoided the train and hired a buggy, the stableman might have recognized her.
If police had checked on her more thoroughly than is indicated, she would be completely eliminated as a suspect.
Uncle John Vinnicum Morse was the immediate popular suspect.
His sudden unannounced appearance at the Borden home was strange in that he did not carry an iota of baggage with him, although he clearly intended to stay overnight, if not longer.
Lizzie stated during the inquest that while her father and uncle were in the sitting room the afternoon before the murders, she had been disturbed by their voices and had closed her door, even though it was a very hot day.
It is evident that Lizzie did not tell everything she overheard between her father and her Uncle Morse.
At that time Jennings had a young law associate named Arthur S. Phillips.
A few years ago, not too long before his death, Phillips revealed in a newspaper story that he had always suspected Morse of the murders.
He said Morse and Borden had quarreled violently in the house that day, information which must have come from Lizzie.
It was obviously the sound of this argument that caused Lizzie to close her door.
The New Bedford Standard-*times has reported Knowlton as saying, long after the trial, that if he only knew what Borden said during his conversation with Morse, he would have convicted somebody.
Notice, Knowlton did not say that he would have obtained a conviction in the trial of Lizzie Borden.
He said he would have convicted somebody.
It is known that Morse did associate with a group of itinerant horse traders who made their headquarters at Westport, a town not far from Fall River.
They were a vagabond lot and considered to be shady and undesirable characters.
Fall River police did go to Westport to see if they could get any information against Morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hired from among these men.
These officers found no incriminating information.
Morse's alibi was not as solid as it seemed.
He said he returned from the visit to his niece on the 11:20 streetcar.
The woman in the house where the niece was staying backed up his story and said she left when he did to shop for her dinner.
Fall River is not a fashionable town.
The dinner hour there was twelve noon.
If this woman had delayed until after 11:20 to start her shopping, she would have had little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that was eaten at dinner in those days.
It is possible that Morse told the woman it was 11:20, but it could have been earlier, since she did serve dinner on time.
Police did make an attempt to check on Morse's alibi.
They interviewed the conductor of the streetcar Morse said he had taken, but the man did not remember Morse as a passenger.
Questioned further, Morse said that there had been four or five priests riding on the same car with him.
The conductor did recall having priests as passengers and this satisfied police, although the conductor also pointed out that in heavily Catholic Fall River there were priests riding on almost every trip the streetcar made, so Morse's statement really proved nothing.
We do know that Morse left the house before nine o'clock.
Bridget testified she saw him leave through the side door.
Morse said Borden let him out and locked the screen door.
From that point on he said he went to the post office and then walked leisurely to where his niece was staying, more than a mile away.
He met nobody he knew on this walk.
There is no accounting of his movements in this long gap of time which covers the early hours when Mrs. Borden was killed.
Morse testified that while he was having breakfast in the dining room, Mrs. Borden told the servant, Bridget, I want you to wash these windows today.
Bridget's testimony was in direct contradiction.
She said it was after she returned from her vomiting spell in the back yard that Mrs. Borden told her to wash the windows.
This was long after Morse had left the house.
Morse's knowledge of what Mrs. Borden told Bridget could indicate that he had returned secretly to the house and was hidden there.
He knew the house fairly well, he had been there on two previous visits during the past three or four months alone.
And despite Knowlton's attempts to show that the house was locked up tighter than a drum, this was not true.
The screen door was unlocked for some ten or fifteen minutes while Bridget was sick in the back.
It was unlocked all the time she was washing windows.
Morse could have returned openly while Bridget was sick in the back yard and gone up to the room he had occupied.
Mrs. Borden would not have been alarmed if she saw Morse with an ax or hatchet in his hand.
He had been to the farm the previous day and he could have said they needed the ax or hatchet at the farm.
Mrs. Borden would have had no reason to disbelieve him and he could have approached close enough to her to swing before she could cry out.
He could have left for Weybosset Street after her murder and made it in plenty of time by using the streetcar.
If he took an earlier streetcar than the 11:20 on his return, he could have arrived at the Borden house shortly after Mr. Borden came home.
With Lizzie in the barn, the screen door unlocked and Bridget upstairs in her attic room, he would have had free and easy access to the house.
With the second murder over, he could have left, hidden the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandoned cistern in the neighborhood.
His unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree, with crowds already gathering in front of the building and Sawyer guarding the side door, was odd.
There was no close examination of his clothes for bloodstains, and certainly no scientific test was made of them.
And for a man who traveled around without any change of clothing, a few more stains on his dark suit may very well have gone unnoticed.
The motive may have been the mysterious quarrel ; there was no financial gain for Morse in the murders.
On the other side of the ledger is the fact that he did see his niece and the woman with whom she was staying.
The time would have been shortly after the murder of Mrs. Borden and they noticed nothing unusual in his behavior.
He said he had promised Mrs. Borden to return in time for dinner and that was close to the time when he did turn up at the Borden house.
What did Pearson say about Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect in his trial-book essay?
He wrote : the police soon ceased to look upon either Bridget or Mr. Morse as in possession of guilty knowledge.
Neither had any interest in the deaths ; indeed, it was probably to Mr. Morse's advantage to have Mr. and Mrs. Borden alive.
Both he and Bridget were exonerated by Lizzie herself.
That was his complete discussion of Bridget Sullivan as a possible suspect.
Although Pearson disbelieved almost everything Lizzie said, and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she did, he happily accepted her statement about Bridget as the whole truth.
He felt nothing further need be said about the servant girl.
The exoneration Pearson speaks of is not an exoneration, but Lizzie's expression of her opinion, as reported in the testimony of Assistant Marshal Fleet.
This officer had asked Lizzie if she suspected her Uncle Morse, and she replied she didn't think he did it because he left the house before the murders and returned after them.
Fleet asked the same question about Bridget, and Lizzie pointed out that as far as she knew Bridget had gone up to her room before her father's murder and came down when she called her.
Lizzie, actually, never named any suspect.
She told police about the prospective tenant she had heard quarreling with her father some weeks before the murders, but she said she thought he was from out of town because she heard him mention something about talking to his partner.
And, much as she detested Hiram Harrington, she also did not accuse him.
At the inquest she was asked specifically whether she knew anybody her father had bad feelings toward, or who had bad feelings toward her father.
She replied, I know of one man that has not been friendly with him.
They have not been friendly for years.
Asked who this was, she named Harrington.
Her statement certainly was true ; the press reported the same facts in using Harrington's interview, but Lizzie did not suggest at the inquest that Harrington was the killer.
When I interviewed Kirby, who as a boy picked up pears in the Borden yard, I asked if anybody else in the household besides Lizzie and Morse had been under any suspicion at the time of the murders.
He said he had not heard of anybody else.
How about Bridget Sullivan?
I inquired.
Oh, she was just the maid there, he replied, waving a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she was.
Kirby was, of course, reflecting the opinion that existed at the time of murders.
Everyone somehow manages to overlook completely the fact that, as far as we know, there were exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murders : Lizzie Borden and Bridget Sullivan.
All the officials on the case seem to have been afflicted with a similar myopia as far as Bridget was concerned, although records in police files contain many reports of servants who have murdered their employers.
True, it is no longer cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction, but we are dealing here with actual people in real life and not imaginary characters and situations.
The actions of Bridget should be examined, since she was there and opportunity did exist, if only to establish her innocence.
There are also other factors that require closer examination.
The legend as it exists in Fall River today always includes the solemn assurance that Bridget returned to Ireland after the trial with a big bundle of cash which Lizzie gave her for keeping her mouth shut.
The people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never troubled to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid changed her testimony on several key points, always to the detriment of Lizzie.
If Bridget did get any bundles of cash, the last person who would have rewarded her for services rendered would have been Lizzie Borden.
Bridget was born in Ireland, one of fourteen children.
She was apparently the pioneer in her family because she had no close relatives in this country at that time.
She worked as a domestic, first in Newport for a year, and then in South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for another year.
She finally settled in Fall River and, after being employed for a time by a Mrs. Reed, was hired by the Bordens.
I have previously described how, during the week of the murder, Bridget spent the first few hot days scrubbing and ironing clothes.
Her father, James Upton, was the Upton mentioned by Hawthorne in the famous introduction to the Scarlet Letter as one of those who came into the old custom house to do business with him as the surveyor of the port.
A gentleman of the old school, Mr. Upton possessed intellectual power, ample means, and withal, was a devoted Christian.
The daughter profited from his interest in scientific and philosophical subjects.
Her mother also was a person of superior mind and broad interests.
There is clear evidence that Lucy from childhood had an unusual mind.
She possessed an observant eye, a retentive memory, and a critical faculty.
When she was nine years old, she wrote a description of a store she had visited.
She named 48 items, and said there were many more things which it would take too long to write.
An essay on Freedom written at 10 years of age quoted the Declaration of Independence, the freedom given to slaves in Canada, and the views of George Washington.
Lucy Upton was graduated from the Salem High School when few colleges, only Oberlin and Elmira, were open to women ; and she had an appetite for learning that could not be denied.
A picture of her in high school comes from a younger schoolmate, Albert S. Flint, friend of her brother Winslow, and later, like Winslow, a noted astronomer.
He recalled Lucy, as a bright-looking black-eyed young lady who came regularly through the boys' study hall to join the class in Greek in the little recitation room beyond.
The study of Greek was the distinctive mark of boys destined to go to college, and Lucy Upton too expected to go to college and take the full classical course offered to men.
The death of her mother in 1865 prevented this.
With four younger children at home, Lucy stepped into her mother's role, and even after the brothers and sisters were grown, she was her father's comfort and stay until he died in 1879.
But even so Lucy could not give up her intellectual pursuits.
When her brother Winslow became a student at Brown University in 1874, she wrote him about a course in history he was taking under Professor Diman : what is Prof. Diman's definition of civilization, and take the world through, is its progress ever onward, or does it retrograde at times?
Do you think I might profitably study some of the history you do, perhaps two weeks behind you.
And that she proceeded to do.
Many years later ( on August 3, 1915 ), Lucy Upton wrote Winslow's daughter soon to be graduated from Smith College : while I love botany which, after dabbling in for years, I studied according to the methods of that day exactly forty years ago in a summer school, it must be fascinating to take up zoology in the way you are doing.
Whatever was the science in the high school course for the time being, that was my favorite study.
Mathematics came next.
Her study of history was persistently pursued.
She read Maitland's Dark Ages, which I enjoyed very much ; La Croix on the Customs of the Middle Ages, 16 chapters of Bryce and liked it more and more ; more chapters of Guizot ; Lecky and Stanley's Eastern Church.
She discussed in her letters to Winslow some of the questions that came to her as she studied alone.
Lucy's correspondence with brother Winslow during his college days was not entirely taken up with academic studies.
She played chess with him by postcard.
Also Lucy and Winslow had a private contest to see which one could make the most words from the letters in importunately.
Who won is not revealed, but Winslow's daughter Eleanor says they got up to 1,212 words.
There was another family interest also.
Winslow had musical talents, as had his father before him.
At different times he served as glee-club and choir leader and as organist.
And it was Lucy Upton who first started the idea of a regular course in Music at Spelman College.
Winslow Upton after graduation from Brown University and two years of graduate study, accepted a position at the Harvard Observatory.
For three years he was connected with the U.*s. Naval Observatory and with the U.*s. Signal Corps ; and after 1883, was professor of astronomy at Brown University.
The six expeditions to study eclipses of the sun, of which he was a member, took him to Colorado, Virginia, and California as well as to the South Pacific and to Russia.
After her father's death, Lucy and her youngest sister lived for a few years with Winslow in Washington, D.*c..
Their house, writes Albert S. Flint, was always a haven of hospitality and good cheer, especially grateful to one like myself far from home.
Lucy was a lively part of the household.
Moreover, she had physical as well as mental vigor.
Winslow, as his daughters Eleanor and Margaret recall, used to characterize her as our iron sister.
There is reason to suppose that Lucy would have made a record as publicly distinguished as her brother had it not been that her mother's death occurred just as she was about to enter college.
As a matter of fact, Albert S. Flint expressed his conviction that her physical strength, her mental power, her lively interest in all objects about her and her readiness to serve her fellow beings would have led her to a distinguished career amongst the noted women of this country.
While in Washington, D.*c., Lucy Upton held positions in the U.*s. Census Office, and in the Pension Bureau.
They were not sufficiently challenging however, and she resigned in 1887, to go to Germany with her brother Winslow and his family while he was there on study.
After the months in Europe, she returned to Boston and became active in church and community life.
What was called an accidental meeting with Miss Packard in Washington turned her attention to Spelman.
Here was a cause she believed in.
After correspondence with Miss Packard and to the joy of Miss Packard and Miss Giles, she came to Atlanta, in the fall of 1888, to help wherever needed, although there was then no money available to pay her a salary.
She served for a number of years without pay beyond her travel and maintenance.
Her students have spoken of the exacting standards of scholarship and of manners and conduct she expected and achieved from the students ; of her great power of discernment ; of her exquisiteness of dress, her well-modulated voice that went straight to the hearts of the hearers ; her great love of flowers and plants and birds ; and her close knowledge of individual students.
She drew on all her resources of mind and heart to help them -- to make them at home in the world ; and as graduates gratefully recall, she drew on her purse as well.
Many a student was able to remain at Spelman, only because of her unobtrusive help.
Under Miss Upton, the work of the year 1909-10 went forward without interruption.
After all, she had come to Spelman Seminary in 1888, and had been since 1891 except for one year, Associate Principal or Dean.
She had taught classes in botany, astronomy ( with the aid of a telescope ), geometry, and psychology.
Miss Upton and Miss Packard, as a matter of fact, had many tastes in common.
Both had eager and inquiring minds ; and both believed that intellectual growth must go hand in hand with the development of sturdy character and Christian zeal.
Both loved the out-of-doors, including mountain climbing and horseback riding.
In 1890 when the trip to Europe and the Holy Land was arranged for Miss Packard, it was Miss Upton who planned the trip, and with rare executive ability bore the brunt of the entire pilgrimage from beginning to end.
So strenuous it was physically, with its days of horseback riding over rough roads that it seems an amazing feat of endurance for both Miss Packard and Miss Upton.
Yet they thrived on it.
At the Fifteenth Anniversary ( 1896 ) as already quoted, Miss Upton projected with force and eloquence the Spelman of the Future as a college of first rank, with expanding and unlimited horizons.
When Dr. Wallace Buttrick, wise in his judgment of people, declined to have the Science Building named for him, he wrote Miss Tapley ( April 7, 1923 ) if you had asked me, I think I would have suggested that you name the building for Miss Upton.
Her services to the School for many years were of a very high character, and I have often thought that one of the buildings should be named for her.
Such were the qualities of the Acting-*president of the Seminary after the death of Miss Giles.
At the meeting of the Board of Trustees, on March 3, 1910, Miss Upton presented the annual report of the President.
She noted that no student had been withdrawn through loss of confidence ; that the enrollment showed an increase of boarding students as was desired ; and that the year's work had gone forward smoothly.
She urged the importance of more thorough preparation for admission.
The raising of the $25,000 Improvement Fund two days before the time limit expired, and the spontaneous praise demonstration held afterward on the campus, were reported as events which had brought happiness to Miss Giles.
With the Fund in hand, the debt on the boilers had been paid ; Rockefeller and Packard Halls had been renovated ; walks laid ; and ground had been broken for the superintendent's home.
Miss Upton spoke gratefully of the response of Spelman graduates and Negro friends in helping to raise the Fund, and their continuing efforts to raise money for greatly needed current expenses.
She spoke also with deep thankfulness of the many individuals and agencies whose interest and efforts through the years had made the work so fruitful in results.
Two bequests were recorded : one of $200 under the will of Mrs. Harriet A. Copp of Los Angeles ; and one of $2,000 under the will of Miss Celia L. Brett of Hamilton, New York, a friend from the early days.
Miss Upton told the Trustees that the death of Miss Giles was the sorest grief the Seminary had ever been called upon to bear.
The daughters of Spelman, she said, had never known or thought of Spelman without her.
The removal of Miss Packard 18 years earlier had caused them great sorrow, but they still had Miss Giles.
Now the school was indeed bereft.
Yet Spelman has strong, deep roots, and will live for the blessing of generations to come.
Miss Mary Jane Packard, Sophia's half-sister, became ill in March, 1910 ; and when school closed, she was unable to travel to Massachusetts.
She remained in Atlanta through June and July ; she died on August sixth.
Before coming on a visit to Spelman in 1885, Miss Mary had been a successful teacher in Worcester, and her position there was held open for her for a considerable period.
But she decided to stay at Spelman.
She helped with teaching as well as office work for a few years -- the catalogues show that she had classes in geography, rhetoric and bookkeeping.
Soon the office work claimed all her time.
She was closely associated with the Founders in all their trials and hardships.
Quiet and energetic, cheerful and calm, she too was a power in the development of the seminary.
Miss Giles always used to refer to her as Sister.
She served as secretary in the Seminary office for 25 years, and was in charge of correspondence, records, and bookkeeping.
The books of the school hold a memorial to her ; and so do the hearts of students and of teachers.
Mary J. Packard, states a Messenger editorial, was efficient, pains-taking, self-effacing, loving, radiating the spirit of her Master.
With infinite patience she responded to every call, no matter at what cost to herself, and to her all went, for she was sure to have the needed information or word of cheer.
In a few school districts one finds a link between school and job.
In those vocational programs organized with Smith-*hughes money, there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other.
In these cases a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program, saving a year because of his vocational courses in grades 11 and 12.
The apprentice program will involve further education on a part-time basis, usually at night, perhaps using some of the same equipment of the high school.
These opportunities are to be found in certain cities in such crafts as auto mechanics, carpentry, drafting, electrical work, tool-and-die work, and sheet-metal work.
Formally organized vocational programs supported by federal funds allow high school students to gain experience in a field of work which is likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation.
The diversified occupations program is a part-time trade-preparatory program conducted over two school years on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employers.
The distributive education program operates in a similar way, with arrangements between the school and employers in merchandising fields.
In both cases the student attends school half-time and works in a regular job the other half.
He receives remuneration for his work.
In a few places cooperative programs between schools and employers in clerical work have shown the same possibilities for allowing the student, while still in school, to develop skills which are immediately marketable upon graduation.
Adult education courses, work-study programs of various sorts -- these are all evidence of a continuing interest of the schools in furthering educational opportunities for out-of-school youth.
In general, however, it may be said that when a boy or a girl leaves the high school, the school authorities play little or no part in the decision of what happens next.
If the student drops out of high school, the break with the school is even more complete.
When there is employment opportunity for youth, this arrangement -- or lack of arrangement -- works out quite well.
Indeed, in some periods of our history and in some neighborhoods the job opportunities have been so good that undoubtedly a great many boys who were potential members of the professions quit school at an early age and went to work.
Statistically this has represented a loss to the nation, although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have been a wise one.
I make no attempt to measure the enduring satisfaction and material well-being of a man who went to work on graduation from high school and was highly successful in the business which he entered.
He may or may not be better off than his classmate who went on to a college and professional school.
But in the next decades the nation needs to educate for the professions all the potential professional talent.
In a later chapter dealing with the suburban school, I shall discuss the importance of arranging a program for the academically talented and highly gifted youth in any high school where he is found.
In the Negro neighborhoods and also to some extent in the mixed neighborhoods the problem may be one of identification and motivation.
High motivation towards higher education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reaches grade 9 he or she has at least developed those basic skills which are essential for academic work.
Undoubtedly far more can be done in the lower grades in this regard in the Negro schools.
However, the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family is anti-intellectual.
And the fact remains that there are today few shining examples of Negroes in positions of intellectual leadership.
This is not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the Northern universities.
Quite the contrary, as I can testify from personal experience as a former university president.
Rather we see here another vicious circle.
The absence of successful Negroes in the world of scholarship and science has tended to tamp down enthusiasm among Negro youth for academic careers.
I believe the situation is improving, but the success stories need to be heavily publicized.
Here again we run into the roadblock that Negroes do not like to be designated as Negroes in the press.
How can the vicious circle be broken?
This is a problem to which leaders of opinion, both Negro and white, should devote far more attention.
It is at least as important as the more dramatic attempts to break down barriers of inequality in the South.
Vocational education I should like to underline four points I made in my first report with respect to vocational education.
First and foremost, vocational courses should not replace courses which are essential parts of the required academic program for graduation.
Second, vocational courses should be provided in grades 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student's time in those years ; however, for slow learners and prospective dropouts these courses ought to begin earlier.
Third, the significance of the vocational courses is that those enrolled are keenly interested in the work ; they realize the relevance of what they are learning to their future careers, and this sense of purpose is carried over to the academic courses which they are studying at the same time.
Fourth, the type of vocational training programs should be related to the employment opportunities in the general locality.
This last point is important because if high school pupils are aware that few, if any, graduates who have chosen a certain vocational program have obtained a job as a consequence of the training, the whole idea of relevance disappears.
Vocational training which holds no hope that the skill developed will be in fact a marketable skill becomes just another school chore for those whose interest in their studies has begun to falter.
Those who, because of population mobility and the reputed desire of employers to train their own employees, would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skills ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience.
I have been using the word vocational as a layman would at first sight think it should be used.
I intend to include under the term all the practical courses open to boys and girls.
These courses develop skills other than those we think of when we use the adjective academic.
Practically all of these practical skills are of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtained in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill.
They are in this sense skills marketable immediately on graduation from high school.
To be sure, in tool-and-die work and in the building trades, the first job must be often on an apprentice basis, but two years of half-time vocational training enables the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status.
Similarly, a girl who graduates with a good working knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machines and who is able to get a job at once may wish to improve her skill and knowledge by a year or two of further study in a community college or secretarial school.
Of course, it can be argued that an ability to write English correctly and with some degree of elegance is a marketable skill.
So, too, is the mathematical competence of a college graduate who has majored in mathematics.
In a sense almost all high school and college courses could be considered as vocational to the extent that later in life the student in his vocation ( which may be a profession ) will be called upon to use some of the skills developed and the competence obtained.
In spite of the shading of one type of course into another, I believe it is useful to talk about vocational courses as apart from academic courses.
Perhaps a course in typewriting might be regarded as the exception which proves the rule.
Today many college bound students try to take a course in personal typing, as they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill is almost essential for one who proposes to do academic work in college and a professional school.
Most of our largest cities have one or more separate vocational or technical high schools.
In this respect, public education in the large cities differs from education in the smaller cities and consolidated school districts.
The neighborhood high schools are not, strictly speaking, comprehensive schools, because some of the boys and girls may be attending a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school.
Indeed, one school superintendent in a large city objects to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high schools in his city, because these schools do not offer strictly vocational programs.
He prefers to designate such schools as high schools.
The suburban high school, it is worth noting, also is not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational programs.
The reason is that there is a lack of interest on the part of the community.
Therefore employment and education in all the schools in a metropolitan area are related in different ways from those which are characteristic of the comprehensive high school described in my first report.
The separate vocational or technical high schools in the large cities must be reckoned as permanent institutions.
By and large their programs are satisfactorily connected both to the employment situation and to the realities of the apprentice system.
It is not often realized to what degree certain trades are in many communities closed areas of employment, except for a lucky few.
One has to talk confidentially with some of the directors of vocational high schools to realize that a boy cannot just say, I want to be a plumber, and then, by doing good work, find a job.
It is far more difficult in many communities to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involves union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation.
Two stories will illustrate what I have in mind.
One vocational instructor in a city vocational school, speaking of his course in a certain field, said he had no difficulty placing all students in jobs outside of the city.
In the city, he said, the waiting list for those who want to join the union is so long that unless a boy has an inside track he can't get in.
In a far distant part of the United States, I was talking to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade was doing special work.
What does he have in mind to do when he graduates?
Oh, he'll be a plumber, came the answer.
But isn't it almost impossible to get into the union?
I asked.
He'll have no difficulty, I was told.
He has very good connections.
In my view, there should be a school which offers significant vocational programs for boys within easy reach of every family in a city.
Ideally these schools should be so located that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical courses is at the highest.
An excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school is the Dunbar Vocational High School in Chicago.
Located in a bad slum area now undergoing redevelopment, this school and its program are especially tailored to the vocational aims of its students.
Hardly a window has been broken since Dunbar first was opened ( and vandalism in schools is a major problem in many slum areas ).
I discovered in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupils were Negroes.
They were learning trades as diverse as shoe repairing, bricklaying, carpentry, cabinet making, auto mechanics, and airplane mechanics.
The physical facilities at Dunbar are impressive, but more impressive is the attitude of the pupils.
The soybean seed is the most important leguminous food in the world.
In the United States, where half of the world crop is grown, soybeans are processed for their edible oil.
The residue from soybean processing goes mainly into animal feeds.
Soybeans are extensively processed into a remarkable number of food products in the Orient.
American chemists, seeking to increase exports of soybeans, have adapted modern techniques and fermentation methods to improve their use in such traditional Japanese foods as tofu and miso and in tempeh of Indonesia.
Soybean flour, grits, flakes, milk, and curd can be bought in the United States.
Peanuts are the world's second most important legume.
They are used mainly for their oil.
We produce peanut oil, but to a much greater extent we eat the entire seed.
Blanched peanuts, as prepared for making peanut butter or for eating as nuts, are roasted seeds whose seedcoats have been rubbed off.
Cereal grains, supplemented with soybeans or dry edible peas or beans, comprise about two-thirds or three-fourths of the diet in parts of Asia and Africa.
In western Europe and North America, where the level of economic development is higher, grains and other seed products furnish less than one-third of the food consumed.
Rather, meat and potatoes, sugar, and dairy products are the main sources of carbohydrate, protein, oils, and fats.
People depend less on seeds for foods in Australia, New Zealand, and Argentina, where extensive grazing lands support sheep or cattle, and the consumption of meat is high.
Feeds for livestock took about one-sixth of the world's cereal crop in 1957-1958.
Most of the grain is fed to swine and dairy cows and lesser amounts to beef cattle and poultry.
About 90 percent of the corn used in the United States is fed to animals.
The rest is used for human food and industrial products.
More than half of the sorghum and barley seeds we produce and most of the byproducts of the milling of cereals and the crushing of oilseeds are fed to livestock.
More than 200 million tons of seeds and seed products are fed to livestock annually in the United States.
The efficiency with which animals convert grains and forages to meat has risen steadily in the United States since the 1930's and has paralleled the increased feeding of the cake and meal that are a byproduct when seeds are processed for oil.
The demand for food is so great in the world that little arable land can be given over to growing the nonfood crops.
Seeds grown for industrial uses hold a relatively minor position.
Chief among the seed crops grown primarily for industrial uses are the oil-bearing seeds -- flax, castor, tung ( nuts from the China wood-oil tree ), perilla ( from an Oriental mint ), and oiticica ( from a Brazilian tree ).
Oils, or liquid fats, from the seeds of flax and tung have long been the principal constituents of paints and varnishes for protecting and beautifying the surfaces of wood and metal.
These oils develop hard, smooth films when they dry and form resinlike substances.
The artist who paints in oil uses drying oils to carry the pigments and to protect his finished work for the ages.
One of the finest of artists' oils comes from poppy seeds.
Seeds of soybean, cotton, corn, sesame, and rape yield semidrying oils.
Some are used in paints along with drying oils.
Palm oil protects the surfaces of steel sheets before they are plated with tin.
Castor oil, made from castorbeans, has gone out of style as a medicine.
This nondrying oil, however, is now more in demand than ever before as a fine lubricant, as a constituent of fluids for hydraulically operated equipment, and as a source of chemicals to make plastics.
Almond oil, another nondrying oil, was once used extensively in perfumery to extract flower fragrances.
It is still used in drugs and cosmetics, but it is rather scarce and sometimes is adulterated with oils from peach and plum seeds.
Liquid fats from all these oilseeds enter into the manufacture of soaps for industry and the household and of glycerin for such industrial uses as making explosives.
Sizable amounts of soybean, coconut, and palm kernel oil -- seed oils that are produced primarily for food purposes -- also are used to make soaps, detergents, and paint resins.
Solid fats from the seeds of the mahua tree, the shea tree, and the coconut palm are used to make candles in tropical countries.
Seeds are a main source of starch for industrial and food use in many parts of the world.
Corn and wheat supply most of the starch in the United States, Canada, and Australia.
In other countries where cereal grains are not among the principal crops of a region, starchy tubers or roots are processed for starch.
Starch is used in the paper, textile, and food-processing industries and in a multitude of other manufacturing operations.
Gums were extracted from quince, psyllium ( fleawort ), flax, and locust ( carob ) seeds in ancient times.
Today the yearly import into the United States of locust bean gum is more than 15 million pounds ; of psyllium seed, more than 2.6 million.
The discovery during the Second World War that guar gum was similar to imported locust gum increased its cultivation in western Asia and initiated it in the United States.
Water-soluble gums are used in foods and drugs and in the manufacture of pulp and paper as thickeners, stabilizers, or dispersing agents.
Guar gum thickens salad dressings and stabilizes ice cream.
Quince seed gum is the main ingredient in wave-setting lotions.
Once regarded as an agricultural nuisance, psyllium was sold in the 1930's as a mechanical laxative under 117 different brands.
Locust gum is added to pulp slurries to break up the lumps of fibers in making paper.
The seeds of hard, fibrous, stony fruits, called nuts, provide highly concentrated foods, oils, and other materials of value.
Most nuts consist of the richly packaged storage kernel and its thick, adherent, brown covering -- the seedcoat.
The kernels of brazil nuts, cashews, coconuts, filberts, hazelnuts, hickory nuts, pecans, walnuts, and pine nuts are predominantly oily.
Almonds and pistachio nuts are not so high in oil but are rich in protein.
Chestnuts are starchy.
All nut kernels are rich in protein.
The world production of familiar seed nuts -- almonds, brazil nuts, filberts, and the English walnuts -- totals about 300 thousand tons annually.
Coconuts, the fruit of the coconut palm, have the largest of all known seeds and are grown in South Pacific islands as a crop for domestic and export markets.
The oil palm of West Africa yields edible oil from both the flesh and the seed or kernel of its fruit.
World production of copra, the oil-bearing flesh of the coconut, was a little more than 3 million tons in 1959.
Exports from producing countries in terms of equivalent oil were a little more than 1 million tons, about half of which was palm kernels or oil from them and about half was palm oil.
Other nuts consumed in lesser quantity include the spicy nutmeg ; the soap nut, which owes its sudsing power to natural saponins ; the marking nut, used for ink and varnish ; the aromatic sassafras nut of South America ; and the sweet-smelling cumara nut, which is suited for perfumes.
A forest crop that has not been extensively cultivated is ivory nuts from the tagua palm.
The so-called vegetable ivory is the hard endosperm of the egg-sized seed.
It is used for making buttons and other small, hard objects of turnery.
Seeds of the sago palm are used in Bermuda to make heads and faces of dolls sold to tourists.
The color and shape of seeds have long made them attractive for ornaments and decorations.
Since Biblical times, rosaries have been made from jobs-tears -- the seeds of an Asiatic grass.
Bead tree seeds are the necklaces of South Pacific islanders and the eyes of Buddha dolls in Cuba.
Victorian ladies had a fad of stringing unusual seeds to wear as jewelry.
Handmade Christmas wreaths and trees often contain a variety of seeds collected during the year.
Tradition has assigned medicinal values to seeds because of their alkaloids, aromatic oils, and highly flavored components.
Although science has given us more effective materials, preparations from anise, castorbean, colchicum, nux vomica, mustard, fennel, and stramonium are familiar to many for the relief of human ailments.
Flaxseed poultices and mustard plasters still are used by some persons.
Peanut and sesame oils often are used as carriers or diluents for medicines administered by injection.
Still another group of seeds ( sometimes tiny, dry, seed-bearing fruits ) provide distinctive flavors and odors to foods, although the nutrients they supply are quite negligible.
The common spices, flavorings, and condiments make up this group.
Each year millions of pounds of anise, caraway, mustard, celery, and coriander and the oils extracted from them are imported.
Single-seeded dry fruits used for flavoring include several of the carrot family, such as cumin, dill, fennel, and angelica.
Less common seeds used in cooking and beverages include fenugreek ( artificial maple flavor ) and cardamom.
White pepper is the ground seed of the common black pepper fruit.
Sesame seed, which comes from the tall pods of a plant grown in Egypt, Brazil, and Central America, has a toasted-nut flavor and can be used in almost any dish calling for almonds.
It is a main flavoring for halvah, the candy of the Middle East.
Sesame sticks, a snack dip, originated in the Southwest.
Beverages are made from seeds the world over.
Coffee is made from the roasted and ground seeds of the coffee tree.
World production of coffee broke all previous records in 1959 and 1960 at more than 5 million tons.
Per capita consumption remains around 16 pounds in the United States.
Cocoa, chocolate, and cocoa butter come from the ground seeds of the cacao tree.
World production of about 1 million tons is divided primarily between Africa ( 63 percent ) and South America ( 27 percent ).
Several soft drinks contain extracts from kola nuts, the seed of the kola tree cultivated in the West Indies and South America.
Cereal grains have been used for centuries to prepare fermented beverages.
The Japanese sake is wine fermented from rice grain.
Arrack is distilled from fermented rice in India.
Beer, generally fermented from barley, is an old alcoholic beverage.
Beer was brewed by the Babylonians and Egyptians more than 6 thousand years ago.
Brewers today use corn, rice, and malted barley.
Distillers use corn, malt, wheat, grain sorghum, and rye in making beverage alcohol.
Seed crops hold a prominent place in the agricultural economy of the United States.
The farm value of seeds produced in this country for all purposes, including the cereals, is nearly 10 billion dollars a year.
Cereal grains, oilseeds, and dry beans and peas account for about 57 percent of the farm value of all crops raised.
The economic importance of seed crops actually is even greater, because additional returns are obtained from most of the corn, oats, barley, and sorghum -- as well as the cake and meal from the processing of flaxseed, cottonseed, and soybeans -- through conversion to poultry, meat, and dairy products.
Seeds furnish about 40 percent of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock.
Hay and pasture are the other chief sources of livestock feed.
Seeds are the essential raw materials for milling grain, baking, crushing oilseed, refining edible oil, brewing, distilling, and mixing feed.
More than 11 thousand business establishments in the United States were based on cereals and oilseeds in 1954.
The value of products from these industries was 15.8 billion dollars, of which about one-third was created by manufacturing processes.
Not included was the value of seed oil in paints and varnishes or the value of the coffee and chocolate industries that are based on imported seed or seed products.
Cereal grains furnish about one-fourth of the total food calories in the American diet and about one-third of the total nutrients consumed by all livestock and poultry.
To hold a herd of cattle on a new range till they felt at home was called locatin' 'em.
To keep 'em scattered somewhat and yet herd 'em was called loose herdin'.
To hold 'em in a compact mass was close herdin'.
Cattle were inclined to remain in a territory with which they were acquainted.
That became their home range.
Yet there were always some that moved farther and farther out, seekin' grass and water.
These became strays, the term bein' restricted to cattle, however, as hosses, under like circumstances, were spoken of as stray hosses, not merely strays.
Cattle would drift day and night in a blizzard till it was over.
You couldn't stop 'em ; you had to go with 'em or wait till the storm was over, and follow.
Such marchin' in wholesale numbers was called a drift, or winter drift, and if the storm was prolonged it usually resulted in one of the tragedies of the range.
The cowboy made a technical distinction in reference to the number of them animals.
The single animal or a small bunch were referred to as strays ; but when a large number were bunched up or banded up, and marched away from their home range, as long as they stayed together the group was said to be a drift.
Drifts usually occurred in winter in an effort to escape the severe cold winds, but it could also occur in summer as the result of lack of water or grass because of a drought, or as an aftermath of a stampede.
Drifts usually happened only with cattle, for hosses had 'nough sense to avoid 'em, and to find shelter for 'emselves.
The wholesale death of cattle as a result of blizzards, and sometimes droughts, over a wide range of territory was called a die-up.
Followin' such an event there was usually a harvest of fallen hides, and the ranchers needed skinnin' knives instead of brandin' irons.
Cattle were said to be potted when blizzard choked, that is, caught in a corner or a draw, or against a drift fence durin' a storm.
Cattle which died from them winter storms were referred to as the winter kill.
When cattle in winter stopped and humped their backs up they were said to bow up.
This term was also used by the cowboy in the sense of a human showin' fight, as one cowhand was heard to say, he arches his back like a mule in a hailstorm.
Cattle drove to the northern ranges and held for two winters to mature 'em into prime beef were said to be double wintered.
Cattle brought into a range from a distance were called immigrants.
Them new to the country were referred to as pilgrims.
This word was first applied to the imported hot-blooded cattle, but later was more commonly used as reference to a human tenderfoot.
Hereford cattle were often called white faces, or open-face cattle, and the old-time cowman gave the name of hothouse stock to them newly introduced cattle.
Because Holstein cattle weren't a beef breed, they were rarely seen on a ranch, though one might be found now and then for the milk supply.
The cowboy called this breed of cattle magpies.
A cattaloe was a hybrid offspring of buffalo and cattle.
Dry stock denoted, regardless of age or sex, such bovines as were givin' no milk.
A wet herd was a herd of cattle made up entirely of cows, while wet stuff referred to cows givin' milk.
The cowboy's humorous name for a cow givin' milk was a milk pitcher.
Cows givin' no milk were knowed as strippers.
The terminology of the range, in speakin' of dry stock and wet stock, was confusin' to the tenderfoot.
The most common reference to wet stock was with the meanin' that such animals had been smuggled across the Rio Grande after bein' stolen from their rightful owners.
The term soon became used and applied to all stolen animals.
Mixed herd meant a herd of mixed sexes, while a straight steer herd was one composed entirely of steers, and when the cowman spoke of mixed cattle, he meant cattle of various grades, ages, and sexes.
In the spring when penned cattle were turned out to grass, this was spoken of as turn-out time, or put to grass.
Shootin' 'em out was gettin' cattle out of a corral onto the range.
When a cow came out of a corral in a crouchin' run she was said to come out a-stoopin'.
To stir cattle up and get 'em heated and excited was to mustard the cattle, and the act was called ginnin' 'em 'round, or chousin' 'em.
After a roundup the pushin' of stray cattle of outside brands toward their home range was called throwin' over.
A cow rose from the ground rear end first.
By the time her hindquarters were in a standin' position, her knees were on the ground in a prayin' attitude.
It was when she was in this position that the name prayin' cow was suggested to the cowboy.
They were said to be on their heads when grazin'.
On the hoof was a reference to live cattle and was also used in referrin' to cattle travelin' by trail under their own power as against goin' by rail.
Shippin' cattle by train was called a stock run.
A general classification given grass-fed cattle was grassers.
When a cowboy spoke of dustin' a cow, he meant that he throwed dust into her eyes.
The cow, unlike a bull or steer, kept her eyes open and her mind on her business when chargin', and a cow on the prod or on the peck was feared by the cowhand more than any of his other charges.
The Injun's name for beef was wohaw, and many of the old frontiersmen adopted it from their association with the Injun on the trails.
The first cattle the Injuns saw under the white man's control were the ox teams of the early freighters.
Listenin' with wonder at the strange words of the bullwhackers as they shouted whoa, haw, and Gee, they thought them words the names of the animals, and began callin' cattle wohaws.
Rarely did a trail herd pass through the Injun country on its march north that it wasn't stopped to receive demand for wohaw.
Tailin' was the throwin' of an animal by the tail in lieu of a rope.
Any animal could when travelin' fast, be sent heels over head by the simple process of overtakin' the brute, seizin' its tail, and givin' the latter a pull to one side.
This throwed the animal off balance, and over it'd crash onto its head and shoulders.
Though the slightest yank was frequently capable of producin' results, many men assured success through a turn of the tail 'bout the saddle horn, supplemented sometimes, in the case of cattle, by a downward heave of the rider's leg upon the strainin' tail.
Such tactics were resorted to frequently with the unmanageable longhorns, and a thorough tailin' usually knocked the breath out of a steer, and so dazed 'im that he'd behave for the rest of the day.
It required both a quick and swift hoss and a darin' rider.
When cattle became more valuable, ranch owners frowned upon this practice and it was discontinued, at least when the boss was 'round.
When the cowboy used the word tailin's, he meant stragglers.
Bull tailin' was a game once pop'lar with the Mexican cowboys of Texas.
From a pen of wild bulls one would be released, and with much yellin' a cowhand'd take after 'im.
Seizin' the bull by the tail, he rushed his hoss forward and a little to one side, throwin' the bull off balance, and bustin' 'im with terrific force.
Rammin' one horn of a downed steer into the ground to hold 'im down was called peggin'.
Colors of cattle came in for their special names.
An animal covered with splotches or spots of different colors was called a brindle or brockle.
A lineback was an animal with a stripe of different color from the rest of its body runnin' down its back, while a lobo stripe was the white, yeller, or brown stripe runnin' down the back, from neck to tail, a characteristic of many Spanish cattle.
A mealynose was a cow or steer of the longhorn type, with lines and dots of a color lighter'n the rest of its body 'round the eyes, face, and nose.
Such an animal was said to be mealynosed.
Sabinas was a Spanish word used to describe cattle of red and white peppered and splotched colorin'.
The northern cowboy called all the red Mexican cattle which went up the trail Sonora reds, while they called all cattle drove up from Mexico yaks, because they came from the Yaqui Injun country, or gave 'em the name of Mexican buckskins.
Near the southern border, cattle of the early longhorn breed whose coloration was black with a lineback, with white speckles frequently appearin' on the sides and belly, were called zorrillas.
This word was from the Spanish, meanin' polecat.
Yeller bellies were cattle of Mexican breed splotched on flank and belly with yellerish color.
An animal with distinct coloration, or other marks easily distinguished and remembered by the owner and his riders, was sometimes used as a marker.
Such an animal has frequently been the downfall of the rustler.
Countin' each grazin' bunch of cattle where it was found on the range and driftin' it back so that it didn't mix with the uncounted cattle was called a range count.
The countin' of cattle in a pasture without throwin' 'em together for the purpose was called a pasture count.
The counters rode through the pasture countin' each bunch of grazin' cattle, and drifted it back so that it didn't get mixed with the uncounted cattle ahead.
This method of countin' was usually done at the request, and in the presence, of a representative of the bank that held the papers against the herd.
Them notes and mortgages were spoken of as cattle paper.
A book count was the sellin' of cattle by the books, commonly resorted to in the early days, sometimes much to the profit of the seller.
This led to the famous sayin' in the Northwest of the books won't freeze.
This became a common byword durin' the boom days when Eastern and foreign capital were so eager to buy cattle interests.
The origin of this sayin' was credited to a saloonkeeper by the name of Luke Murrin.
His saloon was a meetin' place for influential Wyoming cattlemen, and one year durin' a severe blizzard, when his herd-owner customers were wearin' long faces, he said, cheer up, boys, whatever happens, the books won't freeze.
In this carefree sentence he summed up the essence of the prevailin' custom of buyin' by book count, and created a sayin' which has survived through the years.
Range delivery meant that the buyer, after examinin' the seller's ranch records and considerin' his rep'tation for truthfulness, paid for what the seller claimed to own, then rode out and tried to find it.
When a cowhand said that a man had good cow sense, he meant to pay 'im a high compliment.
No matter by what name cattle were called, there was no denyin' that they not only saved Texas from financial ruin, but went far toward redeemin' from a wilderness vast territories of the Northwest.
21 swingin' a wide loop the first use of the word rustler was as a synonym for hustler, becomin' an established term for any person who was active, pushin', and bustlin' in any enterprise.
Again it was used as the title for the hoss wrangler, and when the order was given to go out and rustle the hosses, it meant for 'im to go out and herd 'em in.
Eventually herdin' the hosses was spoken of as hoss rustlin', and the wrangler was called the hoss rustler.
Later, the word became almost exclusively applied to a cow thief, startin' from the days of the maverick when cowhands were paid by their employers to get out and rustle a few mavericks.
It was John who found the lion tracks.
He found them near the carcass of a zebra that had been killed the night before, and he circled once, nose to the ground, hair shooting up along his back, as it did when he was after lion or bear, and then he lifted his head and bayed, and the pack joined in, all heads high, and Jones knew it was a hot trail.
He stifled the Comanche yell and let John lead him straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain.
This mountain was known as The Black Reef and it rose almost perpendicularly for about two hundred feet, honeycombed with caves, top covered with dense scrub and creepers and tall grass.
On the south it ended sharply as though the lava had been cut off there suddenly.
Kearton and Ulyate had started the day together while Jones followed the dogs, and Means and Loveless had taken another route, and now, with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to him, Ulyate reined in, in the shadow of the Reef and pointed.
Kearton focussed his field glasses.
That's the Colonel, he said, but I can't see the dogs.
As they watched, Jones rode straight for the Reef.
Then they picked up the smaller black specks on the plain in front of him.
The dogs were working a trail -- lion?
Hyena?
The pack had made a bend to the north, swinging back toward the Reef, and Kearton and Ulyate could hear them faintly.
Kearton got off and tore up some dry grass that grew in cracks between the rocks and piled it in a heap and wanted to make the smoke signal that would bring Loveless and Means and the rest of the party.
Not yet, cautioned Ulyate.
Jones came toward them fast, now, along the southern toe of the Reef, and the dogs could be heard plainly, Old John with his Grand Canyon voice outstanding above the others.
There was Sounder, too, also a veteran of the North Rim, and Rastus and the Rake from a pack of English fox-hounds, and a collie from a London pound, and Simba, a terrier.
A motley pack, chosen for effectiveness, not beauty.
Jones was galloping close behind them leaning down, cheering them on.
Light it ] Ulyate said, and Kearton touched a match to the pile of grass, blew on it and flame licked out.
He threw green stuff on it, and a thin blue column of smoke rose.
That will fetch the gang and tell the Colonel where we are.
Two quick shots sounded.
Then there was a chorus of wild barking and baying.
Then the heavy roar of a lion.
Kearton and Ulyate looked at each other and began to gallop toward the sound.
It came from the top of the Reef not half a mile away.
At the base of the rocky hillside, they left their horses and climbed on foot.
The route was choked with rugged lava-rocks, creepers and bushes, so thickly overgrown that when Kearton lost sight of Ulyate and called, Ulyate answered from ten feet away.
Nice country to meet a lion in face to face.
Ulyate and Kearton climbed on toward the sound of the barking of the dogs and the sporadic roaring of the lion, till they came, out of breath, to the crest, and peering through the branches of a bush, this is what Ulyate saw : Jones who had apparently ( and actually had ) ridden up the nearly impassable hillside, sitting calmly on his horse within forty feet of a full-grown young lioness, who was crouched on a flat rock and seemed just about to charge him, while the dogs whirled around her.
Ulyate drew back with a start, and put finger to lips, almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set her off, the dogs have got her bayed.
She's just the other side of that bush ] and when they had drawn back a step he added : Jones is sitting on his horse right in front of her.
Why she doesn't charge him, I don't know.
And he hasn't even got a knife on him.
He couldn't get away from her in this kind of ground.
Careful, don't disturb her.
Jones had been about a hundred and fifty feet from her when he first broke through to the top of the Reef.
She was standing on a flat rock three feet above ground and when she saw him she rose to full height and roared, opening her mouth wide, lashing her tail, and stamping at the rock with both forefeet in irritation, as much as to say : how dare you disturb me in my sacred precinct?
Intuition told him, however, that she was tired and winded from the run up the Reef and would not charge, yet.
He moved forward to within thirty-five feet of her, being careful, because he knew the female is less predictable than the male.
( in the graveyard at Nairobi he had been shown the graves of thirty-four big game hunters killed hunting the animals he was attempting to lasso.
Of the thirty-four, seventeen had been killed by lions, and eleven out of the seventeen by lionesses.
) she snarled terribly but intuition told him, again, that she was bluffing, and he could see that half her attention was distracted by the dogs.
He threw the lasso.
It was falling over her head when a branch of a bush caught it and it fell in front of her on the rock.
Even then, if she took one step forward he could catch her.
But John nipped her rear end -- one lion's rear end was as good as another to John, Africa, Arizona no matter -- and she changed ends and took a swipe at John, but he ducked back.
Jones then recoiled his rope and threw again, this time hitting her on the back but failing to encircle her.
She whirled and faced him, roaring terribly, and Ulyate, watching through the leaves, could not understand why she did not charge and obliterate him, because he wouldn't have much of a chance of getting away, in that thick growth, but she seemed just a trace uncertain ; while Jones, on the other hand, appeared perfectly confident and Ulyate decided perhaps that was the answer.
From the lioness' point of view, this strange creature on the back of another creature, lashing out with its long thin paw, very likely appeared as something she could not at first cope with.
But now she sank lower to the rock.
Her roar changed to a growl.
Her tail no longer lashed.
Although she appeared more subdued and defeated, Jones knew she was growing more dangerous.
She was rested and could mount a charge.
Just the tip of her tail was moving as she crouched, and she was treading lightly up and down with her hind feet.
At this moment, Loveless and Means arrived, crashing through the undergrowth with their horses, and distracted her, and she ran off a short distance and jumped into a crevice between two rocks.
The dogs followed her and she killed three and badly wounded Old John.
We've got to get her out of there ] Jones yelled, or she'll kill 'em all.
Bring me the firecrackers.
For such an emergency he had included Fourth-of-*july cannon crackers as part of their equipment.
Lighting one he pitched it into the crevice, and the lioness left off mauling the dogs and departed.
Ain't she a beauty, though?
Called out Means as she ran.
Don't you go a step nearer her than I do, Jones warned, and if you do, go at a run so you'll have momentum ] for two hours they drove her from one strong point to another along the side of the Reef, trying to maneuver her onto the plain where they could get a good throw.
But she clung to the rocks and brush, and the day wore away.
It was hot.
The dogs were tired.
The men were tired too.
It was the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again.
And the sun was beginning to go down.
If dark came they would lose her.
I'll get a pole, Jones said finally, and I'll poke a noose over her head ] at this moment she was crouched in a cave-like aperture halfway down the Reef.
Ulyate made no comment but his face showed what he thought of poking ropes over lions' heads with poles, and of course these were the lions of fifty years ago, not the gentler ones of today, and this one was angry, with good reason.
Loveless, too, objected.
It won't work, Colonel.
Just the same we'll try it.
But without waiting for them to try it, she scattered the dogs and shot down the Reef and out across the plain.
John led the chase after her and the other dogs strung out behind, many of them trailing blood.
John himself was bruised and clawed from head to tail, but he was in this fight to the finish, running almost as strongly now as in the morning.
She took refuge on a tongue of land extending into a gully, crouched at the base of a thorn tree, and waited for them to come up.
She had chosen the spot well.
With the gully on three sides, she could be approached only along the tongue of land.
Careful, now, Jones warned.
Means tried her first.
Very slowly he maneuvered his rawboned bay gelding, edging closer, watching for a chance to throw, but ready to spin and run, rope whining about his head, horse edging tensely under him, but the gelding was obedient and responded and was not paralyzed by the close proximity of the lion.
They tell you horses go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion, but these didn't.
Means edged closer.
She snarled warningly.
Means spit and edged on.
Again she snarled, and again he edged.
The pony was sidewise to her.
With a whirling jump, it could get into gear.
However nothing on four legs was supposed to be faster than a lion over a short distance, unless it was a cheetah.
She charged.
Means spun and spurred.
For thirty yards she gained rapidly.
She was closing and within one more bound would have been able to reach the rear end of the bay, but -- and here Jones and Loveless and Ulyate were holding breath for all they were worth -- she never quite caught up that last bound.
Means held steady one jump ahead of her.
Then gradually he began to pull away.
A Western cowpony had outrun an African lion, from a standing start.
Photos showed later that she'd been about six feet from Means.
Of course the factor of head start made all the difference.
How much head start?
No one knew exactly.
That was the whole question.
Enough, was the answer.
The lioness quickly changed front, when she saw she couldn't catch Means, and made for Jones.
As she had done with Means, she gained rapidly at first, but then Baldy began to draw away.
Somewhere in the few scant yards of head start was the determining point.
When Jones too drew away, she returned to a thorn bush in the neck of land running into the gully, crouched low and waited as before.
This new position, however, gave the ropers a better chance.
There was room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw as you went.
So : Means edged around on the north side of her, Jones moved in from the south.
Tossing his rope and shouting he attracted her attention.
He succeeded almost too well, because once she rose as if to charge, and he half wheeled his horse -- he was within fifty feet -- but she sank back.
From behind her Means shot forward at a run.
Kearton began shouting, wait, wait -- the camera's jammed ] but Means kept on.
He raced by within twenty feet of her, roped her around the neck, but a lioness' neck is short and thick and with a quick twist she slipped the noose off.
The missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world was once left to zealous individuals and voluntary societies.
But the time came when a church that had no part in the missionary movement was looked upon as deficient in its essential life.
The Christian education of children, too, was once hardly more than a sideshow, but the day came when a congregation that did not assume full oversight of a church school was thought of as failing in its duty.
The most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today is that it is generally regarded as the responsibility of a few national leaders in each denomination and a few interdenominational executives.
Most pastors and laymen, even though they believe it to be important, assume that the ecumenical movement lies outside the province of their parishes.
They may even dismiss it from their minds as something that concerns only the ecclesiastical Rover Boys, as someone has dubbed them, who like to go to national and international assemblies, and have expense accounts that permit them to do so.
As long as this point of view prevails, the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt.
The next stage ahead is that of making it thoroughly at home in the local community.
Progress will take place far less through what is done in any summit conference of the National Council or the World Council, or even in offices of the denominational boards, than through what happens in the communities where Christian people live together as neighbors.
The front line of advance is where witnessing and worshiping congregations of different traditions exist side by side.
Until they see the ecumenical movement in terms of the difference it makes in their own attitudes, programs, and relationships, it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality.
As things now stand, there is a grievous disparity between the unity in Christ which we profess in ecumenical meetings and the complacent separateness of most congregations on any Main Street in the nation.
The ecumenical congregation the crux of ecumenical advance is an even more personalized matter than the relation between congregations in the same community.
The decisive question is what happens within each congregation and, finally, in the minds and hearts of the individual members.
It is here that the local and ecumenical must meet.
It is here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical.
It has become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be carried down to the grass roots.
This way of describing the matter is unfortunate.
It implies two misconceptions.
One is that whatever is ecumenical has to do with some over-all organization at the top and needs only to be understood at the so-called lower levels.
The truth, however, is that the ecumenical church is just the local church in its own true character as an integral unit of the whole People of God throughout the world.
The other misconception is that our ecumenical problems will be solved if only the knowledge of the church in its world-wide extension and its interdenominational connections, now comprehended by many national leaders, can be communicated to all congregations.
However needed this may be, the fundamental problem is not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of Christ in the world.
The basic unit in the church, of whatever denominational polity, is always the congregation.
It is hardly possible to emphasize this too much.
Most people do not realize that the congregation, as a gathered fellowship meeting regularly face to face, personally sharing in a common experience and expressing that experience in daily relationships with one another, is unique.
The idea that it is a feature of all religions is entirely mistaken.
The Jewish synagogue affords a parallel to the Christian congregation, but Hinduism, Buddhism, Islam, Confucianism, Taoism, Shintoism, although they have sacred scriptures, priests, spiritual disciplines, and places of prayer, do not have a congregation as a local household of faith and love.
Their characteristic experience is that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continuing social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship.
How far the fellowship in most local churches falls below what the New Testament means by koinonia ] what is now called Christian fellowship is often little more than the social chumminess of having a gracious time with the kind of people one likes.
The koinonia of Acts and of the Epistles means sharing in a common relation to Christ.
It is an experience of a new depth of community derived from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of Christ in His people.
As Dietrich Bonhoffer puts it, our community with one another consists solely in what Christ has done to both of us.
This may mean having fellowship in the church with people with whom, on the level of merely human agreeableness, we might prefer not to have any association at all.
There is a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the New Testament describes and the community of congeniality found in the average church building.
Whenever a congregation really sees itself as a unit in the universal Church, in vital relation with the whole Body of Christ and participating in His mission to the world, a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement has been laid.
The antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no longer exists.
The local and the ecumenical are one.
Of course, the perspective of those who are dealing directly with the world-wide problems of the People of God will always be different from the perspective of those who are dealing with the nearby problems of particular persons in a particular place.
Each viewpoint is valid if it is organically related to the other.
Neither is adequate if it stands alone.
Our difficulty arises when either viewpoint shuts out the other.
And this is what all too often happens.
Divergent perspectives a little parable illustrative of this truth is afforded by an incident related by Professor Bela Vasady at the end of the Second World War.
With great difficulty he made his way from his native Hungary to Geneva to renew his contacts as a member of the Provisional Committee for the World Council of Churches.
When he had the mishap of breaking his spectacles, his ecumenical colleagues insisted on providing him with new ones.
They were bifocals.
He often spoke of them as his ecumenical glasses and used them as a symbol of the kind of vision that is required in the church.
It is, he said, a bifocal vision, which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a Christian in right relation to both.
As things stand now, the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other.
On the one hand, there are ecumenists who are so stirred by the crises of the church in its encounter with the world at large that they have no eyes for what the church is doing in their own town.
They do not escape the pitfall into which Charles Dickens pictured Mrs. Jellyby as falling.
Her concern for the natives of Borrioboola-*gha was so intense that she quite forgot and neglected her son Peepy ] likewise, the ecumenist may become so absorbed in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in East Germany, the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary China, and the anguish of the church over apartheid in South Africa that he loses close contact with the parish church in its unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship, pastoral service and counseling, and Christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individuals.
On the other hand, many a pastor is so absorbed in ministering to the intimate, personal needs of individuals in his congregation that he does little or nothing to lead them into a sense of social responsibility and world mission.
As a result, they go on thinking of the church, with introverted and self-centered satisfaction, only in connection with the way in which it serves them and their families.
It would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most churches -- whether in terms of finance or spiritual concern -- is poured into the private and domestic interests of the members.
The parish lives for itself rather than for the community or the world.
The gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appears most starkly in a church in any of our comfortable suburbs.
It is eminently successful according to all conventional standards.
It is growing in numbers.
Its people are agreeable friends.
It has a beautiful edifice.
Its preaching and its music give refreshment of spirit to men and women living under heavy strain.
It provides pastoral care for the sick and troubled.
It helps children grow up with at least a nodding acquaintance with the Bible.
It draws young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation.
And it is easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this is.
But what is this church doing to help its members understand their roles as Christians in the world?
All too often its conception of parish ministry and pastoral care includes no responsibility for them in their relation to issues of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind.
It is not stirring them to confront the racial tensions of today with the mind of Christ.
It is not helping them face the moral crisis involved in the use of nuclear energy.
It is not making them sensitive to the sub-*christian level of much of our economic and industrial life.
It is raising no disturbing question as to what Christian stewardship means for the relationship of the richest nation in the world to economically underdeveloped peoples.
It is not developing an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that is called for as young churches emerge in Asia and Africa.
To put it bluntly, many a local church is giving its members only what they consciously want.
It is not disturbing them by thoughts of their Christian responsibility in relation to the world.
We shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begins to see itself not merely as a haven of comfort and peace but as a base of Christian witness and mission to the world.
There is a humorous but revealing story about a rancher who owned a large slice of Texas and who wanted to have on it everything that was necessary for a completely pleasant community.
He built a school and a library, then a recreation center and an inn.
Desiring to fill the only remaining lack, he selected the best site on the ranch for a chapel and spared no expense in erecting it.
A visitor to the beautiful little building inquired, do you belong to this church, Mr. Rancher?
Why, no, ma'am, he replied, this church belongs to me ] the story reflects the way too many people feel.
As long as the congregation regards the church as our church, or the minister thinks of it as my church, just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance.
There must first be a deeper sense that the church belongs not to us but to Christ, and that it is His purpose, not our own interests and preferences, that determines what it is to be and do.
Local embodiment of the whole a local church which conceives its function to be entirely that of ministering to the conscious desires and concerns of its members tends to look on everything ecumenical as an extra, not as a normal aspect of its own life as a church.
It would doubtless be greatly surprised to be told that in failing to be ecumenical it is really failing to be the Church of Christ.
Yet the truth, according to the New Testament, is that every local church has its existence only by being the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place.
Yet a crowd came out to see some fresh kids from the city try to match the boys from the neighboring farms ; and buggies and wagons and chugging Fords kept gathering all morning, until the edges of the field were packed thick and small boys kept scampering out on the playing field to make fun of the visitors -- whose pitcher was a formidable looking young man with the only baseball cap.
This was a bitterly fought game, carrying almost as much grudge as a fist fight, with no friendliness exhibited between the teams except the formal politeness that accompanied the setting forth of ground rules and agreements on balls that went into the crowd.
Every pitch in the game brought forth a howl from the enraptured audience and every fly ball the visitors dropped ( and because their right fielder was still a little fuzzy from drink, they dropped many ) called forth yelps of derision.
At one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who was acting as umpire got in the way of a thrown ball and took it painfully in the kidneys, he lay there unattended while players and spectators wrangled over whether the ball was dead or the base runners were free to score.
This was typical of such games, which were earnestly played to win and practically never wound up in an expression of good fellowship.
When the visitors, after losing this game, rode along the village streets toward home, the youngsters who could keep abreast of them for a moment or two screamed triumphantly, you bunch of hay-shakers ] g'ahn back home ] you hay-shakers ] baseball was surely the national game in those days, even though professional baseball may have been merely a business.
Radio broadcasts had not begun and most devotees of baseball attended the games near home, in the town park or a pasture, with perhaps two or three trips to the city each season to see the Cubs or the Pirates or the Indians or the Red Sox.
Young men in school could look forward to playing ball for money in a dozen different places, even if they failed to make the major leagues.
Nearly any lad with a modicum of skill might find a payday awaiting him in the Three *j League, or the Pony League, or the Coastal Plains League, or the fast Eastern League, if not indeed in one of the hundreds of city leagues that abounded everywhere.
Even a city of thirty thousand might have six baseball teams, sponsored by grocers and hardware merchants or department stores, that played two or three times a week throughout the summer, usually in the cool of the evening, before an earnest and partisan audience who did not begrudge a quarter each, or even more, to be dropped into a hat when the game was half over.
Babe Ruth, of course, was everyone's hero, and everyone knew him, even though relatively few ever saw him play ball.
His face was always in the newspapers, sometimes in cartoons that seemed nearly as large as life.
As the twenties grew older, and as radio broadcasts of baseball games began to involve more and more people daily in the doings of the professionals, the great hitters ( always led by Babe Ruth ) overshadowed the game so that pitchers were nearly of no account.
Boys no longer bothered learning to bunt and even school kids scorned to choke up on a bat as Willie Keeler and the famous hitters of another day had done.
Other hitters bloomed with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dared to dream of matching Ruth, who was still called Jidge by all his friends, or Leo or Two-*head by those who dared to taunt him ( Leo was the name of the ball player he liked the least ) and who called most of the world Kid.
Lou Gehrig was given the nickname Buster, and he ran Ruth a close race in home runs.
But the nickname never stuck and Gehrig was no match for Ruth in color -- which is sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field.
Ruth was a delinquent boy still, but he was in every way a great ball player who was out to win the game and occasionally risked a cracked bone to do it.
A few professional baseball players cultivated eccentricities, with the encouragement of the press, so that they might see their names in big black print, along with Daddy Browning's, Al Capone's, Earl Sande's, and the Prince of Wales'.
One who, for a time, succeeded best and was still the sorriest of all was Charles Arthur Shires, who called himself, in the newspapers, Art the Great, or The Great Shires.
It was his brag that he could beat everybody at anything, but especially at fighting, and he once took on the manager of his club and worked him over thoroughly with his fists.
He was given to public carousing and to acting the clown on the diamond ; and a policeman asserted he had found a pair of brass knuckles in Art's pocket once when he had occasion to collar the Great First Baseman for some forgotten reason.
( this made a sportswriter named Pegler wonder in print if Art had worn this armament when he defeated his manager.
) the sorry fact about this young man, who was barely of age when he broke into major-league baseball, was that he really was a better ball player than he was given credit for being -- never so good as he claimed, and always an irritant to his associates, but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on his skills or cut up in public.
In his minor way Charles Arthur Shires was perhaps more typical of his era than Ruth was, for he was but one of many young men who laid waste their talents in these Scott Fitzgerald days for the sake of earning space in the newspapers.
There were others who climbed flagpoles and refused to come down ; or who ingested strange objects, like live fish ; or who undertook to set records for remaining erect on a dance floor, with or without a partner ; or who essayed to down full bottles of illicit gin without pausing for breath.
One young man, exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment, performed a perfect swan dive out of the stands at the Yale Bowl during the Yale-*army football game, landed squarely on his head on the concrete ramp below, and died at once.
But the twenties were not all insanity and a striving after recognition.
The business of baseball began to prosper along with other entertainments, and performers -- thanks partly to George Herman Ruth's spectacular efforts each season to run his salary higher and higher -- prospered too.
While fifty years before, Albert Goodwill Spalding, secretary of the Chicago Ball Club of the National League, could write earnestly to the manager of the Buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollars for a baseball game in August, in this Golden Era a game at the Yankee Stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollars at the gate.
And while less than ten years earlier the wayward Black Sox -- all of them top performers in their positions -- had toiled for stingy Charles Comiskey at salaries ranging from twenty-five hundred dollars to forty-five hundred dollars a year, stars now were asking ten thousand dollars, twenty thousand dollars, yes, even fifty thousand dollars a season.
The greatest team of this period was unquestionably the New York Yankees, bought by brewery millions and made into a ball club by men named Ed Barrow and Miller Huggins.
Boston fans sometimes liked to wring some wry satisfaction out of the fact that most of the great 1923-27 crew were graduates of the Red Sox -- sold to millionaires Huston and Ruppert by a man who could not deny them their most trifling desire.
Ruth himself, still owning his farm in Massachusetts and an interest in the Massachusetts cigar business that printed his round boyish face on the wrappers, had led the parade down from Fenway Park, followed by pitchers Carl Mays, Leslie Joe Bush, Waite Hoyt, Herb Pennock, and Sam Jones, catcher Wally Schang, third baseman Joe Dugan ( who completed the playboy trio of Ruth, Dugan, and Hoyt ), and shortstop Everett Scott.
By 1926, when the mighty Yanks were at their mightiest, only a few of these were left but they still shone brightest, even beside able and agile rookies like Tony Lazzeri ( who managed never to have one of his epileptic fits on the field ), Mark Koenig, Lou Gehrig, George Pipgras, and gray-thatched Earl Combs.
The deeds of this team, through two seasons and in the two World's Series that followed, have been written and talked about until hardly a word is left to be said.
But there is one small episode that a few New York fans who happened to sit in the cheap seats for one World's Series game in 1926 like best to recall.
Babe Ruth, as he always did in the Stadium, played right field to avoid having the sun in his eyes, and Tommy Thevenow, a rather mediocre hitter who played shortstop for the St. Louis Cardinals, knocked a ball with all his might into the sharp angle formed by the permanent stands and the wooden bleachers, where Ruth could not reach it.
The ball lay there, shining white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while Ruth, red-necked with frustration, charged about the small patch of ground screaming, where's the -- -ing ball?
But, as he snarled unhappily when the inning was over, not a sonofabitch in the place would tell me, so little Tommy ran all the way home.
The ordinary man and woman, however, saw little of the great professional games of those Golden Days, or of any other sporting event for that matter.
Promoters always hastened to place their choice tickets in the hands of the wealthy speculators, and only the man who knew the man who knew the fellow who had an in with the guy at the box office ever came up with a good seat for a contest of any importance.
Radio broadcasts, however -- now that even plain people could afford loud speakers on their sets -- held old fans to the major-league races and attracted new ones, chiefly women, who through what the philosopher called the ineluctable modality of audition, became first inured, then attracted, then addicted to the long afternoon recitals of the doings in some distant baseball park.
In some cities games were broadcast throughout the week and then on weekends the announcer was silenced, and fans must needs drive to the city from all the broadcast area to discover how their heroes were faring.
This had a pleasant effect upon the Sunday gate receipts as well as upon the intake of the rail and bus companies, some of which began to offer special excursion rates, including seats at the park, just as the trolley and ferry companies had when baseball was new.
While women had always attended ball games in small numbers ( it was the part of a dead game sport in the early years of the twentieth century to be taken out to the ball park and to root, root, root for the home team ), they had often sat in patient martyrdom, unable even to read the scoreboard, which sometimes seemed to indicate that one team led another by a score of three hundred and eighty to one hundred and fifty-one.
The questions women asked at baseball games were standard grist for amateur comedy, as were the doings of women automobile drivers ; for every grown man ( except a few who were always suspected of being shy on virility ) knew at least the fundamentals of baseball, just as every male American in this era liked to imagine ( or pretend ) that he could fight with his fists.
And women were not expected to know that the pitcher was trying not to let the batter hit the ball.
Radio, however, so increased the interest of women in the game that it was hardly necessary even to have Ladies' Days any longer to enable men to get to the ball park without interference at home.
Women actually began to appear unaccompanied in the stands, where they still occasionally ran the risk of coming home with a tobacco-juice stain on a clean skirt or a new curse word tingling their ears.
The radio broadcasts themselves were often so patiently informative, despite the baseball jargon, that girls and women could begin to store up in their minds the same sort of random and meaningless statistics that small boys had long learned better than they ever did their lessons in school.
This conclusion is dependent on the assumption that traditional sex mores will continue to sanction both premarital chastity as the ideal, and the double standard holding females primarily responsible for preserving the ideal.
Our discussion of this involves using Erik Erikson's schema of identity vs. identity diffusion as a conceptual tool in superimposing a few common denominators onto the diverse personality and family configurations of the unwed mothers from whose case histories we quoted earlier.
Our discussion does not utilize all the identity crises postulated by Erikson, but is intended to demonstrate the utility of his theoretical schema for studying unwed mothers.
We hope thereby to emphasize that, from a psychological standpoint, the effectual prevention of illegitimacy is a continuous long-term process involving the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence.
Hypothesizing a series of developmental stages that begin in the individual's infancy and end in his old age, Erikson has indicated that the adolescent is faced with a series of identity crises.
The successful and positive resolution of these crises during adolescence involves an epigenetic principle -- during adolescence, the individual's positive resolutions in each area of identity crisis depend, to a considerable degree, on his already having resolved preliminary and preparatory identity crises during his infancy, childhood, and early adolescence.
Within Erikson's schema, the adolescent's delinquent behavior -- in this case, her unwed motherhood -- reflects her identity diffusion, or her inability to resolve these various identity crises positively.
The adolescent experiences identity crises in terms of time perspective vs. time diffusion.
Time perspective -- the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratifying immediate wants in order to achieve long-range objectives -- is more easily developed if, from infancy on, the individual has been able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she lives.
Erikson has noted that, unless this trust developed early, the time ambivalence experienced, in varying degree and temporarily, by all adolescents ( as a result of their remembering the more immediate gratification of wants during childhood, while not yet having fully accepted the long-range planning required by adulthood ) may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion.
Experience of this time diffusion ranges from a sense of utter apathy to a feeling of desperate urgency to act immediately.
These polar extremes in time diffusion were indicated in some of the comments by unwed mothers reported in earlier chapters.
Some of these mothers, apparently feeling a desperate urgency, made, on the spur of the moment, commitments, in love and sex, that would have life-long consequences.
Others displayed utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future.
For many of these unwed mothers, the data on their family life and early childhood experiences revealed several indications and sources of their basic mistrust of their parents in particular and of the world in general.
However, as Erickson has noted, the individual's failure to develop preliminary identities during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a given area of identity diffusion in his ( or her ) adolescence.
And, as shown in Chapter 6, some *j females originally developed such trust only during their adolescence, through the aid of, and their identification with, alter-parents.
In the specific case of time diffusion, we must emphasize the significance of the earlier development of mistrust when it is combined with the inevitable time crisis experienced by most ( if not all ) adolescents in our society, and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunities for developing trust.
The adolescent experiences two closely related crises : self-certainty vs. an identity consciousness ; and role-experimentation vs. negative identity.
A sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different roles, or confidence in one's own unique behavior as an alternative to peer-group conformity, is more easily developed during adolescence if, during early childhood, the individual was permitted to exercise initiative and encouraged to develop some autonomy.
However, if the child has been constantly surrounded, during nursery and early school age, by peer groups ; inculcated with the primacy of group acceptance and group standards ; and allowed little initiative in early play and work patterns -- then in adolescence her normal degree of vanity, sensitivity, and preoccupation with whether others find her appearance and behavior acceptable, will be compounded.
Her ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestions and criticisms by anyone except peer friends during adolescence are the manifestations, in her adolescence, of her having been indoctrinated in childhood to feel shame, if not guilt, for failing to behave in a manner acceptable to, and judged by, the performance of her nursery- and elementary-school peer friends.
To be different is to invite shame and doubt ; and it is better to be shamed and criticized by one's parents, who already consider one different and difficult to understand, than by one's peers, who are also experiencing a similar groping for and denial of adult status.
The attitudes of some unwed mothers quoted in Chapter 2, revealed both considerable preoccupation with being accepted by others and a marked absence of self-certainty.
Many appeared to regard their sexual behavior as a justifiable means of gaining acceptance from and identification with others ; but very few seemed aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplemented with more enduring and stable identification of and with one's self.
Another identity crisis confronting the adolescent involves anticipation of achievement vs. work-paralysis.
The adolescent's capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete tasks successfully depends on the degree to which he or she developed autonomy, initiative, and self-discipline during childhood.
The developmental process involves the individual's progressively experiencing a sense of dignity and achievement resulting from having completed tasks, having kept commitments, and having created something ( however small or simple -- even a doll dress of one's own design rather than in the design it ought to be ).
These childhood experiences are sources of the self-certainty that the adolescent needs, for experimenting with many roles, and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of exploring and discovering her skills and abilities.
If she has not had such experiences, the female's normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compounded.
She may well be incapacitated by it when she is confronted with present and future alternatives -- e.g., whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker ; whether to stay financially dependent on her parents or help support herself while attending school ; whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school ; and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study.
Erikson has noted that, as this indecision mounts, it may result in a paralysis of workmanship.
This paralysis may be expressed in the female's starting -- and never completing -- many jobs, tasks, and courses of study ; and in the fact that she bases her decisions about work, college, carreer, and studies on what others are doing, rather than on her own sense of identity with given skills, abilities, likes, and dislikes.
The absence, during her childhood and early adolescence, of experiences in developing the self-discipline to complete tasks within her ability -- experiences that would have been subsequent sources of anticipation of achievement -- and her lack of childhood opportunities to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression, both tend in her adolescence to deprive her of the freedoms to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experimenting.
The comments made by some unwed mothers ( quoted in Chapter 2 ) reflect this paralysis of workmanship.
They attended school and selected courses primarily on the basis of decisions others made ; they accepted a job primarily because it was available, convenient, and paid reasonably.
These things both express and, at the same time, continue contributing to, their identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of developing dignity and self-certainty.
As their identity diffusion increased, they became more susceptible to sporadic diversions in love and sexual affairs.
These affairs temporarily relieved the monotony of school or work activities containing no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship, no sense of dignity derived from a job well done.
Childhood experiences in learning work and self-discipline habits within a context of developing autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy.
The excerpts from case histories presented above confirm this significance, though through different facets of experience.
For example, some unwed mothers had had no work experiences, household chores, and responsibilities during childhood and early adolescence ; they subsequently occupied their leisure hours in searching for something exciting and diverting.
Sex was both.
On the other hand, some unwed mothers had had so much work and responsibility imposed on them at an early age, and had thus had so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative, that their work and responsibilities became dull and unrewarding burdens -- to be escaped and rebelled against through fun and experimentation with forbidden sexual behavior.
The adolescent also faces the identity crisis that Erikson has termed ideological polarization vs. diffusion of ideals.
In discussing the ways this crisis is germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy, we shall again superimpose Erikson's concept on our data.
Adolescents have a much-discussed tendency to polarize ideas and values, to perceive things as either-or, black or white -- nuances of meaning are relatively unimportant.
This tendency is, perhaps, most clearly revealed in the literature on religious conversions and experiences of adolescents.
Erikson has postulated that such ideological polarization temporarily resolves their search for something stable and definite in the rapidly changing and fluctuating no-man's-land between childhood and adulthood.
It provides identification -- with an idea, a value, a cause that cuts through, or even transcends, the multiple and ambivalent identities of their passage from child to adult, and permits their forceful and overt expression of emotion.
The positive development, during adolescence, of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increasing independence, and to identify overtly either with or against given ideas, values, and practices, depends to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunities for developing autonomy, initiative, and self-certainty.
Most adolescents have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stages, as they experience a proliferation of ideas and values.
The diffusion is most pronounced and most likely to become fixed, however, in those who have had no or very minimal opportunities to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have been directed into constructive expression and so served as sources of developing self-certainty.
A pronounced ideological diffusion -- i.e., inability to identify independently given ideas and value systems -- is reflected in many ways.
For example, it is evinced by the adolescent ( or adult ) whose beliefs and actions represent primarily his rebellion and reaction against the ideas and behavior patterns of others, rather than his inner conviction and choice.
It is mirrored by the individual Willie Lohmans, whose ideas and behavior patterns are so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment.
In another sense, it is represented in the arguments of the true believers who seek to disprove the validity of all other beliefs and ideas in order to retain confidence in theirs.
The case histories provide some interesting illustrations of ideological diffusion, embodied in the unwed mother's inability to identify independently a given value system or behavior pattern, and her subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for her sexual behavior.
For example, the unwed mothers expressed their frustration with males who did not indicate more explicitly what it is they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly.
They were disappointed by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse.
They condemned the movie script writers for implying that sex was enjoyable and exhilarating.
They criticized parents for never having emphasized traditional concepts of right and wrong ; and they censured parents who never disciplined and were too permissive or who never explained how easy it was to get pregnant.
In the adult world, there are a number of rather general and diffuse sources of ideological diffusion that further compound the adolescent's search for meaning during this particular identity crisis.
For example, some contemporary writing tends to fuse the good guys and the bad guys, to portray the weak people as heroes and weakness as a virtue, and to explain ( or even justify ) asocial behavior by attributing it to deterministic psychological, familial, and social experiences.
In the final accounting, these would have augmented the bill for both sides.
An estimate of one million dollars is probably not excessive.
Yet the huge amount of money consumed by the Selden litigation, which many regarded as wasteful, indirectly contributed to constructive changes in legal procedure.
The duration and other circumstances of the Selden case made it a flagrant example of the gross abuses of patent infringement actions.
The suit, as we have seen, came before the courts when patent attorneys, inventors, and laymen were making mounting demands for reforms in the American patent system.
Chief among the defects they singled out were the complicated and wearisome procedures in equity.
In a long and angry footnote to his opinion, Judge Hough had lent the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism.
It is a duty, said Hough, not to let pass this opportunity of protesting against the methods of taking and printing testimony in Equity, current in this circuit ( and probably others ), excused if not justified by the rules of the Supreme Court, especially to be found in patent causes, and flagrantly exemplified in this litigation.
As long as the bar prefers to adduce evidence by written deposition, rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer, I fear that the antiquated rules will remain unchanged, and expensive prolixity remain the best known characteristic of Equity.
Observing that reforms sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible examples, Hough catalogued the many abuses encouraged by existing procedures.
He cited the elephantine dimensions of the Selden case record ; the duplication of testimony and exhibits ; the numerous squabbles over minor matters ; the objections stated at outrageous length ; and the frequent and rancorous verbal bouts, uncalled for and unjustifiable, from the retort discourteous to the lie direct.
The fundamental difficulty of which the Selden case was a striking ( though not singular ) example, concluded Hough, will remain as long as testimony is taken without any authoritative judicial officer present, and responsible for the maintenance of discipline, and the reception or exclusion of testimony.
Not least among the members of the patent bar who echoed this powerful indictment were those who had participated in the Selden suit.
William A. Redding asserted that if the case had been heard in open court under rules of evidence, the testimony would have been completed in sixty days instead of five years.
Inventors joined lawyers in the clamor for reform, inevitably centering upon the Selden litigation as a horrible example.
Its costive deliberations were likened to those of the British courts of chancery mercilessly caricatured by Dickens in Bleak House.
Parker, who agreed with much of this criticism, did not conceal his dissatisfaction with procedural defects.
But he felt that the Selden case was being unfairly pilloried.
In a detailed letter published in the Scientific American in 1912, he remarked that loose statements about the case showed scant understanding of the facts.
The suit, although commonly designated as a single action, actually embraced five cases.
Parker insisted that the size of the record would have been drastically reduced but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony.
In a private communication written in 1911, Parker had been more to the point.
Noting the complaints of inventors and members of the patent bar, he admitted that some of the strictures were fairly well founded, but he added that under existing rules the courts could not consolidate testimony in a group of suits involving separate infringements of the same patent.
The vast industrial interests caught up in the Selden suit, as well as the complex character of the automotive art, encouraged both sides to exploit every possible chance for or against the patent, said Parker.
This very seldom happens in this class or in other cases, and of course all of these matters led to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur.
Parker listed the remedies he deemed essential for reducing the cost and mass of testimony.
The most important of these found him in agreement with Hough's plea for reform.
Parker called for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of taking depositions before officers of the court who had no authority to limit testimony.
The taking of depositions, he suggested, should be placed under a special court examiner empowered to compel responsive and relevant answers and to exclude immaterial testimony.
I am satisfied that in the Selden case had this power existed and this course ( been ) pursued, it would have shortened the depositions of some of the experts nearly one-half and of some of the other witnesses thereto more than that.
In the end Hough's acidulous protest, which Parker called the now somewhat famous note on this Selden case, did not go unheeded.
In 1912 the United States Supreme Court adopted a new set of rules of equity which became effective on February 1, 1913.
The revised procedure was acclaimed as a long-overdue reform.
Under the new rules, testimony is taken orally in open court in all cases except those of an extraordinary character.
Other expeditious methods are designed to prevent prolixity, limit delays, and reduce the expense of infringement suits.
One of the A.*l.*a.*m. lawyers observed that if the Selden case had been tried under this simplified procedure, the testimony which filled more than a score of volumes, at a minimum cost of $1 a page for publication alone, could have been contained in one volume.
While patent suits are still among the most complex and expensive forms of litigation, these rules have saved litigants uncounted sums of money.
There is little doubt that they were promulgated by the Supreme Court as a direct result of the Selden patent suit.

Even before it was formally dissolved in 1912, the A.*l.*a.*m. was succeeded by the Automobile Board of Trade, the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day Automobile Manufacturers Association.
The trade bodies which came in the wake of the A.*l.*a.*m. were more representative, for they never adopted a policy of exclusion.
Nevertheless, it is from the Selden organization that the industry inherited its institutional machinery for furthering the broader interests of the trade.
One of the chief features of this community of interest is the automotive patents cross-licensing agreement, a milestone in the development of American industrial cooperation.
Its origin lies in the Selden patent controversy and its aftermath.
From the earliest days of the motor car industry, before the A.*l.*a.*m. was established, patent infringement loomed as a serious and vexing problem.
Many patent contests were waged over automobile components and accessories, among them tires, detachable rims, ball bearings, license brackets, and electric horns.
The fluidity and momentum of the young industry abetted a general disregard of patent claims.
As early as 1900 a Wall Street combination acquired detail patents with the intention of exacting heavy tribute from automobile manufacturers.
This scheme failed, and the following decade brought a deluge of infringement suits among individual manufacturers that reached its crest in 1912.
In this tangle of conflicting claims, the patent-sharing scheme adopted by the A.*l.*a.*m. at its founding proved to be the best device for avoiding or mitigating the burdens of incessant litigation.
The interchange of shop licenses for a nominal royalty eliminated infringement suits among the members of the A.*l.*a.*m. patent pool ( although it did not protect them against outside actions ) and kept open channels for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology.
One of the conditions of the pool was a prohibition upon the withholding of patent rights among A.*l.*a.*m. members.
Within its limits, this arrangement had the actual or potential characteristics of a cross-licensing agreement.
Its positive features outweighed the fact that the pool was an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly.
Since the A.*l.*a.*m. holdings embraced only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patents, the denial of rights to independent companies did not retard technical progress in unlicensed sectors of the industry.
The highly important Dyer patents on the sliding gear transmission were held by the A.*l.*a.*m. pool.
But Henry Ford used the planetary transmission in his Model *j and earlier cars and, in 1905, as a precautionary measure, took out a license from the man who claimed to be its inventor.
For those affiliated with it, the A.*l.*a.*m. pool was a haven from the infringement actions involving detail patents that beset the industry with mounting intensity after 1900.
By 1910 the courts were crowded with cases, many of them brought by freebooters who trafficked in disputed inventions.
It was commonplace for auto makers, parts-suppliers, and dealers to find warning notices and threats of infringement suits in their daily mail.
Purely from the business man's standpoint and without regard to the lawyer's view, commented a trade journal, the matter of patents in the automobile and accessory trade is developing some phases and results that challenge thought as to how far patents are to become weapons of warfare in business, instead of simple beneficient protection devices for encouraging inventive creation.
Occasionally new enterprise was discouraged by the almost certain prospect of legal complications.
One manufacturer who held an allegedly basic patent said : I would readily put over $50,000 into the manufacture of the device, but it is so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolonged ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all our profits.
The prevailing view in the industry was summed up in 1912 by a group of auto makers who told a Senate committee : the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive conditions, including delays surrounding legal disputes, particularly in patent litigation, are items of industrial burden which must be written large in figures of many millions of dollars of industrial waste.
By that time it was commonly agreed that patent warfare was sapping constructive achievement and blocking the free exchange of technical information.
At this point Charles C. Hanch, long an advocate of patent peace in the industry, became chairman of the patents committee of the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, successor to the Automobile Board of Trade.
Hanch was treasurer of the Nordyke & Marmon Company, an Indianapolis firm which had manufactured flour-milling machinery before producing the Marmon car in 1904.
He had first-hand knowledge of the patent wars which had driven about ninety per cent of the milling equipment makers out of business in the mid-1890's.
Anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry, Hanch went to Detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of leading A.*l.*a.*m. members for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan.
The breach created by the Selden patent doomed his proposal, but Hanch did not abandon his scheme.
After the demise of the A.*l.*a.*m., the time was propitious for establishing such a pool.
Most manufacturers were now disposed to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patents.
It is a much easier course to agree to let one another alone so far as ordinary patents are concerned, said a trade authority, than to continue the costly effort of straightening the tangle in the courts or seeking to reform the patent system, which appears to be getting into deeper confusion every day.
With the other members of the patents committee -- Wilfred C. Leland, Howard E. Coffin, Windsor T. White, and W. H. Vandervoort -- Hanch drafted a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free licensing was his own contribution.
The plan was supported by Frederick P. Fish, counsel for the National Automobile Chamber of Commerce.
It will be recalled that in his summation for the A.*l.*a.*m. before Judge Hough, Fish had condemned patent litigation as the curse of the American industrial community.
He was well aware that some inventors and their allies used their patents solely for nuisance value.
My personal view is that not one patented invention in ten is worth making, he later told a Congressional committee.
The eloquent persuasions of Fish guaranteed the adoption of the plan by the members of the automotive trade association.
Drawn up in 1914, the cross-licensing agreement became effective in 1915.
It remained in force for ten years and has been renewed at five-year intervals since 1925.
A little farther along the road you come to the Church of Santa Sabina, called the Pearl of the Aventine.
Continue another hundred yards to the Piazza of the Knights of Malta.
On the wall of this square there are delightful bas-reliefs of musical instruments.
The massive gate of the Maltese villa affords one of the most extraordinary views in Rome.
If you look through the keyhole, you will see an artistically landscaped garden with the white dome of St. Peter's framed in a long avenue of cropped laurel trees.
Retrace your steps a few yards on the Via Di Santa Sabina and turn right on the Via Di S. Alessio, a street lined with stately homes.
Oleanders, cypress, and palms in the spacious gardens add much color and beauty to this attractive residential section.
Turn left a block or so before the street ends, and then turn right down the Via Di Santa Prisca to the Viale Aventino.
Here you can pick up a taxi or public transport to return to the center of the city.
The renaissance city to the piazza Navona and pantheon these two walks take you through the heart of Rome.
You will walk some of the narrow, old streets, hemmed in by massive palazzi.
You will visit a few churches that are exceptional yet often by-passed, a magnificent square, the main shopping district, the Spanish Steps, and the lovely Pincian Gardens.
By seeing such varied places, both interesting and beautiful, you will become aware of the many different civilizations Rome has lived through, and in particular, get a feel of Renaissance Rome.
You will realize why Rome is indeed the Eternal City.
Start on the Via D. Teatro Di Marcello at the foot of the Capitoline Hill.
The majestic circular tiers of stone of the Theatre of Marcellus give you some idea of the huge edifice that the Emperor Augustus erected in 13 B.*c..
Twenty-two thousand spectators used to crowd it in Roman days.
Andrea Palladio, an Italian architect of the sixteenth century, modeled his designs on its Doric and Ionic columns.
Wander past the three superb Columns of Apollo by the arches of the theatre.
The remains of the Portico of Octavia are now in front of you.
Climb the steps from the theatre to the Via Della Tribuna Di Campitelli for an even better view of the Columns of Apollo.
Turn to the right along a narrow street to the tiny Piazza Campitelli, then proceed along the Via Dei Funari to the Piazza Mattei.
Here is one of the loveliest fountains in Rome, the Fontana delle Tartarughe or Fountain of the Tortoises.
It's typical of Rome that in the midst of this rather poor area you should find such an artistic work in the center of a little square.
Stand here for a few moments and look at this gem of a fountain with its four youths, each holding a tortoise and each with a foot resting on the head of a dolphin.
The figures have been executed so skillfully that one senses a great feeling of life and movement.
Opposite is the Palazzo Mattei, one of Rome's oldest palaces, now the headquarters of the Italo-*american Association.
Go inside for a closer look at a Renaissance palace.
In the first courtyard there are some fine bas-reliefs and friezes, and in the second a series of delightful terraced roof gardens above an ivy-covered wall.
The Palazzo Caetani, still inhabited by the Caetani family, adjoins the Palazzo Mattei.
Keep straight ahead on the Via Falegnami, cross the wide Via Arenula, and you will come to the Piazza B. Cairoli, where you should look in at the Church of San Carlo Ai Catinari to see the frescoes on the ceiling.
Follow the colorful and busy Via D. Giubbonari for a hundred yards or so.
Now turn left at the Via dell' Arco Del Monte to the Piazza Dei Pellegrini.
Just a few yards to the right on the Via Capo Di Ferro will bring you to the Palazzo Spada, built in 1540 and now occupied by the Council of State.
Paintings by Titian, Caravaggio, and Rubens are on display ( open 9:30 to 4:00 ).
Before you enter the palazzo, note Francesco Borromini's facade.
The great architect also designed the fine interior staircase and colonnade which connects the two courts.
The large statue on the first floor is believed to be the statue of Pompey at the base of which Julius Caesar was stabbed to death ( if so, the statue once stood in the senate house ).
( this is shown in the afternoon and on Sunday morning.
) by tipping the porter, you can see in the courtyard Borromini's unusual and fascinating trick in perspective.
When you stand before the barrel-vaulted colonnade you have the impression that the statue at the end is at a considerable distance, yet it is actually only a few feet away.
The sense of perspective has been created by designing the length of the columns so that those at the far end of the colonnade are much shorter than those in front.
The gardens of the palazzo, shaded by a huge magnolia tree, are most attractive.
The courtyard is magnificently decorated.
From the Palazzo Spada you continue another block along the Via Capo Di Ferro and Vicolo De Venti to the imposing Palazzo Farnese, begun in 1514 and considered by many to be the finest palace of all.
Michelangelo was the most distinguished of several noted architects who helped design it.
Today it is occupied by the French Embassy.
Its lovely seventeenth-century ceiling frescoes, as well as the huge guards room with a tremendously high and beautifully carved wooden ceiling, can be seen Sundays ( 11:00 to 12:00 noon ).
Ask to see the modern tapestries of Paris and Rome designed by Lurcat.
Directly in front of the palace along the Via D. Baullari you will come to the Campo Di Fiori, the famous site of executions during the turbulent days of Renaissance Rome.
Today, by contrast it is a lively and colorful fruit, vegetable, and flower market.
Continue on the Via D. Baullari to the Corso Vittorio Emanuele, then turn right for a couple of hundred yards to the Church of Sant' Andrea Della Valle.
As you approach the church on the Via D. Baullari you are passing within yards of the remains of the Roman Theatre of Pompey, near which is believed to have been the place where Julius Caesar was assassinated.
The dome of the church is, outside of St. Peter's, one of the largest in Rome.
Opera lovers will be interested to learn that this church was the scene for the first act of Tosca.
At this point you cross the wide Corso Vittorio Emanuele 2, walk along the Corso Del Rinascimento a couple of hundred yards, then turn left on the Via Dei Canestrani to enter the splendid Piazza Navona, one of the truly glorious sights in Rome.
Your first impression of this elongated square with its three elegant fountains, its two churches that almost face each other, and its russet-colored buildings, is a sense of restful spaciousness -- particularly welcome after wandering around the narrow and dark streets that you have followed since starting this walk.
The site of the oblong piazza is Domitian's ancient stadium, which was probably used for horse and chariot races.
For centuries it was the location of historic festivals and open-air sports events.
From the seventeenth to the nineteenth century it was a popular practice to flood the piazza in the summer, and the aristocrats would then ride around the inundated square in their carriages.
Giovanni Bernini's Fountain of the Rivers, in the center of the piazza, is built around a Roman obelisk from the Circus of Maxentius which rests on grottoes and rocks, with four huge figures, one at each corner, denoting four great rivers from different continents -- the Danube, the Ganges, the Nile, and the Plate.
The eyes of the figure of the Nile are covered, perhaps either to symbolize the mystery of her source or to obscure from her sight the baroque facade of the Church of Sant' Agnese in Agone, the work of Bernini's rival, Borromini.
In the Piazza Navona there are many delightful cafes where you can sit, have a drink or lunch, and watch the fountains in the square.
The scene before you is indeed theatrical and often appears in movies about Rome.
Perhaps a street musician will pass to add that extra touch.
Take the Via Di S. Agnese in Agone, next to the church and opposite the center of the square, then turn right after about two hundred yards to reach the beautiful Church of Santa Maria Della Pace.
Inside you will find the lovely Sibyls painted by Raphael and a chapel designed by Michelangelo.
The church's cloisters are among Donato Bramante's most beautiful creations.
Now return to the Piazza Navona and leave it on the opposite side by the Corsia Agonale ; in a moment cross the Corso Del Rinascimento.
In front of you is the Palazzo Madama, once belonging to the Medici and now the Italian Senate.
Walk by the side of the palazzo and after two blocks along the Via Giustiniani you will come to the Piazza Della Rotonda.
You are now facing the Pantheon, the largest and best-preserved building still standing from the days of ancient Rome.
This circular edifice, constructed by Agrippa in B.*c. 27, was rebuilt in its present shape by the Emperor Hadrian.
It was dedicated as a church in the seventh century.
As you pause in the piazza by the Egyptian obelisk brought from the Temple of Isis, you will admire the Pantheon's impressive Corinthian columns.
The Pantheon's interior, still in its original form, is truly majestic and an architectural triumph.
Its rotunda forms a perfect circle whose diameter is equal to the height from the floor to the ceiling.
The only means of interior light is the twenty-nine-foot-wide aperture in the stupendous dome.
Standing before the tomb of Raphael, the great genius of the Renaissance, when shafts of sunlight are penetrating this great Roman temple, you are once again reminded of the varied civilizations so characteristic of Rome.
As you leave the Pantheon, take the narrow street to the right, the Via Del Seminario, a block to Sant' Ignazio, one of the most splendid baroque churches in the city.
( along the way there, about one hundred yards on your right, you pass a simple restaurant, La Sacrestia, where you can have the best pizza in Rome.
) the curve of faded terra-cotta-colored houses in front of the church seems like a stage set.
This is one of the most charming little squares in this part of Rome.
One block along the Via De Burro ( in front of the church ) will bring you to the Stock Exchange in the old Temple of Neptune.
A few yards farther, on the Via Dei Bergamaschi, is the Piazza Colonna.
The great column from which the square takes its name was erected by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius.
You are now at the Corso, though narrow, one of Rome's busiest streets.
Horse races took place here in the Middle Ages.
If you have taken this stroll in the morning, and you have the time and inclination, walk to the right along the crowded Corso for half a dozen blocks to visit the fine private collection of paintings -- mainly of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -- in the Palazzo Doria ( open Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday, 10:00 to 1:00 ).
Here is your opportunity to see the inside of a palazzo where the family still lives.
Otherwise, cross over the Corso and walk a block or so to the left.
You will come to Alemagna, a delightful, though moderately expensive restaurant, which is particularly noted for its exceptional selection of ice creams and patisseries.
Either here, or in one of the modest restaurants nearby, is just the place to end this first walk through the heart of Rome.
To the Spanish steps the second walk through the heart of Rome should be taken after lunch, so that you will reach the Pincian Hill when the soft light of the late afternoon is at its best.
Rare, indeed, is the Harlem citizen, from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent, who does not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence, injustice, or brutality.
I myself have witnessed and endured it more than once.
The businessmen and racketeers also have a story.
And so do the prostitutes.
( and this is not, perhaps, the place to discuss Harlem's very complex attitude toward black policemen, nor the reasons, according to Harlem, that they are nearly all downtown.
) it is hard, on the other hand, to blame the policeman, blank, good-natured, thoughtless, and insuperably innocent, for being such a perfect representative of the people he serves.
He, too, believes in good intentions and is astounded and offended when they are not taken for the deed.
He has never, himself, done anything for which to be hated -- which of us has?
-- and yet he is facing, daily and nightly, people who would gladly see him dead, and he knows it.
There is no way for him not to know it : there are few things under heaven more unnerving than the silent, accumulating contempt and hatred of a people.
He moves through Harlem, therefore, like an occupying soldier in a bitterly hostile country ; which is precisely what, and where, he is, and is the reason he walks in twos and threes.
And he is not the only one who knows why he is always in company : the people who are watching him know why, too.
Any street meeting, sacred or secular, which he and his colleagues uneasily cover has as its explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination.
And these days, of course, in terms increasingly vivid and jubilant, it speaks of the end of that domination.
The white policeman standing on a Harlem street corner finds himself at the very center of the revolution now occurring in the world.
He is not prepared for it -- naturally, nobody is -- and, what is possibly much more to the point, he is exposed, as few white people are, to the anguish of the black people around him.
Even if he is gifted with the merest mustard grain of imagination, something must seep in.
He cannot avoid observing that some of the children, in spite of their color, remind him of children he has known and loved, perhaps even of his own children.
He knows that he certainly does not want his children living this way.
He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction : into a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature.
He becomes more callous, the population becomes more hostile, the situation grows more tense, and the police force is increased.
One day, to everyone's astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything blows up.
Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed, editorials, speeches, and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land, demanding to know what happened.
What happened is that Negroes want to be treated like men.
Negroes want to be treated like men : a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words.
People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud, and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable.
The idea seems to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions.
A kind of panic paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on the edge of a steep place.
I once tried to describe to a very well-known American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South.
My recital disturbed him and made him indignant ; and he asked me in perfect innocence, why don't all the Negroes in the South move North?
I tried to explain what has happened, unfailingly, whenever a significant body of Negroes move North.
They do not escape Jim Crow : they merely encounter another, not-less-deadly variety.
They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side ; they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem.
The pressure within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion is always violent.
White people hold the line as long as they can, and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical violence.
But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto.
The white people fall back bitterly before the black horde ; the landlords make a tidy profit by raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but dispensing with the upkeep ; and what has once been a neighborhood turns into a turf.
This is precisely what happened when the Puerto Ricans arrived in their thousands -- and the bitterness thus caused is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.
Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury.
They seem to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it ; and that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse.
Well, in the first place, it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both to know which is worse.
I know Negroes who prefer the South and white Southerners, because at least there, you haven't got to play any guessing games ] the guessing games referred to have driven more than one Negro into the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the river.
I know another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with conviction and with truth, the spirit of the South is the spirit of America.
He was born in the North and did his military training in the South.
He did not, as far as I can gather, find the South worse ; he found it, if anything, all too familiar.
In the second place, though, even if Birmingham is worse, no doubt Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several miles, and Buchenwald was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history of the world.
The world has never lacked for horrifying examples ; but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification for our own crimes.
This perpetual justification empties the heart of all human feeling.
The emptier our hearts become, the greater will be our crimes.
Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly backward region, but a part of this country, and what happens there concerns every one of us.
As far as the color problem is concerned, there is but one great difference between the Southern white and the Northerner : the Southerner remembers, historically and in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and they loved him.
Historically, the flaming sword laid across this Eden is the Civil War.
Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual coming of age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos are set up between himself and his past.
Everything, thereafter, is permitted him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need.
The resulting, indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the basis of the Southern hysteria.
None of this is true for the Northerner.
Negroes represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps, the dangers of carnality.
He never sees Negroes.
Southerners see them all the time.
Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners are never really thinking of anything else.
Negroes are, therefore, ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South, and suffer hideously in both places.
Neither the Southerner nor the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man.
It seems to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be considered either as a kind of ward ( in which case we are told how many Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year and how few, comparatively, were lynched ), or as a victim ( in which case we are promised that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our kids ).
They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change -- cannot change -- until the North changes.
The country will not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really means by freedom.
In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and the world shrinks around us.
It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own : in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself.
Walk through the streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become.
4.
East River, downtown : postscript to a letter from Harlem the fact that American Negroes rioted in the U.*n. while Adlai Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white Americans.
Stevenson's speech, and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery, were both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the day before, of Patrice Lumumba.
Stevenson stated, in the course of his address, that the United States was against colonialism.
God knows what the African nations, who hold 25 per cent of the voting stock in the U.*n. were thinking -- they may, for example, have been thinking of the U.*s. abstention when the vote on Algerian freedom was before the Assembly -- but I think I have a fairly accurate notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking.
I had intended to be there myself.
It was my first reaction upon hearing of Lumumba's death.
I was curious about the impact of this political assassination on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had -- has -- captured the popular imagination there.
I was curious to know if Lumumba's death, which is surely among the most sinister of recent events, would elicit from our side anything more than the usual, well-meaning rhetoric.
And I was curious about the African reaction.
However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U.*n. gallery.
Had I been there, I, too, in the eyes of most Americans, would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists.
The climate and the events of the last decade, and the steady pressure of the cold war, have given Americans yet another means of avoiding self-examination, and so it has been decided that the riots were Communist inspired.
Nor was it long, naturally, before prominent Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U.*n. rioters do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community.
According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing view, these rioters were merely a handful of irresponsible, Stalinist-corrupted provocateurs.
I find this view amazing.
It is a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict.
One has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions.
The first question is : would I like to live here?
And the second question is : why don't those who now live here move out?
The answer to both questions is immediately obvious.
Unless one takes refuge in the theory -- however disguised -- that Negroes are, somehow, different from white people, I do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.
Now, I do not doubt that, among the people at the U.*n. that day, there were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the most cynical motives.
Wherever there is great social discontent, these people are, sooner or later, to be found.
Their presence is not as frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity.
What I find appalling -- and really dangerous -- is the American assumption that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest.
It is a notion which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes can make no move unless they are manipulated.
Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until the early fifties.
Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movies of the nineties.
Each film consisted of fifty feet, which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen.
As long as audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little reason to adventure further.
Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be found in such urban areas as Times Square.
Brief snips of actual events were shown : parades, dances, street scenes.
The sensational and frightening enjoyed popularity : a train rushes straight at the audience, or a great wave threatens to break over the seats.
An early Edison production was The Execution Of Mary, Queen Of Scots.
The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold ; the headsman swung his axe ; the head dropped off ; end of film.
An early film by a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.
In the field of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded, one-minute shows.
In response, the industry allowed the discovery of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies the essential form they have had to this day.
Despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films, and travelogues, despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development as Cinerama, the movies are at heart a form of fiction, like the play, the novel, or the short story.
Moreover, the most artistically successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative form from the fiction feature.
Thus such great American documentaries as The River and The Plow That Broke The Plains were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures.
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French magician, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin S. Porter.
Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained since, even in the most inept hands.
Narrative time and film time Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a magician, discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain part of the vocabulary of film.
One of these is the dissolve, which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene.
As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding scene begins to appear.
For a moment or two, both scenes are present simultaneously, one growing weaker, one growing stronger.
In a series of fairy tales and fantasies, Melies demonstrated that the film is superbly equipped to tell a straightforward story, with beginning, middle and end, complications, resolutions, climaxes, and conclusions.
Immediately, the film improved and it improved because in narrative it found a content based on time to complement its own unbreakable connection with time.
Physically, a movie is possible because a series of images is projected one at a time at such a speed that the eye remembers the one that has gone before even as it registers the one now appearing.
Linking the smoothly changing images together, the eye itself endows them with the illusion of movement.
The projection time of painting and sculpture is highly subjective, varying from person to person and even varying for a given person on different occasions.
So is the time of the novel.
The drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fixed time, but the time is fixed by the director and the players, the conductor and the instrumentalists, subject, therefore, to much variation, as record collectors well know.
The time of the motion picture is fixed absolutely.
The film consists of a series of still, transparent photographs, or frames, 35-mm.-wide.
Each frame comes between the light and the lens and is individually projected on the screen, at the rate, for silent movies, of 16 frames per second, and, for sound films, 24 frames per second.
This is the rate of projection ; it is also the rate of photographing.
Time is built into the motion picture, which cannot exist without time.
Now time is also the concern of the fictional narrative, which is, at its simplest, the story of an action with, usually, a beginning, a middle, and an end -- elements which demand time as the first condition for their existence.
The moving picture of the train or the wave coming at the audience is, to be sure, more intense than a still picture of the same subject, but the difference is really one of degree ; the cinematic element of time is merely used to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo.
In narrative, time is essential, as it is in film.
Almost everything about the movies that is peculiarly of the movies derives from a tension created and maintained between narrative time and film time.
This discovery of Melies was vastly more important than his sometimes dazzling, magician's tricks produced on film.
It was Porter, however, who produced the very first movie whose name has lived on through the half century of film history that has since ensued.
The movie was The Great Train Robbery and its effects on the young industry and art were all but incalculable.
Overnight, for one thing, Porter's film multiplied the standard running time of movies by ten.
The Great Train Robbery is a one-reel film.
One reel -- from eight to twelve minutes -- became the standard length from the year of Robbery, 1903, until Griffith shattered that limit forever with Birth Of A Nation in 1915.
The reel itself became and still is the standard of measure for the movies.
The material of the Porter film is simplicity itself ; much of it has continued to be used over the years and the heart of it -- good guys and bad guys in the old West -- pretty well dominated television toward the end of the 1950's.
A band of robbers enters a railroad station, overpowers and ties up the telegraph operator, holds up the train and escapes.
A posse is formed and pursues the robbers, who, having made their escape, are whooping it up with some wild, wild women in a honky-tonk hide-out.
The robbers run from the hide-out, take cover in a wooded declivity, and are shot dead by the posse.
As a finale is appended a close-up of one of the band taking aim and firing his revolver straight at the audience.
All this is simple enough, but in telling the story Porter did two important things that had not been done before.
Each scene is shot straight through, as had been the universal custom, from a camera fixed in a single position, but in the outdoor scenes, especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaws, Porter's camera position breaks, necessarily, with the camera position standard until then, which had been, roughly, that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play.
The plane of the action in the scene is not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen.
If the change, at first sight, seems minor, we may recall that it took the Italian painters about two hundred years to make an analogous change, and the Italian painters, by universal consent, were the most brilliant group of geniuses any art has seen.
In that apparently simple shift Porter opened the way to the sensitive use of the camera as an instrument of art as well as a mechanical recording device.
He did more than that.
He revealed the potential value of the cut as the basic technique in the art of the film.
Cutting, of course, takes place automatically in the creation of a film.
The meaning of the word is quite physical, to begin with.
The physical film is cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence, and the cut edge is joined physically, by cement, to the cut edge of the beginning of the next sequence.
If, as a home movie maker, you shoot the inevitable footage of your child taking its first steps, you have merely recorded an historical event.
If, in preparing that shot for the inevitable showing to your friends, you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frames of the child's grandmother watching this event, you have begun to be an artist in film ; you are employing the basic technique of film ; you are cutting.
This is what Porter did.
As the robbers leave the looted train, the film suddenly cuts back to the station, where the telegrapher's little daughter arrives with her father's dinner pail only to find him bound on the floor.
She dashes around in alarm.
The two events are taking place at the same time.
Time and space have both become cinematic.
We leap from event to event -- including the formation of the posse -- even though the events, in reality are taking place not in sequence but simultaneously, and not near each other but at a considerable distance.
The chase as a standard film device probably dates from The Great Train Robbery, and there is a reason for the continued popularity of the device.
The chase in itself is a narrative ; it presumes both speed and urgency and it demands cutting -- both from pursued to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both.
The simple, naked idea of one man chasing another is of its nature better fitted for the film than it is for any other form of fiction.
The cowboy films, the cops and robbers films, and the slapstick comedy films culminating in an insane chase are not only catering to what critics may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence ; these films and these sequences are also seeking out -- instinctively or by design -- the peculiarly cinematic elements of narrative.
The creator of the art of the film : D.*w. Griffith there still remained the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art.
The man was D.*w. Griffith.
When he came to the movies -- more or less by accident -- they were still cheap entertainment capable of enthralling the unthinking for an idle few minutes.
In about seven years Griffith either invented or first realized the possibilities of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker.
Before he was forty Griffith had created the art of the film.
Not that there had not been attempts, mostly European, to do exactly that.
But in general the European efforts to make an art of the entertainment had ignored the slowly emerging language of the film itself.
Staggeringly condensed versions of famous novels and famous plays were presented.
Great actors and actresses -- the most notable being Sarah Bernhardt -- were hired to repeat their stage performances before the camera.
In all of this extensive and expensive effort, the camera was downgraded to the status of recording instrument for art work produced elsewhere by the actor or by the author.
The phonograph today, for all its high fidelity and stereophonic sound, is precisely what the early art purveyors in the movies wished to make of the camera.
Not surprisingly, this approach did not work.
The effort produced a valuable record of stage techniques in the early years of the century and some interesting records of great theater figures who would otherwise be only names.
But no art at all was born of the art effort in the early movies.
In general, religious interest seems to exist in all parts of the metropolis ; congregational membership, however, is another thing.
A congregation survives only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership ; that is, when it can preserve economic integration.
Religious faith can be considered a necessary condition of membership in a congregation, since the decision to join a worshiping group requires some motive force, but faith is not a sufficient condition for joining ; the presence of other members of similar social and economic level is the sufficient condition.
The breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city areas and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city churches.
Central cities reveal two adverse features for the major denominations : ( 1 ) central cities tend to be areas of residence for lower social classes ; ( 2 ) central cities tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition.
The central city areas, in other words, exhibit the two characteristics which violate the life principle of congregations of the major denominations : they have too few middle-class people ; they mix middle-class people with lower-class residents.
Central city areas have become progressively poorer locales for the major denominations since the exodus of middle-class people from most central cities.
With few exceptions, the major denominations are rapidly losing their hold on the central city.
The key to Protestant development, therefore, is economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation.
Members of higher and lower social status often cluster around this nucleus, so that Protestant figures on social class give the impression of spread over all social classes ; but this is deceptive, for the core of membership is concentrated in a single social and economic stratum.
The congregation perishes when it is no longer possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood ; moreover, residential mobility is so high in metropolitan areas that churches have to recruit constantly in their core stratum in order to survive ; they can lose higher- and lower-status members from the church without collapsing, but they need adequate recruits for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration.
The congregation is first and foremost an economic peer group ; it is secondarily a believing and worshiping fellowship.
If it were primarily a believing fellowship, it would recruit believers from all social and economic ranks, something which most congregations of the New Protestantism ( with a few notable exceptions ) have not been able to do.
They survive only when they can recruit social and economic peers.
The vulnerability of Protestant congregations to social differences has often been attributed to the folksy spirit of Protestant religious life ; in fact, a contrast is often drawn in this regard with the impersonal Roman Catholic parish.
We have seen that the folksy spirit is confined to economic peers ; consequently, the vulnerability to social difference should not be attributed to the stress on personal community in Protestant congregations ; actually, there is little evidence of such personal community in Protestant congregations, as we shall see in another connection.
The vulnerability of Protestantism to social differences stems from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life, where the congregation is a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform, therefore, to the principle of economic integration.
This fact is evident in the recruitment of new members.
Mission as co-optation the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be seen in the missionary outreach of the major denominations.
There is much talk in theological circles about the Church as Mission and the Church's Mission ; theologians have been stressing the fact that the Church does not exist for its own sake but as a testimony in the world for the healing of the world.
A crucial question, therefore, is what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan Protestantism.
If economic integration really shapes congregational life, then evangelism should be a process of extending economic integration.
The task of a congregation would be defined, according to economic integration, as the work of co-opting individuals and families of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation.
( co-optation means to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy ; it can also mean the assimilation of centers of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization.
) in a mobile society, congregational health depends on a constant process of recruitment ; this recruitment, however, must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation ; therefore, the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation -- like elements will have to be assimilated.
Evangelism and congregational outreach have not been carefully studied in the churches ; one study in Pittsburgh, however, has illuminated the situation.
In a sample of new members of Pittsburgh churches, almost 60 per cent were recruited by initial contacts with friendly members.
If we add to these contacts with friendly members the contacts with an organization of the church ( 11.2 per cent of the cases ), then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment is through friendly contact.
On the surface, this seems a sound approach to Christian mission : members of the congregation show by their friendly attitudes that they care for new people ; the new people respond in kind by joining the church.
Missionary outreach by friendly contact looks somewhat different when one reflects on what is known about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhoods ; the majority of such contacts are with people of similar social and economic position ; association by level of achievement is the dominant principle of informal relations.
This means that the antennae of the congregation are extended into the community, picking up the wave lengths of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation ; the mission of the church is actually a process of informal co-optation ; the lay ministry is a means to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation.
Churches can be strengthened through this process of co-optation so long as the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration ; once the pool of recruits diminishes, the congregation is helpless -- friendly contacts no longer keep it going.
The transmutation of mission to co-optation is further indicated by the insignificance of educational activities, worship, preaching, and publicity in reaching new members.
The proclamation of the churches is almost totally confined to pastoral contacts by the clergy ( 17.3 per cent of new members ) and friendly contacts by members ( over two thirds if organizational activities are included ).
Publicity accounted for 1.1 per cent of the initial contacts with new members.
In general, friendly contact with a member followed by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the churches, making it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation is the principal form of mission in the contemporary church ; economic integration and co-optation are the two methods by which Protestants associate with and recruit from the neighborhood.
The inner life of congregations will prosper so long as like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together ; the outer life of congregations -- the suitability of the environment to their survival -- will be propitious so long as the people in the area are of the same social and economic level as the membership.
Economic integration ceases when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mixed or conflict with the status of the congregation.
In a rapidly changing society congregations will run into difficulties repeatedly, since such nice balances of economic integration are hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation.
The fact that metropolitan churches of the major denominations have moved approximately every generation for the last hundred years becomes somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance.
The expense of this type of organization in religious life, when one recalls the number of city churches which deteriorated beyond repair before being abandoned, raises fundamental questions about the principle of Protestant survival in a mobile society ; nonetheless, the prevalence of economic integration in congregations illumines the nature of the Protestant development.
It was observed in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life had split into two trends -- expanding interdependence on an impersonal basis and growing exclusiveness in local communal groupings.
These trends seem to be working at cross-purposes in the metropolis.
Residential associations struggle to insulate themselves against intrusions.
The motifs of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential communities have polarized ; the schism between central city and suburb, Negro and White, blue collar and white collar can be viewed as symptomatic of this deeper polarization of trends in the metropolis.
It now becomes evident that the denominational church is intimately involved with the economy of middle-class culture, for it serves to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential groupings.
The accelerated pace of metropolitan changes has accentuated the drive to conformity in congregations of the major denominations.
This conformity represents a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment.
More than creatures of metropolitan forces, the churches have taken the lead in counteracting the interdependence of metropolitan life, crystallizing and perpetuating the stratification of peoples, giving form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous peoples.
Since American life is committed above all to productivity and a higher standard of economic life, the countervailing forces of residential and religious exclusiveness have fought a desperate, rearguard action against the expanding interdependence of the metropolis.
Consumer communities have suffered at the hands of the productive interests.
Negroes, Puerto Ricans, and rural newcomers are slowly making their way into the cities.
Soon they will fight their way into the lower middle-class suburbs, and the churches will experience the same decay and rebuilding cycle which has characterized their history for a century.
The identification of the basic unit of religious organization -- the parish or congregation -- with a residential area is self-defeating in a modern metropolis, for it simply means the closing of an iron trap on the outreach of the Christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation.
Mission to the metropolis contradicts survival of the congregation in the residential community, because the middle classes are fighting metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion.
This interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projections for the churches.
It could be argued that any fellowship which centers in residential neighborhoods is doomed to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle classes.
It could be argued that only such neighborhoods can sustain religious activity, since worship presupposes some local stabilities.
Whatever projection one makes, the striking fact about congregational and parochial life is the extent to which it is a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people.
Attention will be given in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational churches ; this style is characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle classes.
The keynotes of this style are activism and emphasis on achievements in gaining self-esteem.
These values give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman, dictating the methods of child rearing, determining the pattern of community participation, setting the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness, and informing the congregational life of the major denominations.
Fellowship by likeness and mission by friendly contact form the iron cage of denominational religion.
Its contents are another matter, for they reveal the kinds of interests pursued by the congregation.
What goes on in the cage will occupy our attention under the rubric of the organization church.
An understanding of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serves to illuminate the forces which have fashioned the iron cage of conformity which imprisons the churches in their suburban captivity.
The perplexing question still remains as to why the middle classes turn to the churches as a vehicle of social identity when their clubs and charities should fill the same need.
With capital largely squandered, there seemed to them no other course to pursue.
The directors sold directly to concessionaires, who had to make their profits above the high prices asked by the company.
These concessionaires traded where they wished and generally dealt with the Indians through engages, who might be habitants, voyageurs, or even soldiers.
The concessionaires also had to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they traded, and all pelts were to be taken to company stores and shipped to France in company ships.
The company disposed of the pelts, but with what profit, the records do not show.
In accord with its penurious policy, the company failed to furnish presents to hold the loyalty of the principal Indians.
The lavish use of presents had been effective in expanding the Indian trade of New France and Louisiana in the previous century, and the change in liberality aroused resentment in the minds of the red men.
Traders from the English colonies were far more generous, and Indian loyalty turned to them.
Protests from governors and intendants passed unheeded, and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose Indian insurrections that brought ruin to the company.
In 1721 the King sent three commissioners to Louisiana with full powers to do all that was necessary to protect the colony.
They ordered the raising of troops and obtained 75,000 livres with which to build forts.
They adopted a program by which Louisiana was divided into five districts.
In each of these there was to be a strong military post, and a trading depot to supply the smaller trading houses.
For southeastern Louisiana, Mobile was the principal post, and it was to furnish supplies for trade to the north and east, in the region threatened by British traders.
Mobile was to be the anchor of a chain of posts extending northward to the sources of the Tennessee River.
Fort Toulouse, on the Alabama River, had been erected in 1714 for trade with the Alabamas and Choctaws, but money was available for only one other new post, near the present Nashville, Tennessee, and this was soon abandoned.
West of the Mobile district was the lower Mississippi district, of which New Orleans was headquarters.
Dependent upon it were posts on the lower Mississippi and the region westward to the frontiers of New Spain.
On the middle Mississippi a principal post was to be located near the mouth of the Arkansas.
It was hoped that to this post would flow a large quantity of furs from the west, principally down the Arkansas River.
On the Ohio or Wabash was to be built another post at the fork of two great rivers.
Other posts would be established up the Ohio and Wabash to protect communication with Canada.
On the upper Mississippi the Illinois post was to be established near Kaskaskia, and dependent posts were to be built on the Missouri, where there are mines in abundance.
Each of the five principal posts was to have a director, responsible to a director-general at New Orleans.
An elaborate system of accounting and reports was worked out, and the trade was to be managed in the most scientific way.
Concessionaires were to be under the supervision of the directors.
Engages must be loyal to the concessionaires, and must serve until the term provided in the engagement was ended.
The habitants were to be encouraged to trade and were to dispose of their pelts to the concessionaires.
Only two principal storehouses were actually established -- one at Mobile, the other at New Orleans.
New Orleans supplied the goods for the trade on the Mississippi, and west of that river, and on the Ohio and Wabash.
Mobile was also supplied by New Orleans with goods for the Mobile district.
The power that Bienville exercised during his first administration cannot be determined.
Regulations for the Indian trade were made by the Conseil superieure de la Louisiane, and Bienville apparently did not have control of that body.
The Conseil even treated the serious matter of British aggression as its business and, on its own authority, sent to disaffected savages merchandise suitable for the peltry trade.
It decided, also, that the purely secular efforts of Bienville were insufficient, and sent missionaries to win the savages from the heathen Carolinians.
During the first administration of Bienville, the peltry trade of the Mobile district was a lucrative source of revenue.
The Alabamas brought in annually 15,000 to 20,000 deerskins, and the Choctaws and Chickasaws brought the total up to 50,000 pelts.
These deerskins were the raw material for the manufacture of leather, and were the only articles which the tribes of this district had to exchange for European goods.
During his first administration, Bienville succeeded in keeping Carolina traders out of the Alabama country and the Choctaw country.
The director of the post at Mobile kept an adequate amount of French goods, of a kind to which they were accustomed, to supply the Indian needs.
The Alabama and Tombigbee rivers furnished a highway by which goods could be moved quickly and cheaply.
De La Laude, commander of the Alabama post, had the friendship of the natives, and was able to make them look upon the British as poor competitors.
Diron D'*artaguette, the most prominent trader in the district, was energetic and resourceful, but his methods often aroused the ire of the French governors.
He became, after a time, commander of a post on the Alabama River, but his operations extended from Mobile throughout the district, and he finally obtained a monopoly of the Indian trade.
The Chickasaws were the principal source of trouble in the Mobile district.
Their territory lay to the north, near the sources of the Alabama, the Tombigbee, the Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers, and was easily accessible to traders among the near-by Cherokees.
In 1720 some Chickasaws massacred the French traders among them, and did not make peace for four years.
Venturesome traders, however, continued to come to them from Mobile, and to obtain a considerable number of pelts for the French markets.
British traders from South Carolina incited the Indians against the French, and there developed French and British Factions in the tribe.
The Chickasaws finally were the occasion for the most disastrous wars during the French control of Louisiana.
To hold them was an essential part of French policy, for they controlled the upper termini of the routes from the north to Mobile.
They threatened constantly to give the British a hold on this region, from whence they could move easily down the rivers to the French settlements near the Gulf.
Bienville realized that if the French were to hold the southeastern tribes against the enticements of British goods, French traders must be able to offer a supply as abundant as the Carolinians and at reasonable prices.
His urgings brought some results.
The Company of the Indies promised to send over a supply of Indian trading goods, and to price them more cheaply in terms of deerskins.
But it coupled with this a requirement that Indians must bring their pelts to Mobile and thus save all costs of transportation into and out of the Indian country.
The insistence of Bienville upon giving liberal prices to the Indians, in order to drive back the Carolina traders, was probably a factor that led to his recall in 1724.
For two years his friend and cousin, Boisbriant, remained as acting governor and could do little to stem the Anglican advance.
Although he incited a few friendly Indians to pillage the invaders, and even kill some of them, the Carolina advance continued.
The company was impressed with some ideas of the danger from Carolina, and when Perier came over as governor in 1727, he was given special instructions regarding the trade of the Mobile district.
But the Company of the Indies, holding to its program of economy, made no arrangements to furnish better goods at attractive prices.
To the directors the problem appeared a matter of intrigue or diplomacy.
Perier attempted to understand the problem by sending agents to inquire among the Indians.
These agents were to ascertain the difference between English and French goods, and the prices charged the Indians.
They were to conciliate the unfriendly savages, and, wherever possible, to incite the natives to pillage the traders from Carolina.
They were to promise fine presents to the loyal red men, as well as an abundant supply of trading goods at better prices than the opposition was offering.
Perier's intrigues gained some successes.
The savages divided into two factions ; one was British and the other, French.
So hostile did these factions become that, among the Choctaws, civil war broke out.
Perier's efforts, however, were on the whole ineffective in winning back the tribes of the Mobile district, and he decided to send troops into the troubled country.
He asked the government for two hundred soldiers, who were to be specifically assigned to arrest English traders and disloyal Indians.
In spite of the company's restrictions, he planned to build new posts in the territory.
He asked also for more supplies to trade at a low price for the Indians' pelts.
No help came from the crown, and Perier, in desperation, gave a monopoly of the Indian trade in the district to D'*artaguette.
D'*artaguette went vigorously to work, and gave credit to many hunters.
But they brought back few pelts to pay their debts, and soon French trade in the region was at an end.
Perier finally, in one last bid in 1730, cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in France.
The Indians were not impressed and held to the Carolina traders, who swarmed over the country, almost to the Mississippi.
With the loss of the Mobile trade, which ended all profits from Louisiana, the Natchez Indians revolted.
They destroyed a trading house and pillaged the goods, and harassed French shipping on the Mississippi.
The war to subdue them taxed the resources of the colony and piled up enormous debts.
In January, 1731, the company asked the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony.
It stated that it had lost 20,000,000 livres in its operations, and apparently blamed its poor success largely on the Indian trade.
It offered to surrender its right to exclusive trade, but asked an indemnity.
The King accepted the surrender and fixed the compensation of the company at 1,450,000 livres.
Thenceforth, the commerce of Louisiana was free to all Frenchmen.
Company rule in Louisiana left the colony without fortifications, arms, munitions, or supplies.
The difficulties of trade had ruined many voyageurs, and numbers of them had gone to live with the natives and rear half-blood families.
Others left the country, and there was no one familiar with the Indian trade.
If this trade should be resumed, the habitants who had come to be farmers or artisans, and soldiers discharged from the army, must be hardened to the severe life of coureurs de bois.
This was a slow and difficult course, and French trade suffered from the many mistakes of the new group of traders.
These men were without capital or experience.
Perier and Salmon, the intendant, wished either to entrust the trade to an association of merchants or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individuals who would repay their debts with pelts.
Bienville, who returned to succeed Perier in 1732, objected that the merchants would not accept the responsibility of managing a trade in which they could see no hope of profits.
He reported, too, that among the habitants there were none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrusting them with the King's goods.
He did find some to trust, however, and he employed the King's soldiers to trade.
With no company to interfere, he kept close control over all the traders.
In order to compete with English traders, Bienville radically changed the price schedule.
The King should expect no profit, and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in France, which would cover the expense of transportation and handling, was all he charged the traders.
They would not be pleased to have it published back home that they planned a frolic in Paris or Hong Kong at the Treasury's expense.
They would be particularly displeased with the State Department if it were the source of such reports.
Few things are more perilous for the State Department than a displeased congressman.
The reason for this bears explaining for those who may wonder why State spends so much of its diplomatic energy on Congress when the Russians are so available.
First, the State Department is unique among government agencies for its lack of public supporters.
The farmers may be aroused if Congress cuts into the Agriculture Department's budget.
Businessmen will rise if Congress attacks the Commerce Department.
Labor restrains undue brutality toward the Labor Department ; the Chamber of Commerce, assaults upon the Treasury.
A kaleidoscope of pressure groups make it unpleasant for the congressman who becomes ugly toward the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.
The congressman's patriotism is always involved when he turns upon the Defense Department.
Tampering with the Post Office may infuriate every voter who can write.
With all these agencies, the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim his sails accordingly.
No such political restraint subdues his blood when he gazes upon the State Department in anger.
In many sections he may even reap applause from press and public for giving it a good lesson.
After all, the money dispensed by State goes not to the farmer, the laborer, or the businessman, but to foreigners.
Not only do these foreigners not vote for American congressmen ; they are also probably ungrateful for Uncle's Sam's bounty.
And are not the State Department men who dispense this largesse merely crackpots and do-gooders who have never met a payroll?
Will not the righteous congressman be cheered at the polls if he reminds them to get right with America and if he saves the taxpayer some money by spoiling a few of their schemes?
The chances are excellent that he will.
The result is that the State Department's perpetual position before Congress is the resigned pose of the whipping boy who expects to be kicked whenever the master has had a dyspeptic outing with his wife.
People in this position do not offend the master by relating his peccadilloes to the newspapers.
State keeps the junketeering list a secret.
The Department expects and receives no thanks from Congress for its discretion.
Congress is a harsh master.
State is expected to arrange the touring Cicero's foreign itinerary ; its embassies are expected to supply him with reams of local money to pay his way ; embassy workers are expected to entertain him according to his whim, frequently with their savings for the children's college tuition.
But come the next session of Congress, State can expect only that its summer guest will bite its hand when it goes to the Capitol asking money for diplomatic entertaining expenses abroad or for living expenses for its diplomats.
The congressman who, in Paris, may have stuffed his wallet with enough franc notes to paper the roof of Notre-*dame will systematically scream that a $200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary is tantamount to debauchery of the Treasury.
In the matter of money State's most unrelenting watchdog during the Eisenhower years was Representative John J. Rooney, of Brooklyn, who controlled the purse for diplomatic administrative expenses.
Diplomats stayed up nights thinking of ways to attain peaceful coexistence, not with Nikita Khrushchev, but with John Rooney.
Nothing worked.
In the most confidential whispers ambassadors told of techniques they had tried to bring Rooney around -- friendly persuasion, groveling abasement, pressure subtly exerted through other powerful congressmen, tales of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps.
Rooney remained untouched.
The trouble, explained Loy Henderson, then Deputy Undersecretary for Administration, is that when we get into an argument with him about this thing, it always turns out that Rooney knows more about our budget than we do.
One year the Department collected a file of case histories to document its argument that men in the field were paying the government's entertainment bills out of personal income.
News of the project reached the press.
Next day, reports went through the Department that Rooney had been outraged by what he considered a patent attempt to put public pressure on him for increased entertainment allowances and had sworn an oath that, that year, expense allowances would not rise a dollar.
They didn't.
The Department's constant fight with the House for money is a polite minuet compared with its periodic bloody engagements with the Senate.
Armed with constitutional power to negate the Executive's foreign policy, the Senate carries a big stick and is easily provoked to use it on the State Department's back, or on the head of the Secretary of State.
With its power to investigate, the Senate can paralyze the Secretary by keeping him in a state of perpetual testimony before committees, as it did with Dean Acheson.
John Foster Dulles escaped by keeping his personal show on the road and because Lyndon Johnson, who was then operating the Senate, refused to let it become an Inquisition.
During Dulles's first two years in office, while Republicans ran the Senate, the Department was at the mercy of men who had thirsted for its blood since 1945.
An internal police operation managed by Scott Mc*leod, a former F.*b.*i. man installed as security officer upon congressional insistence, was part of the vengeance.
So was the attack upon Charles E. Bohlen when Eisenhower appointed him Ambassador to Moscow.
The principal mauler, however, was Senator Joseph Mc*carthy.
Where Acheson had fought a gallant losing battle for the Department, Dulles fed the crocodile with his subordinates.
Fretting privately but eschewing public defense of his terrorized bureaucrats, Dulles remained serene and detached while the hatchet men had their way.
In view of Eisenhower's reluctance to concede that anything was amiss in the Terror, it is doubtful that heroic intervention by Dulles could have produced anything but disaster for him and the country's foreign policy.
In any event, the example of Acheson's trampling by the Senate did not encourage Dulles to provoke it.
He elected to get along.
During this dark chapter in State Department history, men who had offered foreign-policy ideas later proven wrong by events filled the tumbrels sent up to Capitol Hill.
Their old errors of judgment were equated, in the curious logic of the time, with present treasonous intent.
Their successors, absorbing the lesson, made it a point to have few ideas.
This, in turn, brought a new fashion in senatorial criticism as the Democrats took control.
In the new style, the Department was berated as intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital ideas needed to outwit the Russians.
For three or four years in the mid-1950's, this complaint was heard rumbling up from the Senate floor whenever there was a dull legislative afternoon.
It became smart to say that the fault was with Dulles because he would not countenance thinking done by anyone but himself.
An equally tenable thesis is that the dearth of new thought was created by the Senate's own penchant for crucifying anyone whose ideas seem unorthodox to the next generation.
Getting along with foreigners there are ninety-eight foreign embassies and legations in Washington.
They range from the Soviet Embassy on Sixteenth Street, a gray shuttered pile suggesting a funeral-accessories display house, to what Congressman Rooney has called that monstrosity on Thirty-fourth Street, the modern cement-and-glass chancery of the Belgians.
Here is the world of the chauffeured limousine and the gossip reporter, of caviar on stale crackers and the warm martini, of the poseur, the spy, the party crasher, and the patriot, of the rented tails, the double cross, and the tired Lothario.
Into its chanceries each day pour reports from ministries around the earth and an endless stream of home-office instructions on how to handle Uncle Sam in an infinite variety of contingencies.
Here are hatched plans for getting a share of the American bounty, the secret of the anti-missile missile, or an invitation to dinner.
Out of it each week go hundreds of thousands of words purporting to inform home ministries about what is really happening inside Washington.
Some, like the British and the French, maintain an elaborate system of personal contacts and have experts constantly studying special areas of the American scene.
Other embassies cable home the New York Times without changing a comma.
Each has its peculiar style.
The Soviet Embassy is popularly regarded as Russian espionage headquarters.
When Ambassador Mikhail Menshikov took it over in 1957 from Georgi Zaroubin, he made a determined effort to change this idea.
Menshikov hit Washington with a *j announcer's grin and a hearty handclasp.
To everyone's astonishment he seemed no more like the run-of-the-mine Russian ambassador than George Babbitt was like Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov.
Where his predecessors had glowered, Menshikov smiled.
Where they had affected the bleak social style of embalmers' assistants, Menshikov went abroad gorgeous in white tie and tails.
Overnight he became the most available man in Washington.
Speeches by the Soviet ambassador became the vogue as he obliged rural Maryland Rotarians and National Press Club alike.
In Senator Joseph Mc*carthy's phrase, it was the most unheard-of thing ever heard of.
A newspaperman who met him at a reception swore that he asked Menshikov : what should we call you?
And that Menshikov replied : just call me Mike.
Smilin' Mike was the sobriquet Washington gave him.
His English was usable and he used it fearlessly.
Toasting in champagne one night at the embassy, he hoisted his glass to a senator's wife and gaily cried : up your bottom ] for a few giddy months that coincided with one of Moscow's smiling moods, he was the sensation of Washington.
At the State Department, hard-bitten Russian experts complained that the Capitol was out of its wits.
Newspaper punditry was inspired to remind everyone that Judas, too, had been able to smile.
The Menshikov interlude ended as larks with the Russians usually end.
Finding peaceful coexistence temporarily unsuitable because of domestic politics, Moscow resumed scowling and Smilin' Mike dropped quietly out of the press except for an occasional story reporting that he had been stoned somewhere in the Middle West.
The most inscrutable embassies are the Arabs', and the most inscrutable of the Arabs are the Saudi Arabians.
When King Saud visited Washington, the overwhelming question consuming the press was the size of his family.
Rumor had it that his children numbered in the hundreds.
The State Department was little help on this, or on much else about Saudi Arabia.
A reporter who consulted a Middle East Information officer for routine vital statistics got nowhere until the State Department man produced from his bottom desk drawer a brochure published by the Arabian-*american Oil Company.
This is where I get my information from, he confided.
But bring it right back.
It's the only copy I've got.
The size of Saud's family was still being debated when the King appeared for his first meeting with Eisenhower.
When it ended, a dusky sheik in desert robes flowed into Hagerty's office to report on the interview.
The massed reporters brushed aside the customary bromides about Saudi-*american friendship to bore in on the central question.
How many children did the King have?
Twenty-one, replied the sheik.
And how many of these were sons?
Twenty-five, the sheik replied.
Do you mean to tell us, a reporter asked, that the King has twenty-one children, twenty-five of whom are sons?
The sheik smiled and murmured : that is precisely correct.
The Egyptians are noted for elusiveness of language.
When Dag Hammarskjold was negotiating the Middle East peace after Israel's 1956 invasion of Egypt, he soon found himself speaking the mysterious phrases of Cairo, a language as anarchic as Casey Stengel's.
The reports of President Nasser's pledges which Hammarskjold was relaying from Cairo to Washington became increasingly incomprehensible to other diplomats, including the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mrs. Golda Meir.
Finally he reported that Nasser was ready to make a concrete commitment in return for Israeli concessions.
The deep water is used by many people, but it is always clean, for the washing is done outside.
I know now why our Japanese friends were surprised when they walked into our bathroom.
Of course, most toilets are Eastern style -- at floor level -- but even when they are raised to chair height, they are actually outside toilets -- inside.
A few newer homes have Western flush toilets, but even with running water, they are usually Eastern style.
The next day I visited International Christian College which has developed since the war under the leadership of people who were interned and who know Japan well.
They are trying to demonstrate some different ways of teaching and learning.
The library has open shelves even in the unbound periodical stockroom.
Spiritual life is cultivated, but students do not need to be Christian.
They have an enviable record of being able to place in employment 100% of their graduates.
In the afternoon Miss Hosaka and her mother invited me to go with them and young Mrs. Kodama to see the famous Spring dances of the Geisha dancers.
Mrs. Hosaka is one of the Japanese women one reads about -- beautiful, artistically talented, an artful manager of her big household -- ( four boys and four girls ), and yet looking like a pampered, gentle Japanese woman.
She was a real experience ] the dances were as beautiful as anything I have ever seen -- they rival the New York Rockettes for scenery and precision as well as imagination.
Because Don was leaving the next day, I spent the evening with him at Asia Center.
The following morning Mr. Morikawa called for me, and we went to visit schools -- kindergarten, middle-school, elementary school, and high school -- Mr. Yoshimoto's school.
There is much more freedom in the schools here than I expected -- some think too much.
There is a great deal of thought being given to the question of moral education in the schools.
With the loss of the Emperor diety in Japan, the people are left in confusion with no God or moral teachings that have strength.
The older parents continued to teach their children traditional principles, but the younger people, who have lost all faith and convictions, are now parents.
There seems to be no purpose in life that is sure -- no certain guiding principles to give stability.
As a result, money is spent quickly and freely, with no thought of its value.
Gambling is everywhere, especially among students.
Parents indulge their children.
The government has recognized the dilemma and is beginning to devise some moral education for the schools -- but the teachers often have no firm conviction and are confused.
I was told that it is quite likely that Japanese soldiers would not fight again -- for why should they?
It will be painful, but interesting, to see what kind of a god these people will create or what strong convictions they will develop.
In the evening the former Oregon State science teachers met for dinner at the New Tokyo Restaurant where I had my first raw fish and found it good.
They suggested several new foods, and usually I found them good, except the sweets, which I think I could learn to like.
Six of the science teachers were present, and we had great fun.
Kyoto after a day at Nikko, Mrs. Kodama put me on the train for Kyoto.
My instructions were that Mr. Nishimo would meet me at the hotel, but instead he and three others were at the station with a very warm welcome.
My hotel rooms on the trip were arranged by Masu and the Japan Travel Bureau and were more elegant than I would have chosen, but it was fun for once to be elegant -- I did explain to the students, however, that this was not my usual style, for their salaries are very small, and it seemed out of place for me to be housed so well.
They understood and teased me a bit about it.
I think I would have been much disappointed in Japan if I had not seen Kyoto, Nara, and Hiroshima.
Kyoto is the ancient capital of Japan and still its cultural center.
It, along with Nara, was untouched by the war -- and is now a beautiful example of the loveliness of prewar Japan.
Here I was accompanied by Mrs. Okamoto ( Fumio's mother ), her son, Mr. Washizu ( a prospective student with whom I have been corresponding for more than a year ), and Mr. Nishima, one of the science teachers.
I arrived at 7:00 a.m. and by 9:00 a.m. I had finished breakfast and was on my way to see what they had planned.
We walked miles and saw various shrines and gardens.
We visited the Okamoto home -- where for the first time I saw the famous tea ceremony.
At 6:00 p.m. we went to the Kyoto Spring dances at the place where these beautiful dances originated.
They were even better than those of Tokyo -- more spectacular and more imaginative.
After a supper of unagi ( rice with eel -- eel which is raised in an ice-cold pond at the foot of Mt. Fuji ), I returned to my beautiful room to sleep as hard as possible to be ready for another busy day.
We started at 9 a.m. to visit the Kyoto University where Mr. Washizu is attending.
I was amazed at the very poor hospital facilities accompanying the medical school.
They apologized for the condition, including dirt and flies, and I was a little at a loss to know what to say.
There seemed to be no excuse?
I don't have the answer yet.
We had tea at Mr. Washizu's home where I learned that he, too, comes from a very wealthy family.
His grandfather is a Buddhist priest ; and he, being the eldest, was supposed to be a priest, but he chose to do differently, and one of his brothers is to become the priest.
This is a significant fact in Japan, for only a few years ago he would have had no choice.
In his big home live four families and thirty people, so it needs to be big.
Also, there are housed here some priceless historical treasures from 400 to 600 years old -- paintings, lacquer, brocade, etc..
He had displayed more of them than usual so that I could enjoy them.
About 100 of the most important items he had already given to the museum.
The house itself is 400 years old with all the craftsmanship of older, less-hurried times.
Nara, Osaka, and Hiroshima Mr. Nishima went with me on the train to Nara.
We passed his house and school on the way.
In Nara I stayed at the hotel where the Prince and Princess had stayed on their honeymoon.
A new red carpet had been laid for their coming, but I walked on it, too.
Here Mr. Yoneda met us after a three-hour train trip from the town where he teaches.
Even though we had walked miles in Kyoto that day, we started out again to see Nara at night.
In the evening both of the men went with me on the train 30 miles to Osaka to put me on the train for Hiroshima.
Again the plan was for me to go alone, but they wouldn't let me.
At Osaka, Mr. Yoneda had to leave us to get the train to his home, but Mr. Nishima and I had an hour and a half before train time to see Osaka at night.
It is the second largest city in Japan, with about four million people.
One spot in Osaka I shall always remember -- the bridge where we stood to watch the reflections of the elaborate neon signs in the still waters of the river.
In the midst of a great busy city, people take time to enjoy the beauty of natural reflection of artificial light.
My train arrived in Hiroshima at the awful hour of 4:45 a.m..
I had planned to go to the hotel by taxi and sleep a little, after which Mr. Uno would arrive and pilot me around.
But there he was at the train with an Oregon State pennant in his hand.
I know now why the students insisted that I go to Hiroshima even when I told them I didn't want to.
They knew that I was still grieving over the tragic event, and they felt that if I could see the recovery and the spirit of the people, who hold no grudge, but who also regret Pearl Harbor, I would be happier and would understand better a new Japan.
There were no words to say this but there was no need.
The teachers of Mr. Uno's school gave me a small gift to thank me for coming.
Hiroshima is a better city than it was before -- in the minds of the people I met was a strong determination for peace and understanding.
I was grateful for their insight into my need for this experience.
A better world may yet come out of Hiroshima.
Tokyo on arriving in Tokyo later we were met by Masu who took us immediately to her university, the Japanese Women's University.
This day was Open House for Parents day, and the girls were busy preparing exhibits and arranging tea tables.
Everything was in an exciting turmoil -- full of anticipation and fun.
It was thrilling to see the effect of an American-trained teacher on Japanese students in a class in Home Planning.
Our Masu is one of the very few architects in Japan who is trying to plan homes around family functions and women's needs.
I am told the time will soon come when women will find it necessary to do most of their own work, and even now it is important to have conveniences for the use of servants.
Many of the features of the homes are the latest modern devices in American homes, but an interesting blend of cultures finds us using Japanese artfulness in our own Western architecture at the same time that the Japanese are adopting Western utility patterns.
At this Women's University we find a monument to a courageous family who believed that Japanese women also should be educated.
Even today there are some doubts about the value of education for Japanese women, but this University continues to grow and to send its students out into the community.
Active alumnae have built a fine building on the campus where members can come and stay for a few days or longer and where they can have their social gatherings and professional meetings.
As far as I am concerned there is continuous piling up of evidence that the creative fresh ideas which are needed in the world are going to be found by educated women unafraid to break traditions.
Masu is also teaching in a municipally-sponsored school for Japanese widows in Tokyo.
Here the women learn to keep house as maids ; they become skilled in cooking and cleaning and in receiving guests.
They learn how to take care of children and sick members of the family.
They have model kitchens, a sick room with a model patient in bed, and a nursery with a life-like doll.
Although the training is only for one month, it is intensive and thorough.
Graduates of this maid's school are much in demand and can always find work immediately.
Occasionally they return for additional training.
Masu's home economics training comes into play as she designs cupboards along modern functional lines for the storage of cleaning materials.
Masu also uses the training she got in an American home where she learned to polish furniture, clean corners, and work effectively in keeping a shiny house.
Her education in the United States, not just in a classroom, but also in an American house with an American housekeeper, stands her in good stead.
University of Tokyo after a fine luncheon in the cafeteria, the kitchen of which Masu had planned, Mr. Washizu and I left to meet representatives of the *j for a visit to the University of Tokyo.
Here again it was vacation time and there were many things I could not see, but I was able to visit with a professor who is famous in Japanese circles and be guided through the grounds by his assistant.
The achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counters not only by wise action by local community leaders but by voluntary action following consultation between Attorney General Rogers and the heads of certain national chain stores should, of course, be applauded.
But for it to be just to attain this same result by means of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of facts contrary to those assumed in the foregoing case.
The suppositions in the previous illustration might be sufficiently altered by establishing a connection between general company practice and local practice in the South, and by establishing such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of stores located in New York and general company policy.
Then the boycott would not be secondary, but a primary one.
It would be directed against the actual location of the unjust policy which, for love's sake and for the sake of justice, must be removed, and, indivisible from this, to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy.
Perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order, by threatening potential injury to its entire economy, to effect an alteration of the policy of its local stores in the matter of segregation.
Such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminating instrument, and therefore of questionable justification.
Action located where the evil is concentrated will prove most decisive and is most clearly legitimate.
Moreover, prudence alone would indicate that, unless the local customs are already ready to fall when pushed, the results of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain stores will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state stores which conform to these customs, leading to greater decentralization and local autonomy within the company, or even ( as the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice ) to its going out of business in certain sections of the country ( as, for that matter, the Quakers, who once had many meetings in the pre-*civil War South, largely went out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue, never to recover a large number of southern adherents ).
In any case, anyone who fails to make significant distinction between primary and secondary applications of economic pressure would in principle already have justified that use of economic boycott as a means which broke out a few years ago or was skillfully organized by White Citizens' Councils in the entire state of Mississippi against every local Philco dealer in that state, in protest against a Philco-sponsored program over a national *j network on which was presented a drama showing, it seemed, a high yellow gal smooching with a white man.
It is true, of course, that the end or objective of this action was different.
But since this is a world in which people disagree about ends and goals and concerning justice and injustice, and since, in a situation where direct action and economic pressure are called for, the justice of the matter has either not been clearly defined by law or the law is not effectively present, there has to be a morality of means applied in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressures or other forms of force.
The need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limited use of economic pressure directed against the actual doers of injustice is clear also in light of the fact that White Citizens' Councils seem resolved to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same means and not ordinarily by physical violence.
An unlimited use of economic pressures for diametrically opposite causes could devastate the pre-conditions of any fellow humanity as surely as this would be destroyed by the use of more obviously brutal means.
The end or aim of the action, of course, is also important, especially where it is not alone a matter of changing community customs but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from stepping forward to claim his legal rights, e.g., against Negroes who register to vote in Fayette County, Tennessee, at the present moment.
Here the recourse is in steps to give economic sustenance to those being despoiled, and to legal remedies.
This, however, is sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict ( if both sides are strong enough ) can be war of all against all no less than if other means are used.
It is also sufficient to show the Christian and any other champion of justice that he needs to make sure not only that his cause is just but also that his conduct is just, i.e., that, if economic pressure has to be resorted to, this be applied directly against those persons directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practices, while, if injury fall upon others, it fall upon them indirectly and secondarily ( however inevitably ) and not by deliberate intent and direct action against them.
It is clear that non-violent resistance is a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in Christian morality, like any other form of resistance.
The language used itself often makes very clear that this is only another form of struggle for victory ( perhaps to be chosen above all others ).
One of the sit-in leaders has said : nobody from the top of Heaven to the bottom of Hell can stop the march to freedom.
Everybody in the world today might as well make up their minds to march with freedom or freedom is going to march over them.
The present writer certainly agrees with that statement, and would also affirm this -- in the order of justice.
However, it is also a Christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrates justice it is not likely to be freedom that marches forward.
And when charity interpenetrates man's struggle for justice and freedom it does not simply surround this with a sentimental good will.
It also definitely fashions conduct in the way explained above, and this means far more than in the choice of non-violent means.
R. B. Gregg has written that non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu, to cause the attacker to lose his moral balance.
He suddenly and unexpectedly loses the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victims would render him ; and again, that the object of non-violent resistance is partly analogous to this object of war -- namely, to demoralize the opponent, to break his will, to destroy his confidence, enthusiasm, and hope.
In another respect it is dissimilar, for non-violent resistance demoralizes the opponent only to re-establish in him a new morale that is firmer because it is based on sounder values.
A trial of strength, however, is made quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engaging in non-violent resistance will be convinced that his action is based on sounder values than those of his opponent ; and in warfare with any means, men commonly disagree over the justice of the cause.
This makes necessary a morality of means, and principles governing the conduct of resistance whenever this is thought to be justified.
The question, then, is whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent means of coercion is to be found in the fact that such conduct demoralizes and overcomes the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establishing him.
Here it is relevant to remember that men commonly regard some causes as more important than their lives ; and to them it will seem insignificant that it is proposed to defeat such causes non-violently.
A technique by which it is proposed to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine his values may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression.
Among Christian groups, the Mennonites have commonly been aware more than others of the fact that the nature of divine charity raises decisively the question of the Christian use of all forms of pressure.
Since the will and word of God are for them concentrated in Christ-like love, it seems clear to them that non-violent resistance is quite another thing.
The primary objective of non-violence, writes the outstanding Mennonite ethicist, is not peace, or obedience to the divine will, but rather certain desired social changes, for personal, or class, or national advantage.
Without agreeing with every phrase in this statement, we must certainly assert the great difference between Christian love and any form of resistance, and then go on beyond the Mennonite position and affirm that Christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principles limiting resistance.
These principles we have now set forth.
Economy in the use of power needs not only to be asserted, but clearly specified ; and when this is done it will be found that the principles governing Christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent means, and apply to both alike, justifying either on occasion and always limiting either action.
Economy in the use of power means more than inflicting a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice opposed.
That would amount to calculating the means and justifying them wholly in terms of their effectiveness in reaching desired goals.
There must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of means of resistance, violent or non-violent.
The justification in Christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lays down its limitation -- in the distinction between the persons against whom pressure is primarily directed, those upon whom it may be permitted also to fall, and those who may never be directly repressed for the sake even of achieving some great good.
In these terms, the economic withdrawal of the Negroes of Nashville, Tennessee, from trading in the center city, for example, was clearly justified, since these distinctions do not require that only people subjectively guilty be singled out.
We may now take up for consideration a hard case which seems to require either no action employing economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principles set forth above.
There may be instances in which, if economic pressure is to be undertaken at all, this would have to be applied without discrimination against a whole people.
An excellent article was published recently in the Journal Of The Church Peace Union by a South African journalist on the inhuman economic conditions of the blacks in South Africa, amounting to virtual slavery, and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the United States in these conditions.
Billions of American dollars, not only from capital investors but also from the pockets of U.*s. taxpayers, this author states, are being poured into South Africa to support a system dedicated to the oppression, the persecution, and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skins happens not to be white.
Both the conditions and the complicity are documented in considerable detail.
This leads to the conclusion that the fact is inescapable that America does have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue.
Our leadership in a wide economic boycott of South Africa would be not only in accord, it seems, with the moral conscience of America, not to be denied because we also as a people have widespread injustice in the relations of the races in our own country, but also in accord with our law, U.*s. Code Title 19, Section 1307, which forbids the importation of goods made by forced or convict labor.
Not only should this provision be enforced but other economic and political actions might be taken which, this author believes, must surely be supported by every American who values the freedom that has been won for him and whose conscience is not so dominated by the lines in his account books that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation.
Northern liberals are the chief supporters of civil rights and of integration.
They have also led the nation in the direction of a welfare state.
And both in their objectives of non-discrimination and of social progress they have had ranged against them the Southerners who are called Bourbons.
The name presumably derives from the French royal house which never learned and never forgot ; since Bourbon whiskey, though of Kentucky origin, is at least as much favored by liberals in the North as by conservatives in the South.
The nature of the opposition between liberals and Bourbons is too little understood in the North.
The race problem has tended to obscure other, less emotional, issues which may fundamentally be even more divisive.
It is these other differences between North and South -- other, that is, than those which concern discrimination or social welfare -- which I chiefly discuss herein.
I write about Northern liberals from considerable personal experience.
A Southerner married to a New Englander, I have lived for many years in a Connecticut commuting town with a high percentage of artists, writers, publicity men, and business executives of egghead tastes.
Most of them are Democrats and nearly all consider themselves, and are viewed as, liberals.
This is puzzling to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism, because it is clear that these Democrats who are left-of-center are at opposite poles from the liberal Jefferson, who held that the best government was the least government.
Yet paradoxically my liberal friends continue to view Jefferson as one of their patron saints.
When I question them as to what they mean by concepts like liberty and democracy, I find that they fall into two categories : the simpler ones who have simply accepted the shibboleths of their faith without analysis ; and the intelligent, cynical ones who scornfully reply that these things don't count any more in the world of to-day.
I am naive, they say, to make use of such words.
I take this to mean that the intelligent -- and therefore necessarily cynical?
-- liberal considers that the need for a national economy with controls that will assure his conception of social justice is so great that individual and local liberties as well as democratic processes may have to yield before it.
This seems like an attitude favoring a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which, under a President of the same stamp, would try to coerce an uncooperative Congress or Supreme Court.
As for states' rights, they have never counted in the thinking of my liberal friends except as irritations of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only as anachronisms.
The American liberal may, in the world of to-day, have a strong case ; but he presents it publicly so enmeshed in hypocrisy that it is not an honest one.
Why, in the first place, call himself a liberal if he is against laissez-faire and favors an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb controls over everybody?
If he attaches little importance to personal liberty, why not make this known to the world?
And if he is so scornful of the rights of states, why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support?
I am concerned here, however, with the Northern liberal's attitude toward the South.
It appears to be one of intense dislike, which he makes little effort to conceal even in the presence of Southern friends.
His assumption seems to be that any such friends, being tolerable humans, must be more liberal than most Southerners and therefore at least partly in sympathy with his views.
Time's editor, Thomas Griffith, in his book, The Waist-*high Culture, wrote : most of what was different about it ( the Deep South ) I found myself unsympathetic to.
This, for the liberals I know, would be an understatement.
Theirs is no mere lack of sympathy, but something closer to the passionate hatred that was directed against Fascism.
I do not think that my experience would be typical for Southerners living in the North.
In business circles, usually conservative, this sort of atmosphere would hardly be found.
But in our case -- and neither my wife nor I have extreme views on integration, nor are we given to emotional outbursts -- the situation has ruined one or two valued friendships and come close to wrecking several more.
In fact it has caused us to give serious thought to moving our residence south, because it is not easy for the most objective Southerner to sit calmly by when his host is telling a roomful of people that the only way to deal with Southerners who oppose integration is to send in troops and shoot the bastards down.
Accounts have been published of Northern liberals in the South up against segregationist prejudice, especially in state-supported universities where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view.
But these accounts do not show that Northerners have been subjected to embarrassment or provocation by Yankee-hatred displayed in social gatherings.
From my wife's experience and other sources, this seems to be rarely encountered in educated circles.
The strong feeling is certainly there ; but there is a leavening of liberalism among college graduates throughout the South, especially among those who studied in the North.
And social relations arising out of business ties impose courtesy, if not sympathy, toward resident and visiting Northerners.
Also, among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent Southern attitude on most social problems.
There are of course many Souths ; but for this discussion the most important division is between those who have been reconstructed and those who haven't.
My definition of this much abused adjective is that a reconstructed rebel is one who is glad that the North won the War.
Nobody knows how many Southerners there are in this category.
I suspect that there are far more unreconstructed ones than the North likes to believe.
I never heard of a poll being taken on the question.
No doubt such a thing would be considered unpatriotic.
Prior to 1954 I imagine that a majority of Southerners would have voted against the Confederacy.
Since the Supreme Court's decision of that year this is more doubtful ; and if a poll had been taken immediately following the dispatch of troops to Little Rock I believe the majority would have been for the Old South.
Belief in the traditional way of life persists much more in the older states than in the new ones.
Probably a larger percentage of Virginians and South Carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere, with Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama following along after them.
Old attitudes are held more tenaciously in the Tidewater than the Piedmont ; so that a line running down the length of the South marking the upper limits of tidewater would roughly divide the Old South from the new, but with, of course, important minority enclaves.
The long-settled areas of states like Virginia and South Carolina developed the ante-bellum culture to its richest flowering, and there the memory is more precious, and the consciousness of loss the greater.
Also, we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such as the coastal lowlands centering on Charleston had closer ties with England and the West Indies than with the North even after independence.
The social and psychological consequences of this continue to affect the area.
In certain respects defeat increased the persistent Anglophilia of the Old South.
Poor where they had once been rich, humbled where they had been arrogant, having no longer any hope of sharing in the leadership of the nation, the rebels who would not surrender in spirit drew comfort from the sympathy they felt extended to them by the mother country.
And no doubt many people in states like the Carolinas and Georgia, which were among the most Tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century, bitterly regretted the revolt against the Crown.
Among Bourbons the racial issue may have less to do with their remaining unreconstructed than other factors.
All Southerners agree that slavery had to go ; but many historians maintain that except for Northern meddling it would have ended in states like Virginia years before it did.
Southern resentment has been over the method of its ending, the invasion, and Reconstruction ; their fears now are of miscegenation and Negro political control in many counties.
But apart from racial problems, the old unreconstructed South -- to use the moderate words favored by Mr. Thomas Griffith -- finds itself unsympathetic to most of what is different about the civilization of the North.
And this, in effect, means most of modern America.
It is hard to see how the situation could be otherwise.
And therein, I feel, many Northerners delude themselves about the South.
For one thing, this is not a subject often discussed or analyzed.
There seems to be almost a conspiracy of silence veiling it.
I suppose the reason is a kind of wishful thinking : don't talk about the final stages of Reconstruction and they will take care of themselves.
Or else the North really believes that all Southerners except a few quaint old characters have come around to realizing the errors of their past, and are now at heart sharers of the American Dream, like everybody else.
If the circumstances are faced frankly it is not reasonable to expect this to be true.
The situation of the South since 1865 has been unique in the western world.
Regardless of rights and wrongs, a population and an area appropriate to a pre-*world-*war- 1 great power have been, following conquest, ruled against their will by a neighboring people, and have had imposed upon them social and economic controls they dislike.
And the great majority of these people are of Anglo-*saxon or Celtic descent.
This is the only case in modern history of a people of Britannic origin submitting without continued struggle to what they view as foreign domination.
The fact is due mainly to international wars, both hot and cold.
In every war of the United States since the Civil War the South was more belligerent than the rest of the country.
So instead of being tests of the South's loyalty, the Spanish War, the two World Wars, and the Korean War all served to overcome old grievances and cement reunion.
And there is no section of the nation more ardent than the South in the cold war against Communism.
Had the situation been reversed, had, for instance, England been the enemy in 1898 because of issues of concern chiefly to New England, there is little doubt that large numbers of Southerners would have happily put on their old Confederate uniforms to fight as allies of Britain.
It is extraordinary that a people as proud and warlike as Southerners should have been as docile as they have.
The North should thank its stars that such has been the case ; but at the same time it should not draw false inferences therefrom.
The two main charges levelled against the Bourbons by liberals is that they are racists and social reactionaries.
There is much truth in both these charges, and not many Bourbons deny them.
Whatever their faults, they are not hypocrites.
Most of them sincerely believe that the Anglo-*saxon is the best race in the world and that it should remain pure.
Many Northeners believe this, too, but few of them will say so publicly.
The Bourbon economic philosophy, moreover, is not very different from that of Northern conservatives.
But those among the Bourbons who remain unreconstructed go much further than this.
They believe that if the South had been let alone it would have produced a civilization superior to that of modern America.
As it is, they consider that the North is now reaping the fruits of excess egalitarianism, that in spite of its high standard of living the American way has been proved inferior to the English and Scandinavian ways, although they disapprove of the socialistic features of the latter.
The South's antipathy to Northern civilization includes such charges as poor manners, harsh accents, lack of appreciation of the arts of living like gastronomy and the use of leisure.
Their own easier, slower tempo is especially dear to Southerners ; and I have heard many say that they are content to earn a half or a third as much as they could up North because they so much prefer the quieter habits of their home town.
In the past, the duties of the state, as Sir Henry Maine noted long ago, were only two in number : internal order and external security.
By prevailing over other claimants for the loyalties of men, the nation-state maintained an adequate measure of certainty and order within its territorial borders.
Outside those limits it asserted, as against other states, a position of sovereign equality, and, as against the inferior peoples of the non-*western world, a position of dominance.
It became the sole subject of international law ( a term which, it is pertinent to remember, was coined by Bentham ), a body of legal principle which by and large was made up of what Western nations could do in the world arena.
( that corpus of law was a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.
Speaking generally, it furthered -- and still tends to further -- the interests of the Western powers.
The enormous changes in world politics have, however, thrown it into confusion, so much so that it is safe to say that all international law is now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social conditions of the present era.
) beyond the two basic tasks mentioned above, no attention was paid by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility, either internally or externally.
This was particularly true in the world arena, which was an anarchical battleground characterized by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empires.
That any sort of duty was owed by his nation to other nations would have astonished a nineteenth-century statesman.
His duty was to his sovereign and to his nation, and an extension to peoples beyond the territorial boundaries was not to be contemplated.
Thus, to cite but one example, the Pax Britannica of the nineteenth century, whether with the British navy ruling the seas or with the City of London ruling world finance, was strictly national in motivation, however much other nations ( e.g., the United States ) may have incidentally benefited.
At the same time, all suggestions that some sort of societal responsibility existed for the welfare of the people within the territorial state was strongly resisted.
Social Darwinism was able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century.
However, in recent decades, for what doubtless are multiple reasons, an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift has occurred in both facets of national activity.
A concept of responsibility is in process of articulation and establishment.
Already firmly implanted internally, it is a growing factor in external matters.
A little more than twenty years ago the American people turned an important corner.
In what has aptly been called a constitutional revolution, the basic nature of government was transformed from one essentially negative in nature ( the night-watchman state ) to one with affirmative duties to perform.
The positive state came into existence.
For lawyers, reflecting perhaps their parochial preferences, there has been a special fascination since then in the role played by the Supreme Court in that transformation -- the manner in which its decisions altered in the switch in time that saved nine, President Roosevelt's ill-starred but in effect victorious Court-packing plan, the imprimatur of judicial approval that was finally placed upon social legislation.
Of greater importance, however, is the content of those programs, which have had and are having enormous consequences for the American people.
Labor relations have been transformed, income security has become a standardized feature of political platforms, and all the many facets of the American version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom.
A national consensus of near unanimity exists that these governmental efforts are desirable as well as necessary.
Ratified in the Republican Party victory in 1952, the Positive State is now evidenced by political campaigns being waged not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be.
The general acceptance of the idea of governmental ( i.e., societal ) responsibility for the economic well-being of the American people is surely one of the two most significant watersheds in American constitutional history.
The other, of course, was the Civil War, the conflict which a century ago insured national unity over fragmentation.
A third, one of at least equal and perhaps even greater importance, is now being traversed : American immersion and involvement in world affairs.
Internal national responsibility, now a truism, need not be documented.
Nevertheless, it may be helpful to cite one example -- that of employment -- for, as will be shown below, it cuts across both facets of the new concept.
Thirty years ago, while the nation was wallowing in economic depression, the prevailing philosophy of government was to stand aside and allow natural forces to operate and cure the distress.
That guiding principle of the Hoover Administration fell to the siege guns of the New Deal ; less than a score of years later Congress enacted the Employment Act of 1946, by which the national government assumed the responsibility of taking action to insure conditions of maximum employment.
Hands-off the economy was replaced by conscious guidance through planning -- the economic side of the constitutional revolution.
In 1961 the first important legislative victory of the Kennedy Administration came when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress won out over a state's-responsibility proposal -- provision was made for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those states afflicted with manpower surplus.
The American people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961.
Internal national responsibility is a societal response to the impact of the Industrial Revolution.
Reduced to its simplest terms, it is an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individuals to cope with the rigors of the era.
National responsibility for individual welfare is a concept not limited to the United States or even to the Western nations.
A measure of its widespread acceptance may be derived from a statement of the International Congress of Jurists in 1959.
Meeting in New Delhi under the auspices of the International Commission of Jurists, a body of lawyers from the free world, the Congress redefined and expanded the traditional Rule of Law to include affirmative governmental duties.
It is noteworthy that the majority of the delegates to the Congress were from the less developed, former colonial nations.
The Rule of Law, historically a principle according everyone his day in court before an impartial tribunal, was broadened substantively by making it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare.
Recognizing that the Rule of Law is a dynamic concept which should be employed not only to safeguard the civil and political rights of the individual in a free society, the Congress asserted that it also included the responsibility to establish social, economic, educational and cultural conditions under which his legitimate aspirations and dignity may be realized.
The idea of national responsibility thus has become a common feature of the nations of the non-*soviet world.
For better or for worse, we all now live in welfare states, the organizing principle of which is collective responsibility for individual well-being.
Whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operates in a nation's external relations is less obvious and more difficult to establish.
The hypothesis ventured here is that it does, and that evidence is accumulating validating that proposition.
The content is not the same, however : rather than individual security, it is the security and continuing existence of an ideological group -- those in the free world -- that is basic.
External national responsibility involves a burgeoning requirement that the leaders of the Western nations so guide their decisions as to further the viability of other friendly nations.
If internal responsibility suggests acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality, then external responsibility implies adherence to principles of ideological supranationalism.
Reference to two other concepts -- nationalism and sovereignty -- may help to reveal the contours of the new principle.
In its beginnings the nation-state had to struggle to assert itself -- internally, against feudal groups, and externally, against the power and influence of such other claimants for loyalty as the Church.
The breakup of the Holy Roman Empire and the downfall of feudalism led, not more than two centuries ago, to the surge of nationalism.
( since the time-span of the nation-state coincides roughly with the separate existence of the United States as an independent entity, it is perhaps natural for Americans to think of the nation as representative of the highest form of order, something permanent and unchanging.
) the concept of nationalism is the political principle that epitomizes and glorifies the territorial state as the characteristic type of socal structure.
But it is more than that.
For it includes the emotional ties that bind men to their homeland and the complex motivations that hold a large group of people together as a unit.
Today, as new nations rise from the former colonial empires, nationalism is one of the hurricane forces loose in the world.
Almost febrile in intensity, the principle has become worldwide in application -- unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak greatest harm.
Historically, however, the concept is one that has been of marked benefit to the people of the Western civilizational group.
By subduing disparate lesser groups the nation has, to some degree at least, broadened the capacity for individual liberty.
Within their confines, moreover, technological and industrial growth has proceeded at an accelerated pace, thus increasing the cornucopia from which material wants can be satisfied.
While the pattern is uneven, some having gained more than others, nationalism has in fact served the Western peoples well.
( whether historical nationalism helped the peoples of the remainder of the world, and whether today's nationalism in the former colonial areas has equally beneficial aspects, are other questions.
) it is one of the ironic quirks of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state are rapidly dissipating at precisely the time that the nation-state attained its highest number ( approximately 100 ).
But it is more than irony : one of the main reasons why nationalism is no longer a tenable concept is because it has spread throughout the planet.
In other words, nationalism worked well enough when it had limited application, both as to geography and as to population ; it becomes a perilous anachronism when adopted on a world-wide basis.
Complementing the political principle of nationalism is the legal principle of sovereignty.
The former receives its legitimacy from the latter.
Operating side by side, together they helped shore up the nation-state.
While sovereignty has roots in antiquity, in its present usage it is essentially modern.
Jean Bodin, writing in the sixteenth century, may have been the seminal thinker, but it was the vastly influential John Austin who set out the main lines of the concept as now understood.
Austin's nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominates much of today's legal and political thinking.
To him, law is the command of the sovereign ( the English monarch ) who personifies the power of the nation, while sovereignty is the power to make law -- i.e., to prevail over internal groups and to be free from the commands of other sovereigns in other nations.
These fundamental ideas -- the indivisibility of sovereignty and its dual ( internal-external ) aspects -- still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power.
The nation-state, then, exemplifies the principle of nationalism and exercises sovereignty : supreme power over domestic affairs and independence from outside control.
In fact, however, both principles have always been nebulous and loosely defined.
High-level abstractions are always difficult to pin down with precision.
That is particularly true of sovereignty when it is applied to democratic societies, in which popular sovereignty is said to exist, and in federal nations, in which the jobs of government are split.
Nevertheless, nationalism and sovereignty are reputed, in the accepted wisdom, to describe the modern world.
Is there a different reality behind the facade?
Does the surface hide a quite different picture?
The short answer to those questions is yes.
Both concepts are undergoing alteration ; to some degree they are being supplanted by a concept of national responsibility.
As evidence to support that view, consider the following illustrative instances.
Can thermonuclear war be set off by accident?
What steps have been taken to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continents?
Are we as safe as we should be from such a disaster?
Is anything being done to increase our margin of safety?
Will the danger increase or decrease?
I have just asked these questions in the Pentagon, in the White House, in offices of key scientists across the country and aboard the submarines that prowl for months underwater, with neat rows of green launch tubes which contain Polaris missiles and which are affectionately known as Sherwood Forest.
I asked the same questions inside the launch-control rooms of an Atlas missile base in Wyoming, where officers who wear sidearms are manning the commit buttons that could start a war -- accidentally or by design -- and in the command centers where other pistol-packing men could give orders to push such buttons.
To the men in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpits, submarine compartments and the antiseptic, windowless rooms that would be the foxholes of tomorrow's impersonal intercontinental wars, the questions seem farfetched.
There is unceasing pressure, but its sources are immediate.
Readiness exercises are almost continuous.
Each could be the real thing.
In the command centers there are special clocks ready to tick off the minutes elapsed since *j hour.
E stands for execution -- the moment a go order would unleash an American nuclear strike.
There is little time for the men in the command centers to reflect about the implications of these clocks.
They are preoccupied riding herd on control panels, switches, flashing colored lights on pale green or gray consoles that look like business machines.
They know little about their machinery beyond mechanical details.
Accidental war is so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involved in one are told just enough so they can perform their portions of incredibly complex tasks.
Among the policy makers, generals, physicists, psychologists and others charged with controlling the actions of the button pushers and their hardware, the answers to my questions varied partly according to a man's flair for what the professionals in this field call scenarios.
As an Air Force psychiatrist put it : you can't have dry runs on this one.
The experts are thus forced to hypothesize sequences of events that have never occurred, probably never will -- but possibly might.
Only one rule prevailed in my conversations with these men : the more highly placed they are -- that is, the more they know -- the more concerned they have become.
Already accidental war is a silent guest at the discussions within the Kennedy Administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other questions of national security.
Only recently new holes were discovered in our safety measures, and a search is now on for more.
Work is under way to see whether new restraining devices should be installed on all nuclear weapons.
Meanwhile, the experts speak of wars triggered by false pre-emption, escalation, unauthorized behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report.
They inhabit a secret world centered on go codes and gold phones.
Their conversations were, almost invariably, accompanied by the same gestures -- arms and pointed forefingers darting toward each other in arclike semicircular motions.
One arm represented our bombers and missiles, the other arm theirs.
Yet implicit in each movement was the death of millions, perhaps hundreds of millions, perhaps you and me -- and the experts.
These men are not callous.
It is their job to think about the unthinkable.
Unanimously they believe that the world would become a safer place if more of us -- and more Russians and Communist Chinese, too -- thought about accidental war.
The first systematic thinking about this Pandora's box within Pandora's boxes was done four years ago by Fred Ikle, a frail, meek-mannered Swiss-born sociologist.
He was, and is, with the *j Corporation, a nonprofit pool of thinkers financed by the U.*s. Air Force.
His investigations made him the Paul Revere of accidental war, and safety procedures were enormously increased.
In recent weeks, as a result of a sweeping defense policy reappraisal by the Kennedy Administration, basic United States strategy has been modified -- and large new sums allocated -- to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it as quickly as possible.
The chain starts at *j ( Ballistic Missile Early Warning System ) in Thule, Greenland.
Its radar screens would register Soviet missiles shortly after they are launched against the United States.
B*m*e*w*s intelligence is simultaneously flashed to *j ( North American Air Defense Command ) in Colorado Springs, Colorado, for interpretation ; to the *j command and control post, forty-five feet below the ground at Offutt Air Force Base, near Omaha, Nebraska ; to the Joint War Room of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon and to the President.
Telephones, Teletypes, several kinds of radio systems and, in some cases, television, link all vital points.
Alternate locations exist for all key command centers.
For last-ditch emergencies *j has alternate command posts on *j jet tankers.
Multiple circuits, routings and frequencies make the chain as unbreakable as possible.
The same principle of redundancy applies to all communications on these special networks.
And no messages can be transmitted on these circuits until senders and receivers authenticate in advance, by special codes, that the messages actually come from their purported sources.
Additional codes can be used to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications.
Only the President is permitted to authorize the use of nuclear weapons.
That's the law.
But what if somebody decides to break it?
The President cannot personally remove the safety devices from every nuclear trigger.
He makes the momentous decision.
Hundreds of men are required to pass the word to the button pushers and to push the buttons.
What if one or more of them turn irrational or suddenly, coolly, decide to clobber the Russians?
What if the President himself, in the language of the military, goes ape?
Or singlehandedly decided to reverse national policy and hit the Soviets without provocation?
Nobody can be absolutely certain of the answers.
However, the system is designed, ingeniously and hopefully, so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war.
Even the President cannot pick up his telephone and give a go order.
Even he does not know the one signal for a nuclear strike -- the go code.
In an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the gold-phone circuit.
A system of gold -- actually yellow -- phones connects him with the offices and action stations of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the *j commander and other key men.
All can be connected with the gold circuit from their homes.
All could help the President make his decision.
The talk would not be in code, but neither would it ramble.
Vital questions would be quickly answered according to a preprepared agenda.
Officers who participate in the continual practice drills assured me that the President's decision could be made and announced on the gold circuit within minutes after the first flash from *j.
If communications work, his decision would be instantly known in all command posts that would originate the actual go order.
For these centers, too, are on the gold circuit.
They include the Navy's Atlantic Command at Norfolk, Virginia, which is in contact with the Polaris subs ; *j headquarters in Europe ; Air Force forward headquarters in Europe and in the Pacific, which control tactical fighters on ships and land bases ; and *j, which controls long-range bombers and Atlas missiles.
Let us look in on one of these nerve centers -- *j at Omaha -- and see what must still happen before a wing of *j bombers could drop their *j.
In a word, plenty.
The key man almost certainly would be Col. William W. Wisman, *j senior controller.
He or his deputy or one of their seven assistants, all full colonels, mans the heart of the command post twenty-four hours a day.
It is a quiet but impressive room -- 140 feet long, thirty-nine feet wide, twenty-one feet high.
Movable panels of floor-to-ceiling maps and charts are crammed with intelligence information.
And Bill Wisman, forty-three, a farmer's son from Beallsville, Ohio, is a quiet but impressive man.
His eyes are steady anchors of the deepest brown.
His movements and speech are precise, clear and quick.
No question ruffles him or causes him to hesitate.
Wisman, who has had the chief controller's job for four years, calls the signals for a team operating three rows of dull-gray consoles studded with lights, switches and buttons.
At least a dozen men, some armed, are never far away from him.
In front of him is a gold phone.
In emergencies the *j commander, Gen. Thomas Power, or his deputies and their staff would occupy a balcony that stretches across the length of the room above Wisman and his staff.
At General Power's seat in the balcony there is also a gold phone.
General Power would participate in the decision making.
Wisman, below, would listen in and act.
His consoles can give him instant contact with more than seventy bases around the world and with every *j aircraft.
He need only pick up one of the two red telephone receivers at his extreme left, right next to the big red button marked alert.
( there are two receivers in case one should be dropped and damaged.
) but Wisman, too, does not know the go code.
He must take it from the red box.
In point of fact, this is a beige box with a bright red door, about one and a half feet square and hung from the wall about six feet from the door to Wisman's right.
The box is internally wired so the door can never be opened without setting off a screeching klaxon ( it's real obnoxious ).
Now we must become vague, for we are approaching one of the nation's most guarded secrets.
The codes in the red box -- there are several of them covering various contingencies -- are contained in a sealed *j unique device.
They are supplied, a batch at a time, by a secret source and are continually changed by Wisman or his staff, at random intervals.
But even the contents of Wisman's box cannot start a war.
They are mere fragments, just one portion of preprepared messages.
What these fragments are and how they activate the go order may not be revealed.
The pieces must be placed in the context of the prepared messages by Wisman's staff.
In addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedures which precede and follow the sending of the go messages, again in special codes, each message also contains an internal authenticator, another specific signal to convince the recipient that he is getting the real thing.
I asked Wisman what would happen if he broke out the go codes and tried to start transmitting one.
I'd wind up full of.38
Bullet holes, he said, and there was no question that he was talking about bullets fired by his coworkers.
Now let us imagine a wing of *j, on alert near their positive control ( or fail-safe ) points, the spots on the map, many miles from Soviet territory, beyond which they are forbidden to fly without specific orders to proceed to their targets.
They, too, have fragments of the go code with them.
As Wisman put it, they have separate pieces of the pie, and we have the whole pie.
Once we send out the whole pie, they can put their pieces into it.
Unless we send out the whole pie, their pieces mean nothing.
Why does Wisman's ever-changing code always mesh with the fragments in possession of the button pushers?
The answer is a cryptographic secret.
At any rate, three men out of a six-man *j crew are required to copy down Wisman's go-to-war message.
Each must match Wisman's pie with the fragment that he carries with him.
All three must compare notes and agree to go.
After that, it requires several minutes of concentrated work, including six separate and deliberate actions by a minimum of three men sitting at three separate stations in a bomber, each with another man beside him to help, for an armed bomb to be released.
Unless all gadgets are properly operated -- and the wires and seals from the handles removed first -- no damage can be done.
Suddenly, however, their posture changed and the game ended.
They went as rigid as black statuary six figures, lean and tall and angular, went still.
Their heads were in the air sniffing.
They all swung at the same instant in the same direction.
They saw it before I did, even with my binoculars.
It was nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall, a dull gray sheet which reached from a layer of clouds to the earth.
In the 360 degrees of horizon it obscured only a degree, no more.
A white man would not have seen it.
The aborigines fastened upon it with a concentration beyond pathos.
Watching, they waited until the squall thickened and began to move in a long drifting slant across the dry burning land.
At once the whole band set off at a lope.
They were chasing a rain cloud.
They went after the squall as mercilessly as a wolf pack after an abandoned cow.
I followed them in the jeep and now they did not care.
The games were over, this was life.
Occasionally, for no reason that I could see, they would suddenly alter the angle of their trot.
Sometimes I guessed it was because the rain squall had changed direction.
Sometimes it was to skirt a gulley.
Their gait is impossible to convey in words.
It has nothing of the proud stride of the trained runner about it, it is not a lope, it is not done with style or verve.
It is the gait of the human who must run to live : arms dangling, legs barely swinging over the ground, head hung down and only occasionally swinging up to see the target, a loose motion that is just short of stumbling and yet is wonderfully graceful.
It is a barely controlled skimming of the ground.
They ran for three hours.
Finally, avoiding hummocks and seeking low ground, they intercepted the rain squall.
For ten minutes they ran beneath the squall, raising their arms and, for the first time, shouting and capering.
Then the wind died and the rain squall held steady.
They were studying the ground.
Suddenly one of them shouted, ran a few feet, bent forward and put his mouth to the ground.
He had found a depression with rain water in it.
He bent down, a black cranelike figure, and put his mouth to the ground.
With a lordly and generous gesture, the discoverer stood up and beckoned to the closest of his fellows.
The other trotted over and swooped at the tiny puddle.
In an instant he had sucked it dry.
The aborigine lives on the cruelest land I have ever seen.
Which does not mean that it is ugly.
Part of it is, of course.
There are thousands of square miles of salt pan which are hideous.
They are huge areas which have been swept by winds for so many centuries that there is no soil left, but only deep bare ridges fifty or sixty yards apart with ravines between them thirty or forty feet deep and the only thing that moves is a scuttling layer of sand.
Such stretches have an inhuman moonlike quality.
But much of the land which the aborigine wanders looks as if it should be hospitable.
It is softened by the saltbush and the bluebush, has a peaceful quality, the hills roll softly.
The malignancy of such a landscape has been beautifully described by the Australian Charles Bean.
He tells of three men who started out on a trip across a single paddock, a ten-by-ten-mile square owned by a sheep grazer.
They went well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the outback country.
The countryside looked like a beautiful open park with gentle slopes and soft gray tree-clumps.
Nothing appalling or horrible rushed upon these men.
Only there happened -- nothing.
There might have been a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps : only -- there was not.
It might have rained, any time ; only -- it did not.
There might have been a fence or a house just over the next rise ; only -- there was not.
They lay, with the birds hopping from branch to branch above them and the bright sky peeping down at them.
No one came.
The white men died.
And countless others like them have died.
Even today range riders will come upon mummified bodies of men who attempted nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lost direction, were tortured by the heat, driven mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape, and who finally died.
The aborigine is not deceived ; he knows that the land is hard and pitiless.
He knows that the economy of life in the outback is awful.
There is no room for error or waste.
Any organism that falters or misperceives the signals or weakens is done.
I do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge, but I suspect that it can.
Perhaps this is what gives the aborigine his odd air of dignity.
The family at the boulder seeing an aborigine today is a difficult thing.
Many of them have drifted into the cities and towns and seaports.
Others are confined to vast reservations, and not only does the Australian government justifiably not wish them to be viewed as exhibits in a zoo, but on their reservations they are extremely fugitive, shunning camps, coming together only for corroborees at which their strange culture comes to its highest pitch -- which is very low indeed.
I persuaded an Australian friend who had lived outback for years to take me to see some aborigines living in the bush.
It was a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation, even though the rancher was said to be expert in his knowledge of the aborigines and their language.
Finally, however, the arrangements were made and we drove out into the bush in a Land Rover.
We followed the asphalt road for a few miles and then swung off onto a smaller road which was nothing more than two tire marks on the earth.
The rancher went a mile down this road and then, when he reached a big red boulder, swung off the road.
At once he started to glance toward the instrument panel.
It took me a moment to realize what was odd about that panel : there was a gimbaled compass welded to it, which rocked gently back and forth as the Land Rover bounced about.
The rancher was navigating his way across the flatland.
Do you always navigate like this?
I asked.
Damned right, he said.
Once I get out on the flat I do.
Some chaps that know an area well can make their way by landmarks, a tree here, a wash here, a boulder there.
But if you don't know the place like the palm of your hand, you'd better use a compass and the speedometer.
Two miles northeast, then five miles southwest that sort of thing.
Very simple.
He was right.
The landscape kept repeating itself.
I would try to memorize landmarks and saw in a half-hour that it was hopeless.
Finally we approached the bivouac of the aborigines.
They were camped beside a large column-shaped boulder : a man, his lubra, and two children.
The sun was not yet high and all of them were in the small area of shade cast by the boulder.
There was also a dog, a dingo dog.
Its ribs showed, it was a yellow nondescript color, it suffered from a variety of sores, hair had scabbed off its body in patches.
It lay with its head on its paws and only its eyes moving, watching us carefully.
It struck me as a very bright and very malnourished dog.
No one patted the dog.
It was not a pet.
It was a worker.
The buggers love shade, the rancher said.
I suppose because it saves them some loss of body water.
They'll move around that rock all day, following the shade.
During the hottest part of the day, of course, the sun comes straight down and there isn't any shade.
We drove close to the boulder, stopped the Land Rover, and walked over toward the family.
The man was leaning against the rock.
He gazed away from us as we approached.
He was over six feet tall and very thin.
His legs were narrow and very long.
Every bone and muscle in his body showed, but he did not give the appearance of starving.
He had long black hair and a wispy beard.
The ridges over his eyes were huge and his eyelids were half shut.
There was something about his face that disturbed me and it took several seconds to realize what.
It was not merely that flies were crawling over his face but his narrowed eyelids did not blink when the flies crawled into his eye sockets.
A fly would crawl down the bulging forehead, into the socket of the eye, walk along the man's lashes and across the wet surface of the eyeball, and the eye did not blink.
The Australian and I both were wearing insect repellent and were not badly bothered by insects, but my eyes watered as we stood watching the aborigine.
I turned to look at the lubra.
She remained squatting on her heels all the time we were there ; like the man, she was entirely naked.
Her long thin arms moved in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possessions which were placed in front of her.
There were two rubbing sticks for making fire, two stones shaped roughly like knives, a woven-root container which held a few pounds of dried worms and the dead body of some rodent.
There was also a long wooden spear and a woomera, a spear-throwing device which gives the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy.
There was also a boomerang, elaborately carved.
Everything was burnished with sweat and grease so that all of the objects seemed to have been carved from the same material and to be ageless.
The two children, both boys, wandered around the Australian and me for a few moments and then returned to their work.
They squatted on their heels with their heads bent far forward, their eyes only a few inches from the ground.
They had located the runway of a colony of ants and as the ants came out of the ground, the boys picked them up, one at a time, and pinched them dead.
The tiny bodies, dropped onto a dry leaf, made a pile as big as a small apple.
The odor here was more powerful than that which surrounded the town aborigines.
The smell at first was more surprising than unpleasant.
It was also subtly familiar, for it was the odor of the human body, but multiplied innumerable times because of the fact that the aborigines never bathed.
One's impulse is to say that the smell was a stink and unpleasant.
But that is a cliche and a dishonest one.
The smell is sexual, but so powerfully so that a civilized nose must deny it.
Their skin was covered with a thin coating of sweat and dirt which had almost the consistency of a second skin.
They roll at night in ashes to keep warm and their second skin has a light dusty cast to it.
In spots such as the elbows and knees the second skin is worn off and I realized the aborigines were much darker than they appeared ; as if the coating of sweat, dirt, and ashes were a cosmetic.
The boys had beautiful dark eyes and unlike their father they brushed constantly at the flies and blinked their eyes.
That smell is something, eh, mate?
The Australian asked.
They swear that every person smells different and every family smells different from every other.
At the corroborees, when they get to dancing and sweating, you'll see them rubbing up against a man who's supposed to have a specially good smell.
Idje, here, and he nodded at the man, is said to have great odor.
The stink is all the same to me, but I really think they can make one another out blindfolded.
Here, Idje, you fella like tabac?
He said sharply.
Idje still stared over our shoulders at the horizon.
The Australian stopped trying to talk a pidgin I could understand, and spoke strange words from deep in his chest.
It was a fortunate time in which to build, for the seventeenth century was a great period in Persian art.
The architects, the tile and carpet makers, the potters, painters, calligraphers, and metalsmiths worked through Abbas's reign and those of his successors to enrich the city.
Travelers entering from the desert were confounded by what must have seemed an illusion : a great garden filled with nightingales and roses, cut by canals and terraced promenades, studded with water tanks of turquoise tile in which were reflected the glistening blue curves of a hundred domes.
At the heart of all of this was the square, which one such traveler declared to be as spacious, as pleasant and aromatick a Market as any in the Universe.
In time Isfahan came to be known as half the world, Isfahan nisf-i-jahan.
In the early eighteenth century this fantastic city, then the size of London, started to decline.
The Afghans invaded ; the Safavids fell from power ; the capital went elsewhere ; the desert encroached.
Isfahan became more of a legend than a place, and now it is for many people simply a name to which they attach their notions of old Persia and sometimes of the East.
They think of it as a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor.
Those who actually get there find that it isn't spooky at all but as brilliant as a tile in sunlight.
But even for them it remains a museum, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb, a tomb in which Persia lies well preserved but indeed dead.
Everyone is ready to grant the Persians their history, but almost no one is willing to acknowledge their present.
It seems that for Persia, and especially for this city, there are only two times : the glorious past and the corrupt, depressing, sterile present.
The one apparent connection between the two is a score of buildings which somehow or other have survived and which naturally enough are called historical monuments.
However, just as all the buildings have not fallen and flowed back to their original mud, so the values which wanted them and saw that they were built have not all disappeared.
The values and talents which made the tile and the dome, the rug, the poem and the miniature, continue in certain social institutions which rise above the ordinary life of this city, as the great buildings rise above blank walls and dirty lanes.
Often, too, the social institutions are housed in these pavilions and palaces and bridges, for these great structures are not simply historical monuments ; they are the places where Persians live.
The promenade, for example, continues to take place on the Chahar Bagh, a mile-long garden of plane and poplar trees that now serves as the city's principal street.
?
It takes place as well along the terraces and through the arcades of the Khaju bridge, and also in the gardens of the square.
On Fridays, the day when many Persians relax with poetry, talk, and a samovar, people do not, it is true, stream into Chehel Sotun -- a pavilion and garden built by Shah Abbas 2 in the seventeenth century -- but they do retire into hundreds of pavilions throughout the city and up the river valley, which are smaller, more humble copies of the former.
And of course religious life continues to center in the more famous mosques, and commercial life -- very much a social institution -- in the bazaar.
Those three other great activities of the Persians, the bath, the teahouse, and the zur khaneh ( the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of men in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics, dance, chanted poetry, and music ), do not take place in buildings to which entrance tickets are sold, but some of them occupy splendid examples of Persian domestic architecture : long, domed, chalk-white rooms with daises of turquoise tile, their end walls cut through to the orchards and the sky by open arches.
But more important, and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see, is that these places and activities are often the settings in which Persians exercise their extraordinary aesthetic sensibilities.
Water, air, fruit, poetry, music, the human form -- these things are important to Persians, and they experience them with an intense and discriminating awareness.
I should like, by the way, to make it clear that I am not using the word Persians carelessly.
I don't mean a few aesthetes who play about with sensations, like a young prince in a miniature dabbling his hand in a pool.
These things are important to almost all Persians and perhaps most important to the most ordinary.
The men crying love poems in an orchard on any summer's night are as often as not the lutihaw, mustachioed toughs who spend most of their lives in and out of the local prisons, brothels, and teahouses.
A few months ago it was a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lugged me up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for its clarity and flavor.
Not long ago an acquaintance, a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city, stood on the balcony puffing his first cigarette in weeks.
The air, he said, was just right ; a cigarette would taste particularly good.
I really didn't know what he meant.
It was a nice day, granted.
But he knew ; he sniffed the air and licked it on his lip and knew as a vintner knows a vintage.
The natural world then, plus poetry and some kinds of art, receives from the most ordinary of Persians a great deal of attention.
The line of an eyebrow, the color of the skin, a ghazal from Hafiz, the purity of spring water, the long afternoon among the boughs which crowd the upper story of a pavilion -- these things are noticed, judged, and valued.
Nowhere in Isfahan is this rich aesthetic life of the Persians shown so well as during the promenade at the Khaju bridge.
There has probably always been a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city.
For one thing, there is a natural belt of rock across the river bed ; for another, it was here that one of the old caravan routes came in.
It was to provide a safe and spacious crossing for these caravans, and also to make a pleasance for the city, that Shah Abbas 2 in about 1657 built, of sun-baked brick, tile, and stone, the present bridge.
It is a splendid structure.
From upstream it looks like a long arcaded box laid across the river ; from downstream, where the water level is much lower, it is a high, elaborately facaded pavilion.
The top story contains more than thirty alcoves separated from each other by spandrels of blue and yellow tile.
At either end and in the center there are bays which contain nine greater alcoves as frescoed and capacious as church apses.
Here, in the old days -- when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks -- sat the king and his court while priests, soldiers, and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between.
Below, twenty vaults tunnel through the understructure of the bridge.
These are traversed by another line of vaults, and thus rooms, arched on all four sides, are formed.
Down through the axis of the bridge there is a long diminishing vista like a visual echo of piers and arches, while the vaults fronting upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise, the mountains and river pools.
Here, on the hottest day, it is cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flowing in the sluices at the bottom of the vaults.
On the downstream, or pavilion, side these vaults give out onto terraces twice as wide as the bridge itself.
From the terraces -- eighteen in all -- broad flights of steps descend into the water or onto still more terraces barely above the level of the river.
Out of water, brick, and tile they have made far more than just a bridge.
On spring and summer evenings people leave their shops and houses and walk up through the lanes of the city to the bridge.
It is a great spectacle.
The bridge itself rises up from the river, light-flared and enormous, like the outdoor set for an epic opera.
Crowds press along the terraces, down the steps, in and out of the arcades, massing against it as though it were a fortress under siege.
All kinds come to walk in the promenade : merchants from the bazaar bickering over a deal ; a Bakhtiari khan in a cap and hacking jacket ; dervishes who stand with the stillness of the blind, their eyes filmed with rheum and visions ; the old Kajar princes arriving in their ancient limousines ; students, civil servants, beggars, musicians, hawkers, and clowns.
Families go out to the edge of the terraces to sit on carpets around a samovar.
Below, people line the steps, as though on bleachers, to watch the sky and river.
Above, in the tiled prosceniums of the alcoves, boys sing the ghazals of Hafiz and Saadi, while at the very bottom, in the vaults, the toughs and blades of the city hoot and bang their drums, drink arak, play dice, and dance.
Here in an evening Persians enjoy many of the things which are important to them : poetry, water, the moon, a beautiful face.
To a stranger their delight in these things may seem paradoxical, for Persians chase the golden calf as much as any people.
Many of them, moreover, are beginning to complain about the scarcity of Western amusements and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant, the mullah, and the peasant.
Nonetheless, they take time out -- much time -- from the game of grab and these new Western experiments to go to the gardens and riverbanks.
Above all, they will stop in the middle of anything, anywhere, to hear or quote some poetry.
Poetry in Persian life is far more than a common ground on which -- in a society deeply fissured by antagonisms -- all may stand.
It contains, in fact, their whole outlook on life.
And it is expressed, at least to their taste, in a perfect form.
Poetry for a Persian is nothing less than truth and beauty.
In most Western cultures today these twins have been sent away to the libraries and museums.
In Persia, where practically speaking there are no museums or libraries or, for that matter, hardly any books, the twins run free.
It is perhaps difficult to conceive, but imagine that tonight on London bridge the Teddy boys of the East End will gather to sing Marlowe, Herrick, Shakespeare, and perhaps some lyrics of their own.
That, at any rate, is what happens at the Khaju bridge.
Boys and men go along the riverbank or to the alcoves in the top arcade.
Here in these little rooms -- or stages arched open to the sky and river -- they choose a few lines out of the hundreds they may know and sing them according to one of the modes into which Persian music is divided.
Each mode is believed to have a specific attribute -- one inducing pleasure, another generosity, another love, and so on, to include all of the emotions.
The singer simply matches the poem to a mode ; for example, the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem : they brought me news that Spring is in the plains and Ahmad's blood the crimson tulip stains ; go, tell his aged mother that her son Fought with a thousand foes, and he was one.
Or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet : know ye, fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth, that here, with dust upon his eyes, Iraj, the sweet-tongued singer, lies.
In this true lover's tomb interred a world of love lies sepulchred.
These songs ( practically all Persian music, for that matter ) are limited to a range of two octaves.
Yet within this limitation there is an astonishing variety : design as intricate as that in the carpet or miniature, with the melodic line like the painted or woven line often flowing into an arabesque.
Die Frist ist um, und wiederum verstrichen sind sieben Jahr, the Maestro quoted The Flying Dutchman, as he told of his career and wanderings, explaining that the number seven had significantly recurred in his life several times.
The music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, William Steinberg, has molded his group into a prominent musical organization, which is his life.
When he added to his Pittsburgh commitments the directorship of the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1958, he conducted one hundred fifty concerts within nine months, commuting between the two cities.
This schedule became too strenuous, even for the energetic and conscientious Mr. Steinberg.
His London contract was rescinded, and now, he explains cheerfully, as a bright smile lightens his intense, mobile face, I conduct only one hundred and twenty concerts ] our meeting took place in May, 1961, during one of the Maestro's stop-overs in New York, before he left for Europe.
As we began to converse in the lounge of his Fifth Avenue hotel, his restlessness and sensitivity to light and sound became immediately apparent.
Seeking an obscure, dark, relatively quiet corner in the airy room otherwise suffused with afternoon sunshine, he asked if the soft background music could be turned off.
Unfortunately, it was Muzak, which automatically is piped into the public rooms, and which nolens volens had to be endured.
As he talked about himself, time and again stuffing and dragging on his pipe, Steinberg began to relax and the initial hurried feeling grew faint and was dispelled.
Did he come from a musical family?
Yes : though not professional musicians, they were a music-loving family.
In his native Cologne, where his mother taught him to play the piano, he was able to read notes before he learned the alphabet.
She even devised a system of colors, whereby the boy could easily distinguish the different note values.
When he started school at the age of five-and-a-half, he could not understand why the alphabet begins with the letter A, instead of C, as in the scale.
Because, like many other children, he intensely disliked practicing Czerny Etudes, he composed his own studies.
When he was eight he began violin lessons.
Soon he was playing in the Cologne Municipal Orchestra, and during World War 1, when musicians were scarce, he joined the opera orchestra as well.
Steinberg claims that these early years of orchestra participation were of invaluable help to his career.
By observing the conductor, he says with a twinkle in his eyes, I learned how not to conduct.
The musician ran away from school when he was fifteen, but this escapade did not save him from the Gymnasium.
Simultaneously, he pursued his musical studies at the conservatory, receiving sound training in counterpoint and harmony, as well in the violin and piano.
His professional career began when he was twenty ; he became Otto Klemperer's personal assistant at the Cologne Opera, and a year later was promoted to the position of regular conductor.
Wasn't this an unusually young age to fill such a responsible post?
Yes, the Maestro assented.
Had he always wished to be a conductor?
No, originally he had hoped to become a concert pianist and had even performed as such.
However, when he assumed the duties of a conductor, he relinquished his career as a pianist.
Five years were spent with the Cologne Opera, after which he was called to Prague by Alexander von Zemlinsky, teacher of Arnold Schonberg and Erich Korngold.
In 1927 he succeeded Zemlinsky as opera director of the German Theater at Prague.
During his tenure he also fulfilled guest engagements at the Berlin State Opera.
Two years later he became director of the Frankfurt Opera, where he remained until he lost this position in 1933 through the rise of the Hitler regime.
During these years the youthful conductor had contributed greatly to the high level of musical life in Germany.
He had presented the first German performances of Puccini's Manon Lescaut and De Falla's La Vida Breve.
The Frankfurt years were particularly noteworthy for his performance of Berg's Wozzek soon after the Berlin premiere under Erich Kleiber, and the world premiere of Schonberg's Von heute auf morgen.
At the outset of his career, Steinberg had dedicated himself to the advancement of contemporary music by vowing to do a Schonberg work every year.
In Frankfurt, too, he directed the Museum and Opera House concerts which, in addition to the standard repertoire, featured novelties like Erdmann's Piano Concerto and Mahler's Sixth Symphony.
Because of the political upheaval in Germany in the 1930's, Steinberg was forced to restrict his activities to the Jewish community.
Through the Frankfurt Jewish Kulturbund he began to give sonata recitals in synagogues, with Cellist Emanuel Feuermann.
As more and more Jewish musicians lost their jobs with professional organizations Steinberg united them into the Frankfurt Kulturbund Orchestra, which also gave guest performances in other German cities.
In 1936 he accepted the leadership of the Berlin Kulturbund.
In the fall of that year the best musicians of the Berlin and Frankfurt Kulturbund orchestras joined under the combined efforts of Bronislaw Hubermann and Steinberg to become the Palestine Orchestra -- now known as the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra -- with Steinberg as founder-conductor.
In 1938, at the insistence of Arturo Toscanini, Steinberg left Germany for the United States, by way of Switzerland.
After he had spent the first three years in New York as associate conductor, at Toscanini's invitation, of the *j Orchestra, he made numerous guest appearances throughout the United States and Latin America.
In 1945 he became conductor of the Buffalo Philharmonic.
Seven years later he was asked to become director of the Pittsburgh Symphony.
Since 1944 he has also conducted regularly at the San Francisco Opera, where he made his debut with a memorable performance of Verdi's Falstaff.
In recent years he has traveled widely in Europe, conducting in Italy, France, Austria, and Switzerland.
He returned to Germany for the first time in 1953, where he has since conducted in Cologne, Frankfurt, and Berlin.
Where in Europe was he going now?
First of all, to Italy for a short vacation -- Forte Dei Marmi, a place he loves.
Since it is not far from Viareggio, he will visit Puccini's house, as he never fails to do, to pay his respects to the memory of the composer of La Boheme, which he considers one of Puccini's masterpieces.
Steinberg spoke with warmth and enthusiasm about Italy : Rome is my second home.
I consider it the center of the world and make it a point to be there once a year.
He will conduct two concerts at the Accademia Di Santa Cecilia, as well as concerts in Munich and Cologne.
Then I return to the United States for engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and in Philadelphia, he added.
The forthcoming season in Pittsburgh also promises to be of unusual interest.
There will be premieres of new works, made possible through Ford Foundation commissions : Carlisle Floyd's Mystery, with Phyllis Curtin as soprano soloist.
Other world premieres will be Gardner Read's Third Symphony and Burle Marx's Samba Concertante.
And next year we will do -- also a Ford commission -- a piano concerto by Elliott Carter, with Jacob Lateiner as soloist.
Of course, I shall conduct Mahler and Bruckner works in the coming season, as usual.
We'll play Bruckner's Fifth Symphony in the original version, and Mahler's Seventh -- the least accessible, known, and played of Mahler's works.
My Pittsburghers have become real addicts to Mahler and Bruckner.
He added that he also stresses the works of these favorite masters on tour, especially Mahler's First and Fourth symphonies, and Das Lied Von der Erde, and Bruckner's Sixth -- which is rarely played -- and Seventh.
Bruckner's Eighth he refers to as my travel symphony.
He recalled that in California after a critic had attacked him for still trying to sell Bruckner to the Americans, the public's response at the next concert was a standing ovation.
Now that Bruno Walter is virtually in retirement and my dear friend Dimitri Mitropoulos is no longer with us, I am probably the only one -- with the possible exception of Leonard Bernstein -- who has this special affinity for and champions the works of Bruckner and Mahler.
Since he introduces so much modern music, I could not resist asking how he felt about it.
There was always and at all times a contemporary music and it expresses the era in which it was created.
But I usually stick to the old phrase : ich habe ein Amt, aber keine Meinung ( I hold an office, but I do not feel entitled to have an opinion ).
I consider it to be my job to expose the public to what is being written today.
With all his musical activities, did he have the time and inclination to do anything else?
He had just paid a brief visit to the Frick Collection to admire his favorite paintings by Rembrandt and Franz Hals.
He was not enthusiastic over the newly acquired Claude Lorrain, but reminisced with pleasure over a Poussin exhibit he had been able to see in Paris a year ago.
And how did he feel about modern art?
Again Steinberg was cautious and replied with a smile that he was not exposed to it enough to hazard comments.
As my wife puts it, he said, again with a twinkle in his eyes, all you know is your music.
But after all, you never learned anything else ] what did he do for relaxation?
Like his late colleague, Mitropoulos, he reads mystery stories, in particular Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
He cited Heine and Stendhal as favorites in literature.
But his prime interest, apart from music, he insisted seriously, was his family -- his wife, daughter and son.
At the moment he was excited about his son's having received the Prix De Rome in archaeology and was looking forward to being present this summer at the excavation of an Etruscan tomb.
Both children are musical and my wife is a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement.
Is the attitude of German youth comparable to that of the angry young men of England?
Was the topic for a round-table discussion at the Bayerische Rundfunk in Munich.
I was chairman, the only not youthful participant.
Since attack serves to stimulate interest in broadcasts, I added to my opening statement a sentence in which I claimed that German youth seemed to lack the enthusiasm which is a necessary ingredient of anger, and might be classified as uninterested and bored rather than angry.
I was far from convinced of the truth of my statement, but could not think of anything that might evoke responses more quickly.
It is easy for you to talk ; countered a twenty year old law student, you travel around the world.
We would like to do that too.
But you want a job guaranteed when you return, I continued my attack.
You must have some security, said a young clerk.
When I mentioned that for my first long voyage I did not even have the money for the return fare, but had trusted to luck that I would earn a sufficient amount, the young people looked at me doubtingly.
One girl expressed what was obviously in their minds.
Would you advise us to act the same way?
You might have failed.
I think it is rather foolhardy to trust to luck.
Others mentioned that I might have had to ask friends or even strangers for help and that to be stranded in a foreign country without sufficient funds did not contribute to international understanding.
The debate needed no additional controversy and soon I could ask each individually what he expected from life, what his hopes were and what his fears.
Though the four boys and two girls, the youngest nineteen years of age, the oldest twenty-four, came from varying backgrounds and had different professional and personal interests, there was surprising agreement among them.
What they wished for most was security ; what they feared most was war or political instability in their own country.
The ideal home, they agreed, would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five rooms, just enough for a family consisting of husband, wife, and two children.
No one wanted a larger family or no children, and none hoped for a castle or said that living in less settled circumstances would be satisfactory.
All expressed interest in world affairs but no one offered to make any sacrifices to satisfy this interest.
Once again, as in the days of the Founding Fathers, America faces a stern test.
That test, as President Kennedy forthrightly depicted it in his State of the Union message, will determine whether a nation organized and governed such as ours can endure.
It is well then that in this hour both of national peril and of national opportunity we can take counsel with the men who made the nation.
Incapable of self-delusion, the Founding Fathers found the crisis of their time to be equally grave, and yet they had confidence that America would surmount it and that a republic of free peoples would prosper and serve as an example to a world aching for liberty.
Seven Founders -- George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay -- determined the destinies of the new nation.
In certain respects, their task was incomparably greater than ours today, for there was nobody before them to show them the way.
As Madison commented to Jefferson in 1789, we are in a wilderness without a single footstep to guide us.
Our successors will have an easier task.
They thought of themselves, to use Jefferson's words, as the Argonauts who had lived in the Heroic Age.
Accordingly, they took special pains to preserve their papers as essential sources for posterity.
Their writings assume more than dramatic or patriotic interest because of their conviction that the struggle in which they were involved was neither selfish nor parochial but, rather, as Washington in his last wartime circular reminded his fellow countrymen, that with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be involved.
Strong men with strong opinions, frank to the point of being refreshingly indiscreet, the Founding Seven were essentially congenial minds, and their agreements with each other were more consequential than their differences.
Even though in most cases the completion of the definitive editions of their writings is still years off, enough documentation has already been assembled to warrant drawing a new composite profile of the leadership which performed the heroic dual feats of winning American independence and founding a new nation.
Before merging them into a common profile it is well to remember that their separate careers were extraordinary.
Certainly no other seven American statesmen from any later period achieved so much in so concentrated a span of years.
Eldest of the seven, Benjamin Franklin, a New Englander transplanted to Philadelphia, wrote the most dazzling success story in our history.
The young printer's apprentice achieved greatness in a half-dozen different fields, as editor and publisher, scientist, inventor, philanthropist and statesman.
Author of the Albany Plan Of Union, which, had it been adopted, might have avoided the Revolution, he fought the colonists' front-line battles in London, negotiated the treaty of alliance with France and the peace that ended the war, headed the state government of Pennsylvania, and exercised an important moderating influence at the Federal Convention.
On a military mission for his native Virginia the youthful George Washington touched off the French and Indian War, then guarded his colony's frontier as head of its militia.
Commanding the Continental Army for six long years of the Revolution, he was the indispensable factor in the ultimate victory.
Retiring to his beloved Mount Vernon, he returned to preside over the Federal Convention, and was the only man in history to be unanimously elected President.
During his two terms the Constitution was tested and found workable, strong national policies were inaugurated, and the traditions and powers of the Presidential office firmly fixed.
John Adams fashioned much of pre-*revolutionary radical ideology, wrote the constitution of his home state of Massachusetts, negotiated, with Franklin and Jay, the peace with Britain and served as our first Vice President and our second President.
His political opponent and lifetime friend, Thomas Jefferson, achieved immortality through his authorship of the Declaration of Independence, but equally notable were the legal and constitutional reforms he instituted in his native Virginia, his role as father of our territorial system, and his acquisition of the Louisiana Territory during his first term as President.
During the greater part of Jefferson's career he enjoyed the close collaboration of a fellow Virginian, James Madison, eight years his junior.
The active sponsor of Jefferson's measure for religious liberty in Virginia, Madison played the most influential single role in the drafting of the Constitution and in securing its ratification in Virginia, founded the first political party in American history, and, as Jefferson's Secretary of State and his successor in the Presidency, guided the nation through the troubled years of our second war with Britain.
If Franklin was an authentic genius, then Alexander Hamilton, with his exceptional precocity, consuming energy, and high ambition, was a political prodigy.
His revolutionary pamphlets, published when he was only 19, quickly brought him to the attention of the patriot leaders.
Principal author of The Federalist, he swung New York over from opposition to the Constitution to ratification almost single-handedly.
His collaboration with Washington, begun when he was the general's aide during the Revolution, was resumed when he entered the first Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury.
His bold fiscal program and his broad interpretation of the Constitution stand as durable contributions.
Less dazzling than Hamilton, less eloquent than Jefferson, John Jay commands an equally high rank among the Founding Fathers.
He served as president of the Continental Congress.
He played the leading role in negotiating the treaty with Great Britain that ended the Revolution, and directed America's foreign affairs throughout the Confederation period.
As first Chief Justice, his strong nationalist opinions anticipated John Marshall.
He ended his public career as a two-term governor of New York.
These Seven Founders constituted an intellectual and social elite, the most respectable and disinterested leadership any revolution ever confessed.
Their social status was achieved in some cases by birth, as with Washington, Jefferson and Jay ; in others by business and professional acumen, as with Franklin and Adams, or, in Hamilton's case, by an influential marriage.
Unlike so many of the power-starved intellectuals in underdeveloped nations of our own day, they commanded both prestige and influence before the Revolution started.
As different physically as the tall, angular Jefferson was from the chubby, rotund Adams, the seven were striking individualists.
Ardent, opinionated, even obstinate, they were amazingly articulate, wrote their own copy, and were masters of phrasemaking.
Capable of enduring friendships, they were also stout controversialists, who could write with a drop of vitriol on their pens.
John Adams dismissed John Dickinson, who voted against the Declaration of Independence, as a certain great fortune and piddling genius.
Washington castigated his critic, General Conway, as being capable of all the meanness of intrigue to gratify the absurd resentment of disappointed vanity.
And Hamilton, who felt it a religious duty to oppose Aaron Burr's political ambitions, would have been a better actuarial risk had he shown more literary restraint.
The Seven Founders were completely dedicated to the public service.
Madison once remarked : my life has been so much a public one, a comment which fits the careers of the other six.
Franklin retired from editing and publishing at the age of 42, and for the next forty-two years devoted himself to public, scientific, and philanthropic interests.
Washington never had a chance to work for an extended stretch at the occupation he loved best, plantation management.
He served as Commander in Chief during the Revolution without compensation.
John Adams took to heart the advice given him by his legal mentor, Jeremiah Gridley, to pursue the study of the law, rather than the gain of it.
In taking account of seventeen years of law practice, Adams concluded that no lawyer in America ever did so much business as I did and for so little profit.
When the Revolution broke out, he, along with Jefferson and Jay, abandoned his career at the bar, with considerable financial sacrifice.
Hamilton, poorest of the seven, gave up a brilliant law practice to enter Washington's Cabinet.
While he was handling the multi-million-dollar funding operations of the Government he had to resort to borrowing small sums from friends.
If you can conveniently let me have twenty dollars, he wrote one friend in 1791 when he was Secretary of the Treasury.
To support his large family Hamilton went back to the law after each spell of public service.
Talleyrand passed his New York law office one night on the way to a party.
Hamilton was bent over his desk, drafting a legal paper by the light of a candle.
The Frenchman was astonished.
I have just come from viewing a man who had made the fortune of his country, but now is working all night in order to support his family, he reflected.
All seven combined ardent devotion to the cause of revolution with a profound respect for legality.
John Adams asserted in the Continental Congress' Declaration of Rights that the demands of the colonies were in accordance with their charters, the British Constitution and the common law, and Jefferson appealed in the Declaration of Independence to the tribunal of the world for support of a revolution justified by the laws of nature and of nature's God.
They fought hard, but they were forgiving to former foes, and sought to prevent vindictive legislatures from confiscating Tory property in violation of the Treaty of 1783.
This sense of moderation and fairness is superbly exemplified in an exchange of letters between John Jay and a Tory refugee, Peter Van Schaack.
Jay had participated in the decision that exiled his old friend Van Schaack.
Yet when, at war's end, the ex-*tory made the first move to resume correspondence, Jay wrote him from Paris, where he was negotiating the peace settlement : as an independent American I considered all who were not for us, and you amongst the rest, as against us, yet be assured that John Jay never ceased to be the friend of Peter Van Schaack.
The latter in turn assured him that were I arraigned at the bar, and you my judge, I should expect to stand or fall only by the merits of my cause.
All seven recognized that independence was but the first step toward building a nation.
We have now a national character to establish, Washington wrote in 1783.
Think continentally, Hamilton counseled the young nation.
This new force, love of country, super-imposed upon -- if not displacing -- affectionate ties to one's own state, was epitomized by Washington.
His first inaugural address speaks of my country whose voice I can never hear but with veneration and love.
All sought the fruition of that nationalism in a Federal Government with substantial powers.
Save Jefferson, all participated in the framing or ratification of the Federal Constitution.
They supported it, not as a perfect instrument, but as the best obtainable.
Historians have traditionally regarded the great debates of the Seventeen Nineties as polarizing the issues of centralized vs. limited government, with Hamilton and the nationalists supporting the former and Jefferson and Madison upholding the latter position.
The state's rights position was formulated by Jefferson and Madison in the Kentucky and Virginia Resolves, but in their later careers as heads of state the two proved themselves better Hamiltonians than Jeffersonians.
In purchasing Louisiana, Jefferson had to adopt Hamilton's broad construction of the Constitution, and so did Madison in advocating the rechartering of Hamilton's bank, which he had so strenuously opposed at its inception, and in adopting a Hamiltonian protective tariff.
Indeed, the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton-oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats.
When, in 1832, the South Carolina nullifiers adopted the principle of state interposition which Madison had advanced in his old Virginia Resolve, they elicited no encouragement from that senior statesman.
In his political testament, Advice To My Country, penned just before his death, Madison expressed the wish that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.
Let the open enemy to it be regarded as a Pandora with her box opened ; and the disguised one, as the serpent creeping with his deadly wiles into Paradise.
Tobacco Road is dead.
Long live Tobacco Road.
Nostalgic Yankee readers of Erskine Caldwell are today informed by proud Georgians that Tobacco Road is buried beneath a four-lane super highway, over which travel each day suburbanite businessmen more concerned with the Dow-*jones average than with the cotton crop.
Thus we are compelled to face the urbanization of the South -- an urbanization which, despite its dramatic and overwhelming effects upon the Southern culture, has been utterly ignored by the bulk of Southern writers.
Indeed, it seems that only in today's Southern fiction does Tobacco Road, with all the traditional trimmings of sowbelly and cornbread and mint juleps, continue to live -- but only as a weary, overexploited phantom.
Those writers known collectively as the Southern school have received accolades from even those critics least prone to eulogize ; according to many critics, in fact, the South has led the North in literature since the Civil War, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
Such writers as William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren have led the field of somewhat less important writers in a sort of post-bellum renaissance.
It is interesting, however, that despite this strong upsurge in Southern writing, almost none of the writers has forsaken the firmly entrenched concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sipping a mint julep as he silently recounts the revenue from the season's cotton and tobacco crops ; of the stereotyped Negro servants chanting hymns as they plow the fields ; of these and a host of other antiquated legends that deny the South its progressive leaps of the past century.
This is not to say that the South is no longer agrarian ; such a statement would be the rankest form of oversimplification.
But the South is, and has been for the past century, engaged in a wide-sweeping urbanization which, oddly enough, is not reflected in its literature.
In 1900 the South was only 15% urban ; in 1950 it had become 47.1% urban.
In a mere half-century the South has more than tripled its urban status.
There is a New South emerging, a South losing the folksy traditions of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche -- especially within recent decades.
As the New South snowballs toward further urbanization, it becomes more and more homogeneous with the North -- a tendency which Willard Thorp terms Yankeefication, as evidenced in such cities as Charlotte, Birmingham, and Houston.
It is said that, even at the present stage of Southern urbanization, such a city as Atlanta is not distinctly unlike Columbus or Trenton.
Undoubtedly even the old Southern stalwart Richmond has felt the new wind : William Styron mentions in his latest novel an avenue named for Bankhead Mc*gruder, a Civil War general, now renamed, in typical California fashion, Buena Vista Terrace.
The effects of television and other mass media are erasing regional dialects and localisms with a startling force.
As for progress, the backward South can boast of Baton Rouge, which increased its population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent, to 126,000, the second largest growth of the period for all cities over 25,000.
The field, then, is ripe for new Southerners to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon, the Southern Yankeefication : the new urban economy, the city-dweller, the pains of transition, the labor problems ; the list is, obviously, endless.
But these sources have not been tapped.
Truman Capote is still reveling in Southern Gothicism, exaggerating the old Southern legends into something beautiful and grotesque, but as unreal as -- or even more unreal than -- yesterday.
William Styron, while facing the changing economy with a certain uneasy reluctance, insists he is not to be classified as a Southern writer and yet includes traditional Southern concepts in everything he publishes.
Even the great god Faulkner, the South's one probable contender for literary immortality, has little concerned himself with these matters ; such are simply not within his bounded province.
Where are the writers to treat these changes?
Has the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism is somehow dreaded or unwanted?
Perhaps present writers hypnotically cling to the older order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeated testings over the decades.
Lacking the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy, these writers seem to be contenting themselves with an old one that is now as defunct as Confederate money.
An example of the changes which have crept over the Southern region may be seen in the Southern Negro's quest for a position in the white-dominated society, a problem that has been reflected in regional fiction especially since 1865.
Today the Negro must discover his role in an industrialized South, which indicates that the racial aspect of the Southern dilemma hasn't changed radically, but rather has gradually come to be reflected in this new context, this new coat of paint.
The Negro faces as much, if not more, difficulty in fitting himself into an urban economy as he did in an agrarian one.
This represents a gradual change in an ever-present social problem.
But there have been abrupt changes as well : the sit-ins, the picket lines, the bus strikes -- all of these were unheard-of even ten years ago.
Today's evidence, such as the fact that only three Southern states ( South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi ) still openly defy integration, would have astounded many of yesterday's Southerners into speechlessness.
Other examples of gradual changes that have affected the Negro have been his moving up, row by row, in the buses ; his requesting, and often getting, higher wages, better working conditions, better schools -- changes that were slowly emerging even before the Supreme Court decision of 1954.
Then came this decision, which sped the process of gaining equality ( or perhaps hindered it ; only historical evolution will determine which ) : an abrupt change.
Since 1954 the Negro's desire for social justice has led to an ironically anarchical rebellion.
He has frequently refused to move from white lunch counters, refused to obey local laws which he considers unjust, while in other cases he has appealed to federal laws.
This bold self-assertion, after decades of humble subservience, is indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon, an abrupt change in the Southern way of existence.
A new order is thrusting itself into being.
A new South is emerging after the post-bellum years of hesitation, uncertainty, and lack of action from the Negro in defining his new role in the amorphously defined socio-political organizations of the white man.
The modern Negro has not made a decisive debut into Southern fiction.
It is clear that, while most writers enjoy picturing the Negro as a woolly-headed, humble old agrarian who mutters yassuhs and sho' nufs with blissful deference to his white employer ( or, in Old South terms, massuh ), this stereotype is doomed to become in reality as obsolete as Caldwell's Lester.
While there may still be many Faulknerian Lucas Beauchamps scattered through the rural South, such men appear to be a vanishing breed.
Writers openly admit that the Negro is easier to write than the white man ; but they obviously mean by this, not a Negro personality, but a Negro type.
Presenting an individualized Negro character, it would seem, is one of the most difficult assignments a Southern writer could tackle ; and the success of such an endeavor is, as suggested above, glaringly rare.
Just as the Negro situation points up the gradual and abrupt changes affecting Southern life, it also points up the non-representation of urbanism in Southern literature.
The book concerned with the Negro's role in an urban society is rare indeed ; recently only Keith Wheeler's novel, Peaceable Lane, has openly faced the problem.
All but the most rabid of Confederate flag wavers admit that the Old Southern tradition is defunct in actuality and sigh that its passing was accompanied by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic traditions of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life.
Many earlier writers, mourning the demise of the old order, tended to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious Old South imagery, creating such lasting impressions as Margaret Mitchell's Tara Plantation.
Modern writers, who are supposed to keep their fingers firmly upon the pulse of their subjects, insist upon drawing out this legend, prolonging its burial, when it well deserves a rest after the overexploitation of the past century.
Perhaps these writers have been too deeply moved by this romanticizing ; but they can hardly deny that, exaggerated or not, the old panorama is dead.
As John T. Westbrook says in his article, Twilight Of Southern Regionalism ( Southwest Review, Winter 1957 ) : the miasmal mausoleum where an Old South, already too minutely autopsied in prose and poetry, should be left to rest in peace, forever dead and ( let us fervently hope ) forever done with.
Westbrook further bemoans the Southern writers' creation of an unreal image of their homeland, which is too readily assimilated by both foreign readers and visiting Yankees : our northerner is suspicious of all this crass evidence ( of urbanization ) presented to his senses.
It bewilders and befuddles him.
He is too deeply steeped in William Faulkner and Robert Penn Warren.
The fumes of progress are in his nose and the bright steel of industry towers before his eyes, but his heart is away in Yoknapatawpha County with razorback hogs and night riders.
On this trip to the South he wants, above all else, to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight.
Obviously, such a Northern tourist's purpose is somewhat akin to a child's experience with Disneyland : he wants to see a world of make-believe.
In the meantime, while the South has been undergoing this phenomenal modernization that is so disappointing to the curious Yankee, Southern writers have certainly done little to reflect and promote their region's progress.
Willard Thorp, in his new book, American Writing In The Twentieth Century, observes, quite validly it seems : certain subjects are conspicuously absent or have been only lightly touched.
No Southern novelist has done for Atlanta or Birmingham what Herrick, Dreiser, and Farrell did for Chicago or Dos Passos did for New York.
There are almost no fictional treatments of the industrialized south.
Not a single Southern author, major or minor, has made the urban problems of an urban South his primary source material.
Faulkner, for one, appears to be safe from the accusing fingers of all assailants in this regard.
Faulkner culminates the Southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it has ever been, or could ever be, done.
He has made it his, and his it remains, irrevocably.
He treats it with a mythological, universal application.
As his disciples boast, even though his emphasis is elsewhere, Faulkner does show his awareness of the changing order of the South quite keenly, as can be proven by a quick recalling of his Sartoris and Snopes families.
Even two decades ago in Go Down, Moses Faulkner was looking to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through its youth and its new way of life the South might be reborn and the curse of slavery erased from its soil.
Yet his concern even here is with a slowly changing socio-economic order in general, and he never deals with such specific aspects of this change as the urban and industrial impact.
Faulkner traces, in his vast and overpowering saga of Yoknapatawpha County, the gradual changes which seep into the South, building layer upon layer of minute, subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the Old Way.
Thus Faulkner reminds us, and wisely, that the new South has gradually evolved out of the Old South, and consequently its agrarian roots persist.
Yet he presents a realm of source material which may well serve other writers if not himself : the problems with which a New South must grapple in groping through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization.
With new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six men : a machine stands between the agrarian and his soil.
The thousands of city migrants who desert the farms yearly must readjust with even greater stress and tension : the sacred wilderness is gradually surrendering to suburbs and research parks and industrial areas.
Another element to concern the choreographer is that of the visual devices of the theatre.
Most avant-garde creators, true to their interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement, have tended to dress their dancers in simple lines and solid colors ( often black ) and to give them a bare cyclorama for a setting.
But Robert Rauschenberg, the neo-dadaist artist, has collaborated with several of them.
He has designed a matching backdrop and costumes of points of color on white for Mr. Cunningham's Summerspace, so that dancers and background merge into a shimmering unity.
For Mr. Taylor's Images And Reflections she made some diaphanous tents that alternately hide and reveal the performer, and a girl's cape lined with grass.
Mr. Nikolais has made a distinctive contribution to the arts of costume and decor.
In fact, he calls his productions dance-theatre works of motion, shape, light, and sound.
To raise the dancer out of his personal, pedestrian self, Mr. Nikolais has experimented with relating him to a larger, environmental orbit.
He began with masks to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appeared to be.
He went on to use objects -- hoops, poles, capes -- which he employed as extensions of the body of the dancer, who moved with them.
The depersonalization continued as the dancer was further metamorphosed by the play of lights upon his figure.
In each case, the object, the color, even the percussive sounds of the electronic score were designed to become part of the theatrical being of the performer.
The dancer who never loosens her hold on a parasol, begins to feel that it is part of herself.
Or, clad from head to toe in fabric stretched over a series of hoops, the performer may well lose his sense of self in being a finial.
As the dancer is depersonalized, his accouterments are animized, and the combined elements give birth to a new being.
From this being come new movement ideas that utilize dancer and property as a single unit.
Thus, the avant-garde choreographers have extended the scope of materials available for dance composition.
But, since they have rejected both narrative and emotional continuity, how are they to unify the impressive array of materials at their disposal?
Some look deliberately to devices used by creators in the other arts and apply corresponding methods to their own work.
Others, less consciously but quite probably influenced by the trends of the times, experiment with approaches that parallel those of the contemporary poet, painter, and musician.
An approach that has appealed to some choreographers is reminiscent of Charles Olson's statement of the process of projective verse : one perception must immediately and directly lead to a further perception.
The creator trusts his intuition to lead him along a path that has internal validity because it mirrors the reality of his experience.
He disdains external restrictions -- conventional syntax, traditional metre.
The unit of form is determined subjectively : the Heart, by the way of the Breath, to the Line.
The test of form is fidelity to the experience, a gauge also accepted by the abstract expressionist painters.
An earlier but still influential school of painting, surrealism, had suggested the way of dealing with the dream experience, that event in which seemingly incongruous objects are linked together through the curious associations of the subconscious.
The resulting picture might appear a maze of restless confusions and contradictions, but it is more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrived order.
The contemporary painter tends to depict not the concrete objects of his experience but their essences as revealed in abstractions of their lines, colors, masses, and energies.
He is still concerned, however, with a personal event.
He accepts the accidents of his brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation.
The work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience.
Some painters have less interest in the experience of the moment, with its attendant urgencies and ambiguities, than in looking beyond the flux of particular impressions to a higher, more serene level of truth.
Rather than putting their trust in ephemeral sensations they seek form in the stable relationships of pure design, which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world.
The concept remains subjective.
But in this approach it is the artist's ultimate insight, rather than his immediate impressions, that gives form to the work.
Others look to more objective devices of order.
The musician employing the serial technique of composition establishes a mathematical system of rotations that, once set in motion, determines the sequence of pitches and even of rhythms and intensities.
The composer may reverse or invert the order of his original set of intervals ( or rhythms or dynamic changes ).
He may even alter the pattern by applying a scheme of random numbers.
But he cannot order his elements by will, either rational or inspired.
The system works as an impersonal mechanism.
Musicians who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development.
Again, the composer must select his own materials.
But a tossing of coins, with perhaps the added safeguard of reference to the oracles of the I Ching, the Chinese Book Of Changes, dictates the handling of the chosen materials.
Avant-garde choreographers, seeking new forms of continuity for their new vocabulary of movements, have turned to similar approaches.
Some let dances take their form from the experience of creation.
According to Katherine Litz, the becoming, the process of realization, is the dance.
The process stipulates that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he has discovered and that he feel the rightness of the quality that is to follow it.
The sequence may involve a sharp contrast : for example, a quiet meditative sway of the body succeeded by a violent leap ; or it may involve more subtle distinctions : the sway may be gradually minimized or enlarged, its rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modified, or it may be transferred to become a movement of only the arms or the head.
Even the least alteration will change the quality.
An exploration of these possible relationships constitutes the process of creation and thereby gives form to the dance.
The approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic, as it is for Miss Litz, or spontaneous, as it is for Merle Marsicano.
She, too, is concerned with the becoming, the process of realization, but she does not think in terms of subtle variations of spatial or temporal patterns.
The design is determined emotionally : I must reach into myself for the spring that will send me catapulting recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confronts me.
Looking back, Miss Marsicano feels that her ideas may have been influenced by those of Jackson Pollock.
At one time she felt impelled to make dances that moved all over the stage, much as Pollock's paintings move violently over the full extent of the canvas.
But her conscious need was to break away from constricting patterns of form, a need to let the experience shape itself.
Midi Garth also believes in subjective continuity that begins with the feeling engendered by an initial movement.
It may be a free front-back swing of the leg, leading to a sideways swing of the arm that develops into a turn and the sensation of taking off from the ground.
This became a dance called Prelude To Flight.
A pervading quality of free lyricism and a building from turns close to the ground towards jumps into the air gives the work its central focus.
Alwin Nikolais objects to art as an outpouring of personal emotion.
He seeks to make his dancers more godlike by relating them to the impersonal elements of shape, light, color, and sound.
If his dancers are sometimes made to look as if they might be creatures from Mars, this is consistent with his intention of placing them in the orbit of another world, a world in which they are freed of their pedestrian identities.
It is through the metamorphosed dancer that the germ of form is discovered.
In his recognition of his impersonal self the dancer moves, and this self, in the first revealed stroke of its existence, states the theme from which all else must follow.
The theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shapes evolve.
It may be a reaction to a percussive sound, the following movements constituting further reactions.
It may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color, in which case changes in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual designs.
Unconcerned with the practical function of his actions, the dancer is engrossed exclusively in their motional content.
Movements unfold freely because they are uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive.
But the metamorphosis must come first.
Though he is also concerned with freeing dance from pedestrian modes of activity, Merce Cunningham has selected a very different method for achieving his aim.
He rejects all subjectively motivated continuity, any line of action related to the concept of cause and effect.
He bases his approach on the belief that anything can follow anything.
An order can be chanced rather than chosen, and this approach produces an experience that is free and discovered rather than bound and remembered.
Thus, there is freshness not only in the individual movements of the dance but in the shape of their continuity as well.
Chance, he finds, enables him to create a world beyond imagination.
He cites with pleasure the comment of a lady, who exclaimed after a concert : why, it's extremely interesting.
But I would never have thought of it myself.
The sequence of movements in a Cunningham dance is unlike any sequence to be seen in life.
At one side of the stage a dancer jumps excitedly ; nearby, another sits motionless, while still another is twirling an umbrella.
A man and a girl happen to meet ; they look straight at the audience, not at each other.
He lifts her, puts her down, and walks off, neither pleased nor disturbed, as if nothing had happened.
If one dancer slaps another, the victim may do a pirouette, sit down, or offer his assailant a fork and spoon.
Events occur without apparent reason.
Their consequences are irrelevant -- or there are no consequences at all.
The sequence is determined by chance, and Mr. Cunningham makes use of any one of several chance devices.
He may toss coins ; he may take slips of paper from a grab bag.
The answers derived by these means may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also its spatial design, special slips designating the location on the stage where the movement is to be performed.
The other variables include the dancer who is to perform the movement and the length of time he is to take in its performance.
The only factors that are personally set by the choreographer are the movements themselves, the number of the dancers, and the approximate total duration of the dance.
The approximate is important, because even after the order of the work has been established by the chance method, the result is not inviolable.
Each performance may be different.
If a work is divided into several large segments, a last-minute drawing of random numbers may determine the order of the segments for any particular performance.
And any sequence can not only change its positions in the work but can even be eliminated from it altogether.
Mr. Cunningham tries not to cheat the chance method ; he adheres to its dictates as faithfully as he can.
However, there is always the possibility that chance will make demands the dancers find impossible to execute.
Then the choreographer must arbitrate.
He must rearrange matters so that two performers do not bump into each other.
He must construct transitions so that a dancer who is told to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap.
The North and the South were in greater agreement on sovereignty, through all their dispute about it, than were the Founding Fathers.
The truth in their conflicting concepts was expounded by statesmen of the calibre of Webster and Calhoun, and defended in the end by leaders of the nobility of Lincoln and Lee.
The people everywhere had grown meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principles, in understanding of and belief in the federal balance, and in love of their Union.
Repeated efforts -- beginning with the Missouri Compromise of 1821 -- were made by such master moderates as Clay and Douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise, rather than clear thought and timely action.
Even so, confusion in this period gained such strength ( from compromise and other factors ) that it led to the bloodiest war of the Nineteenth century.
Nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic peoples that lies in even relatively slight deviation from their true concept of sovereignty.
The present issue in Atlantica -- whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nations into a federal union of sovereign citizens -- resembles the American one of 1787-89 rather than the one that was resolved by Civil War.
And so I would only touch upon it now ( much as I have long wanted to write a book about it ).
I think it is essential, however, to pinpoint here the difference between the two concepts of sovereignty that went to war in 1861 -- if only to see better how imperative is our need today to clarify completely our far worse confusion on this subject.
The difference came down to this : the Southern States insisted that the United States was, in last analysis, what its name implied -- a Union of States.
To their leaders the Constitution was a compact made by the people of sovereign states, who therefore retained the right to secede from it.
This right of the State, its upholders contended, was essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralizing power in the Union government.
The champions of the Union maintained that the Constitution had formed, fundamentally, the united people of America, that it was a compact among sovereign citizens rather than states, and that therefore the states had no right to secede, though the citizens could.
Writing to Speed on August 24, 1855, Lincoln made the latter point clear.
In homely terms whose timeliness is startling today, he thus declared his own right to secede.
We began by declaring that all men are created equal.
We now practically read it, all men are created equal except Negroes.
When the Know-nothings get control, it will read, all men are created equal except Negroes and foreigners and Catholics.
When it comes to this, I shall prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretence of loving liberty -- to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, without the base alloy of hypocrisy ( his emphasis ).
When the Southern States exercised their right to secede, they formed what they officially styled The Confederate States of America.
Dictionaries, as we have seen, still cite this government, along with the Articles of Confederation of 1781, as an example of a confederacy.
The fact is that the Southern Confederacy differed from the earlier one almost as much as the Federal Constitution did.
The Confederate Constitution copied much of the Federal Constitution verbatim, and most of the rest in substance.
It operated on, by and for the people individually just as did the Federal Constitution.
It made substantially the same division of power between the central and state governments, and among the executive, legislative and judicial branches.
The difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861 many believe -- and understandably -- that the great difference between the Constitution of the Southern Confederacy and the Federal Constitution was that the former recognized the right of each state to secede.
But though each of its members had asserted this right against the Union, the final Constitution which the Confederacy signed on March 11 -- nearly a month before hostilities began -- included no explicit provision authorizing a state to secede.
Its drafters discussed this vital point but left it out of their Constitution.
Their President, Jefferson Davis, interpreted their Constitution to mean that it admits of no coerced association, but this remained so doubtful that there were frequent demands that the right to secede be put into the Constitution.
The Constitution of the Southern Confederation differed from that of the Federal Union only in two important respects : it openly, defiantly, recognized slavery -- an institution which the Southerners of 1787, even though they continued it, found so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoided mentioning the word in the Federal Constitution.
They recognized that slavery was a moral issue and not merely an economic interest, and that to recognize it explicitly in their Constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they had set forth in the Declaration of 1776 that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among them are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
The other important difference between the two Constitutions was that the President of the Confederacy held office for six ( instead of four ) years, and was limited to one term.
These are not, however, differences in federal structure.
The only important differences from that standpoint, between the two Constitutions, lies in their Preambles.
The one of 1861 made clear that in making their government the people were acting through their states, whereas the Preamble of 1787-89 expressed, as clearly as language can, the opposite concept, that they were acting directly as citizens.
Here are the two Preambles : Federal Constitution, 1789 we the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.
Confederate Constitution, 1861 we the people of the Confederate States, each state acting in its sovereign and independent character, in order to form a permanent federal government, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity -- invoking the favor and the guidance of Almighty God -- do ordain and establish this Constitution for the Confederate States of America.
One is tempted to say that, on the difference between the concepts of sovereignty in these two preambles, the worst war of the Nineteenth century was fought.
But though the Southern States, when drafting a constitution to unite themselves, narrowed the difference to this fine point by omitting to assert the right to secede, the fact remained that by seceding from the Union they had already acted on the concept that it was composed primarily of sovereign states.
If the Union conceded this to them, the same right must be conceded to each remaining state whenever it saw fit to secede : this would destroy the federal balance between it and the states, and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the states all the liberty the citizens had gained by their Union.
Lincoln saw that the act of secession made the issue for the Union a vital one : whether it was a Union of sovereign citizens that should continue to live, or an association of sovereign states that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism.
Much as he abhorred slavery, Lincoln was always willing to concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it.
Though his election was interpreted by many Southerners as the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the Union, Lincoln himself proposed no such change in the rights the Constitution gave the states.
After the war began, he long refused to permit emancipation of the slaves by Union action even in the Border States that stayed with the Union.
He issued his Emancipation Proclamation only when he felt that necessity left him no other way to save the Union.
In his Message of December 2, 1862, he put his purpose and his policy in these words -- which I would call the Lincoln Law of Liberty-and-*union : in giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free.
What Lincoln could not concede was that the states rather than the people were sovereign in the Union.
He fought to the end to preserve it as a government of the people, by the people, for the people.
The truth on each side won in the civil war the fact that the Americans who upheld the sovereignty of their states did this in order to keep many of their people more securely in slavery -- the antithesis of individual liberty -- made the conflict grimmer, and the greater.
Out of this ordeal the citizen emerged, in the South as in the North, as America's true sovereign, in a new birth of freedom, as Lincoln promised.
But before this came about, 214,938 Americans had given their lives in battle for the two concepts of the sovereign rights of men and of states.
On their decisive battlefield Lincoln did not distinguish between them when he paid tribute to the brave men, living and dead, who fought here.
He understood that both sides were at fault, and he reached the height of saying so explicitly in his Second Inaugural.
To my knowledge, Lincoln remains the only Head of State and Commander-in-*chief who, while fighting a fearful war whose issue was in doubt, proved man enough to say this publicly -- to give his foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there is some error, and in all our error, some truth.
So great a man could not but understand, too, that the thing that moves men to sacrifice their lives is not the error of their thought, which their opponents see and attack, but the truth which the latter do not see -- any more than they see the error which mars the truth they themselves defend.
It is much less difficult now than in Lincoln's day to see that on both sides sovereign Americans had given their lives in the Civil War to maintain the balance between the powers they had delegated to the States and to their Union.
They differed in the balance they believed essential to the sovereignty of the citizen -- but the supreme sacrifice each made served to maintain a still more fundamental truth : that individual life, liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two -- and on the limitation of sovereignty, in all its aspects, which this involves.
The 140,414 Americans who gave the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion, preserved individual freedom in the United States from the dangers of anarchy, inherent in confederations, which throughout history have proved fatal in the end to all associations composed primarily of sovereign states, and to the liberties of their people.
But the fact that 70,524 other Americans gave the same measure of devotion to an opposing concept served Liberty-and-*union in other essential ways.
Its appeal from ballots to bullets at Fort Sumter ended by costing the Southerners their right to have slaves -- a right that was even less compatible with the sovereignty of man.
The very fact that they came so near to winning by the wrong method, war, led directly to their losing both the war and the wrong thing they fought for, since it forced Lincoln to free their slaves as a military measure.
There was a divine justice in one wrong thus undoing another.
There was also a lesson, one that has served ever since to keep Americans, in their conflicts with one another, from turning from the ballot to the bullet.
Yet though the Southern States lost the worst errors in their case, they did not lose the truth they fought for.
The lives so many of them gave, to forestall what they believed would be a fatal encroachment by the Union on the powers reserved to their states have continued ever since to safeguard all Americans against freedom's other foe.
As cells coalesced into organisms, they built new unnatural and internally controlled environments to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing properties of the external world.
The useful suggestion of Professor David Hawkins which considers culture as a third stage in biological evolution fits quite beautifully then with our suggestion that science has provided us with a rather successful technique for building protective artificial environments.
One wonders about its applicability to people.
Will advances in human sciences help us build social structures and governments which will enable us to cope with people as effectively as the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid built a structure of molecules which enabled it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction?
The answer is, of course, yes.
For the family is the simplest example of just such a unit, composed of people, which gives us both some immunity from, and a way of dealing with, other people.
Social invention did not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire had to await Lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulations of Archimedes.
But it has been during the last two centuries, during the scientific revolution, that our independence from the physical environment has made the most rapid strides.
We have ample light when the sun sets ; the temperature of our homes is independent of the seasons ; we fly through the air, although gravity pulls us down ; the range of our voice ignores distance.
At what stage are social sciences then?
Is the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of Newton?
There is a haunting resemblance between the notion of cause in Copernicus and in Freud.
And it is certainly no slight to either of them to compare both their achievements and their impact.
Political theoretical understanding, although almost at a standstill during this century, did develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and resulted in a flood of inventions which increased the possibility for man to coexist with man.
Consitutional government, popular vote, trial by jury, public education, labor unions, cooperatives, communes, socialized ownership, world courts, and the veto power in world councils are but a few examples.
Most of these, with horrible exceptions, were conceived as is a ship, not as an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind, nor to deny its force, but as a means to survive and enjoy it.
The most effective political inventions seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and are aware that restraining breakwaters can play only a minor part in the whole scheme.
Just as present technology had to await the explanations of physics, so one might expect that social invention will follow growing sociological understanding.
We are desperately in the need of such invention, for man is still very much at the mercy of man.
In fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction is day by day increasing our fear of each other.
3 I want, therefore, to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science, the connection between scientific understanding and fear.
There are certainly large areas of understanding in the human sciences which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel our present fears.
Lucretius has remarked : the reason why all Mortals are so gripped by fear is that they see all sorts of things happening in the earth and sky with no discernable cause, and these they attribute to the will of God.
Perhaps things were even worse then.
It is difficult to reconstruct the primeval fears of man.
We get some clue from a few remembrances of childhood and from the circumstance that we are probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever was.
We are not now afraid of atomic bombs in the same way that people once feared comets.
The bombs are as harmless as an automobile in a garage.
We are worried about what people may do with them -- that some crazy fool may push the button.
I am certainly not adequately trained to describe or enlarge on human fears, but there are certain features of the fears dispelled by scientific explanations that stand out quite clearly.
They are in general those fears that once seemed to have been amenable to prayer or ritual.
They include both individual fears and collective ones.
They arise in situations in which one believes that what happens depends not only on the external world, but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group.
Often it is recognized that all the details of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but, because the pattern was empirically determined and not developed through theoretical understanding, one is never quite certain which behavior elements are effective, and the whole pattern becomes ritualized.
Yet often fear persists because, even with the most rigid ritual, one is never quite free from the uneasy feeling that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one had been unaware of the really decisive act.
To say that science had reduced many such fears merely reiterates the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminated much of magic and superstition.
But a somewhat more detailed analysis of this process may be illuminating.
The frequently postulated antique worry that the daylight hours might dwindle to complete darkness apparently gave rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize.
It is curious that even centuries of repetition of the yearly cycle did not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremonies of the winter solstice.
This and other fears of the solar system have disappeared gradually, first, with the Ptolemaic system and its built-in concept of periodicity and then, more firmly, with the Newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motions.
This understanding provides a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without instituting any controls.
In fact, although we have dispelled the fear, we have not necessarily assured ourselves that there are no dangers.
There is still the remote possibility of planetoid collision.
A meteor could fall on San Francisco.
Solar activities could presumably bring long periods of flood or drought.
Our understanding of the solar system has taught us to replace our former elaborate rituals with the appropriate action which, in this case, amounts to doing nothing.
Yet we no longer feel uneasy.
This almost trivial example is nevertheless suggestive, for there are some elements in common between the antique fear that the days would get shorter and shorter and our present fear of war.
We, in our country, think of war as an external threat which, if it occurs, will not be primarily of our own doing.
And yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depends in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the details of how we behave.
What elements of our behavior are decisive?
Our weapons production, our world prestige, our ideas of democracy, our actions of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage?
We have staved off a war and, since our behavior has involved all these elements, we can only keep adding to our ritual without daring to abandon any part of it, since we have not the slightest notion which parts are effective.
I think that we are here also talking of the kind of fear that a young boy has for a group of boys who are approaching at night along the streets of a large city.
If an automobile were approaching him, he would know what was required of him, even though he might not be able to act quickly enough.
With the group of boys it is different.
He does not know whether to look up or look aside, to put his hands in his pockets or to clench them at his side, to cross the street, or to continue on the same side.
When confronted with a drunk or an insane person I have no notion of what any one of them might do to me or to himself or to others.
I believe that what I do has some effect on his actions and I have learned, in a way, to commune with drunks, but certainly my actions seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carrying out of an experiment in physics.
I am usually filled with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose.
Our inability to explain why certain people are fond of us frequently induces the same kind of ritual and malaise.
We are forced, in our behavior towards others, to adopt empirically successful patterns in toto because we have such a minimal understanding of their essential elements.
Our collective policies, group and national, are similarly based on voodoo, but here we often lack even the empirically successful rituals and are still engaged in determing them.
We use terms from our personal experience with individuals such as trust, cheat, and get tough.
We talk about national character in the same way that Copernicus talked of the compulsions of celestial bodies to move in circles.
We perform elaborate international exhortations and ceremonies with virtually no understanding of social cause and effect.
Small wonder, then, that we fear.
The achievements which dispelled our fears of the cosmos took place three centuries ago.
What additional roles has the scientific understanding of the 19th and 20th centuries played?
In the physical sciences, these achievements concern electricity, chemistry, and atomic physics.
In the life sciences, there has been an enormous increase in our understanding of disease, in the mechanisms of heredity, and in bio- and physiological chemistry.
The major effect of these advances appears to lie in the part they have played in the industrial revolution and in the tools which scientific understanding has given us to build and manipulate a more protective environment.
In addition, our way of dealing directly with natural phenomena has also changed.
Even in domains where detailed and predictive understanding is still lacking, but where some explanations are possible, as with lightning and weather and earthquakes, the appropriate kind of human action has been more adequately indicated.
Apparently the population as a whole eventually acquires enough confidence in the explanations of the scientists to modify its procedures and its fears.
How and why this process occurs would provide an interesting separate subject for study.
In some areas, the progress is slower than in others.
In agriculture, for example, despite the advances in biology, elaborate rituals tend to persist along with a continued sense of the imminence of some natural disaster.
In child care, the opposite extreme prevails ; procedures change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceeds anything warranted by established psychological theory.
There are many domains in which understanding has brought about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear.
Much of the former extreme uneasiness associated with visions and hallucinations and with death has disappeared.
The persistent horror of having a malformed child has, I believe, been reduced, not because we have gained any control over this misfortune, but precisely because we have learned that we have so little control over it.
In fact, the recent warnings about the use of *j have introduced fears and ambiguities of action which now require more detailed understanding, and thus in this instance, science has momentarily aggravated our fears.
In fact, insofar as science generates any fear, it stems not so much from scientific prowess and gadgets but from the fact that new unanswered questions arise, which, until they are understood, create uncertainty.
Perhaps the most illuminating example of the reduction of fear through understanding is derived from our increased knowledge of the nature of disease.
The situation with regard to our attitude and control of disease contains close analogies to problems confronting us with respect to people.
The fear of disease was formerly very much the kind of fear I have tried to describe.
Nothing like Godot, he arrived before the hour.
His letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on Sunday, and I came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve.
He was waiting.
My wish to meet Samuel Beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work.
American newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic.
They find deep pessimism in them.
Even so astute a commentator as Harold Clurman of The Nation has said that Waiting For Godot is the concentrate of the contemporary European mood of despair.
But to me Beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that I could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism.
Could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me?
Is his a literature of defeat, irrelevant to the social crises we face?
Or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?
I knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions, because a man is not the same as his writing : in the last analysis, the questions had to be settled by the work itself.
Nevertheless I was curious.
My curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation I had with a well-informed teacher of literature, a Jesuit father, at a conference on religious drama near Paris.
When Beckett's name came into the discussion, the priest grew loud and told me that Beckett hates life.
That, I thought, is at least one thing I can find out when we meet.
Beckett's appearance is rough-hewn Irish.
The features of his face are distinct, but not fine.
They look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel.
Unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead, standing so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle.
One might say it combines the man ; own pride and humility.
For he has the pride that comes of self-acceptance and the humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to impose himself upon another.
His light blue eyes, set deep within the face, are actively and continually looking.
He seems, by some unconscious division of labor, to have given them that one function and no other, leaving communication to the rest of the face.
The mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile.
The voice is light in timbre, with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage.
The Irish accent is, as one would expect, combined with slight inflections from the French.
His tweed suit was a baggy gray and green.
He wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie.
We walked down the Rue De L'*arcade, thence along beside the Madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church.
The conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called world-shattering.
For one thing, the world that Beckett sees is already shattered.
His talk turns to what he calls the mess, or sometimes this buzzing confusion.
I reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation.
What appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words.
The confusion is not my invention.
We cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion.
It is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in.
The only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess.
It is not a mess you can make sense of.
I suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth, but Beckett did not take to the word truth.
What is more true than anything else?
To swim is true, and to sink is true.
One is not more true than the other.
One cannot speak anymore of being, one must speak only of the mess.
When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, I don't know, but their language is too philosophical for me.
I am not a philosopher.
One can only speak of what is in front of him, and that now is simply the mess.
Then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form.
Until recently, art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things.
It has held them at bay.
It realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form.
How could the mess be admitted, because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be?
But now we can keep it out no longer, because we have come into a time when it invades our experience at every moment.
It is there and it must be allowed in.
I granted this might be so, but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously.
And why not?
How, I asked, could chaos be admitted to chaos?
Would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art?
If we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form.
Beckett's own work is an example.
Plays more highly formalized than Waiting For Godot, Endgame, and Krapp's Last Tape would be hard to find.
What I am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art.
It only means that there will be new form, and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else.
The form and the chaos remain separate.
The latter is not reduced to the former.
That is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation, because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates.
To find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of the artist now.
Yet, I responded, could not similar things be said about the art of the past?
Is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify, demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own never-predictable way?
What is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory?
Isn't all art ambiguous?
Not this, he said, and gestured toward the Madeleine.
The classical lines of the church which Napoleon thought of as a Temple of Glory, dominated all the scene where we sat.
The Boulevard De La Madeleine, the Boulevard Malesherbes, and the Rue Royale ran to it with graceful flattery, bearing tidings of the Age of Reason.
Not this.
This is clear.
This does not allow the mystery to invade us.
With classical art, all is settled.
But it is different at Chartres.
There is the unexplainable, and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer.
I asked about the battle between life and death in his plays.
Didi and Gogo hover on the edge of suicide ; Hamm's world is death and Clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside.
Is this life-death question a part of the chaos?
Yes.
If life and death did not both present themselves to us, there would be no inscrutability.
If there were only darkness, all would be clear.
It is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable.
Take Augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld : have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology?
Two thieves are crucified with Christ, one saved and the other damned.
How can we make sense of this division?
In classical drama, such problems do not arise.
The destiny of Racine's Phedre is sealed from the beginning : she will proceed into the dark.
As she goes, she herself will be illuminated.
At the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination, but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark.
That is the play.
Within this notion clarity is possible, but for us who are neither Greek nor Jansenist there is not such clarity.
The question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary -- total salvation.
But where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable.
The key word in my plays is perhaps.
Given a theological lead, I asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays.
Well, really there is none at all.
I have no religious feeling.
Once I had a religious emotion.
It was at my first Communion.
No more.
My mother was deeply religious.
So was my brother.
He knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel.
My father had none.
The family was Protestant, but for me it was only irksome and I let it go.
My brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died.
At the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie.
Irish Catholicism is not attractive, but it is deeper.
When you pass a church on an Irish bus, all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross.
One day the dogs of Ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs.
But do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with?
Yes, for they deal with distress.
Some people object to this in my writing.
At a party an English intellectual -- so-called -- asked me why I write always about distress.
As if it were perverse to do so ] he wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood.
I told him no, that I had had a very happy childhood.
Then he thought me more perverse than ever.
I left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi.
On the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs : one asked for help for the blind, another help for orphans, and the third for relief for the war refugees.
One does not have to look for distress.
It is screaming at you even in the taxis of London.
Lunch was over, and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of Paris screaming at us.
The personal quality of Samuel Beckett is similar to qualities I had found in the plays.
He says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern.
Perhaps stands in place of commitment.
At the same time, he is plainly sympathetic, clearly friendly.
If there were only the mess, all would be clear ; but there is also compassion.
As a Christian, I know I do not stand where Beckett stands, but I do see much of what he sees.
As a writer on the theater, I have paid close attention to the plays.
Harold Clurman is right to say that Waiting For Godot is a reflection ( he calls it a distorted reflection ) of the impasse and disarray of Europe's present politics, ethic, and common way of life.
Yet it is not only Europe the play refers to.
Waiting For Godot sells even better in America than in France.
The consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to Europe than to America, but it is the consciousness that most mature societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the not-strictly-practical ends of culture.
America is now joining Europe in this mature phase of development.
Whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of Asia and Africa, and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold.
Even Hemingway, for all his efforts to formulate a naturalistic morality in The Sun Also Rises and A Farewell To Arms never maintained that sex was all.
Hemingway's fiction is supported by a moral backbone and in its search for ultimate meaning hints at a religious dimension.
And D. H. Lawrence, in Fantasia Of The Unconscious, protested vehemently against the overestimation of the sexual motive.
Though sex in some form or other enters into all human activity and it was a good thing that Freud emphasized this aspect of human nature, it is fantastic to explain everything in terms of sex.
All is not sex, declared Lawrence.
Man is not confined to one outlet for his vital energy.
The creative urge, for example, transcends the body and the self.
But for the beat generation all is sex.
Nothing is more revealing of the way of life and literary aspirations of this group than their attitude toward sex.
For the beatnik, like the hipster, is in opposition to a society that is based on the repression of the sex instinct.
He has elevated sex -- not Eros or libido but pure, spontaneous, uninhibited sex -- to the rank of the godhead ; it is Astarte, Ishtar, Venus, Yahwe, Dionysus, Christ, the mysterious and divine orgone energy flowing through the body of the universe.
Jazz is sex, marijuana is a stimulus to sex, the beat tempo is adjusted to the orgiastic release of the sexual impulse.
Lawrence Lipton, in The Holy Barbarians, stresses that for the beat generation sex is more than a source of pleasure ; it is a mystique, and their private language is rich in the multivalent ambiguities of sexual reference so that they dwell in a sexualized universe of discourse.
The singular uncompromising force of their revolt against the cult of restraint is illustrated by their refusal to dance in a public place.
The dance is but a disguised ritual for the expression of ungratified sexual desire.
For this reason, too, their language is more forthright and earthy.
The beatniks crave a sexual experience in which their whole being participates.
It is therefore not surprising that they resist the lure of marriage and the trap of domesticity, for like cats they are determined not to tame their sexual energy.
They withdraw to the underground of the slums where they can defy the precepts of legalized propriety.
Unlike the heroes and flappers of the lost generation, they disdain the art of necking and petting.
That is reserved for the squares.
If they avoid the use of the pungent, outlawed four-letter word it is because it is taboo ; it is sacred.
As Lipton, the prophet of the beat generation, declares : in the sexual act, the beat are filled with mana, the divine power.
This is far from the vulgar, leering sexuality of the middle-class square in heat.
This is the Holy Grail these knights of the orgasm pursue, this is the irresistible cosmic urge to which they respond.
If Wilhelm Reich is the Moses who has led them out of the Egypt of sexual slavery, Dylan Thomas is the poet who offers them the Dionysian dialectic of justification for their indulgence in liquor, marijuana, sex, and jazz.
In addition, they have been converted to Zen Buddhism, with its glorification of all that is natural and mysteriously alive, the sense that everything in the world is flowing.
Thus, paradoxically, the beat writers resort to religious metaphors : they are in search of mana, the spiritual, the numinous, but not anything connected with formal religion.
What they are after is the beatific vision.
And Zen Buddhism, though it is extremely difficult to understand how these internal contradictions are reconciled, helps them in their struggle to achieve personal salvation through sexual release.
The style of life chosen by the beat generation, the rhythm and ritual they have adopted as uniquely their own, is designed to enhance the value of the sexual experience.
Jazz is good not only because it promotes wholeness but because of its decided sexual effect.
Jazz is the musical language of sex, the vocabulary of the orgasm ; indeed, it is maintained that the sexual element in jazz, by freeing the listener of his inhibitions, can have therapeutic value.
That is why, the argument runs, the squares are so fearful of jazz and yet perversely fascinated by it.
Instead of giving themselves spontaneously to the orgiastic release that jazz can give them, they undergo psychoanalysis or flirt with mysticism or turn to prostitutes for satisfaction.
Thus jazz is transmuted into something holy, the sacred road to integration of being.
Jazz, like sex, is a mystique.
It is not a substitute for sex but a dynamic expression of the creative impulse in unfettered man.
The mystique of sex, combined with marijuana and jazz, is intended to provide a design for living.
Those who are sexually liberated can become creatively alive and free, their instincts put at the service of the imagination.
Righteous in their denunciation of all that makes for death, the beat prophets bid all men become cool cats ; let them learn to swing freely, to let go, to become authentically themselves, and then perhaps civilization will be saved.
The beatnik, seceding from a society that is fatally afflicted with a deathward drive, is concerned with his personal salvation in the living present.
If he is the child of nothingness, if he is the predestined victim of an age of atomic wars, then he will consult only his own organic needs and go beyond good and evil.
He will not curb his instinctual desires but release the energy within him that makes him feel truly and fully alive, even if it is only for this brief moment before the apocalypse of annihilation explodes on earth.
That is why the members of the beat generation proudly assume the title of the holy barbarians ; they will destroy the shrines, temples, museums, and churches of the state that is the implacable enemy of the life they believe in.
Apart from the categorical imperative they derive from the metaphysics of the orgasm, the only affirmation they are capable of making is that art is their only refuge.
Their writing, born of their experiments in marijuana and untrammeled sexuality, reflects the extremity of their existential alienation.
The mind has betrayed them, reason is the foe of life ; they will trust only their physical sensations, the wisdom of the body, the holy promptings of the unconscious.
With lyrical intensity they reveal what they hate, but their faith in love, inspired by the revolutionary rhythms of jazz, culminates in the climax of the orgasm.
Their work mirrors the mentality of the psychopath, rootless and irresponsible.
Their rebellion against authoritarian society is not far removed from the violence of revolt characteristic of the juvenile delinquent.
And the life they lead is undisciplined and for the most part unproductive, even though they make a fetish of devoting themselves to some creative pursuit -- writing, painting, music.
They are non-conformists on principle.
When they express themselves it is incandescent hatred that shines forth, the rage of repudiation, the ecstasy of negation.
It is sex that obsesses them, sex that is at the basis of their aesthetic creed.
What they discuss with dialectical seriousness is the degree to which sex can inspire the Muse.
Monogamy is the vice from which the abjectly fearful middle class continue to suffer, whereas the beatnik has the courage to break out of that prison of respectability.
One girl describes her past, her succession of broken marriages, the abortions she has had and finally confesses that she loves sex and sees no reason why she must justify her passion.
If it is an honest feeling, then why should she not yield to it?
Most often, she says, it's the monogamous relationship that is dishonest.
There is nothing holy in wedlock.
This girl soon drops the bourgeois pyschiatrist who disapproves of her life.
She finds married life stifling and every prolonged sex relationship unbearably monotonous.
This confession serves to make clear in part what is behind this sexual revolution : the craving for sensation for its own sake, the need for change, for new experiences.
Boredom is death.
In the realm of physical sensations, sex reigns supreme.
Hence the beatniks sustain themselves on marijuana, jazz, free swinging poetry, exhausting themselves in orgies of sex ; some of them are driven over the borderline of sanity and lose contact with reality.
One beat poet composes a poem, Lines On A Tijuana John, which contains a few happy hints for survival.
The new fact the initiates of this cult have to learn is that they must move toward simplicity.
The professed mission of this disaffiliated generation is to find a new way of life which they can express in poetry and fiction, but what they produce is unfortunately disordered, nourished solely on the hysteria of negation.
Who are the creative representatives of this movement?
Nymphomaniacs, junkies, homosexuals, drug addicts, lesbians, alcoholics, the weak, the frustrated, the irresolute, the despairing, the derelicts and outcasts of society.
They embrace independent poverty, usually with a shack-up partner who will help support them.
They are full of contempt for the institution of matrimony.
Their previous legalized marriages do not count, for they hold the laws of the state null and void.
They feel they are leagued against a hostile, persecutory world, faced with the concerted malevolent opposition of squares and their hirelings, the police.
This is the rhetoric of righteousness the beatniks use in defending their way of life, their search for wholeness, though their actual existence fails to reach these religious heights.
One beatnik got the woman he was living with so involved in drugs and self-analysis and all-night sessions of sex that she was beginning to crack up.
What obsessions had she picked up during these long nights of talk?
Sex as the creative principle of the universe, the secret of primitive religion, the life of myth.
Everything in the final analysis reduced itself to sexual symbolism.
In his chapter on The Loveways Of The Beat Generation, Lipton spares the reader none of the sordid details.
No one asks questions about the free union of the sexes in West Venice so long as the partners share the negative attitudes of the group.
The women who come to West Venice, having forsaken radicalism, are interested in living only for the moment, in being constantly on the move.
Others who are attracted to this Mecca of the beat generation are homosexuals, heroin addicts, and smalltime hoodlums.
Those who are sexual deviants are naturally drawn to join the beatniks.
Since the homosexuals widely use marijuana, they do not have to be initiated.
Part of the ritual of sex is the use of marijuana.
As Lipton puts it : The Eros is felt in the magic circle of marijuana with far greater force, as a unifying principle in human relationships, than at any other time except, perhaps, in the mutual metaphysical orgasms.
The magic circle is, in fact, a symbol of and preparation for the metaphysical orgasm.
Under the influence of marijuana the beatnik comes alive within and experiences a wonderfully enhanced sense of self as if he had discovered the open sesame to the universe of being.
Carried high on this charge, he composes magical poetry that captures the organic rhythms of life in words.
If he thus achieves a lyrical, dreamlike, drugged intensity, he pays the price for his indulgence by producing work -- Allen Ginsberg's Howl is a striking example of this tendency -- that is disoriented, Dionysian but without depth and without Apollonian control.
For drugs are in themselves no royal road to creativity.
How is the beat poet to achieve unity of form when he is at the same time engaged in a systematic derangement of senses.
If love reflects the nature of man, as Ortega Y Gasset believes, if the person in love betrays decisively what he is by his behavior in love, then the writers of the beat generation are creating a new literary genre.
There were fences in the old days when we were children.
Across the front of a yard and down the side, they were iron, either spiked along the top or arched in half circles.
Alley fences were made of solid boards higher than one's head, but not so high as the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhocks that grew in a line against them.
Side fences were hidden beneath lilacs and hundred-leaf roses ; front fences were covered with Virginia creeper or trumpet vines or honeysuckle.
Square corner- and gate posts were an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage ; they were topped by steeples complete in every detail : high-pitched roof, pinnacle, and narrow gable.
On these posts the gates swung open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang.
The only extended view possible to anyone less tall than the fences was that obtained from an upper bough of the apple tree.
The primary quality of that view seems, now, to have been its quietness, but that cannot at the time have impressed us.
What one actually remembers is its greenness.
From high in the tree, the whole block lay within range of the eye, but the ground was almost nowhere visible.
One looked down on a sea of leaves, a breaking wave of flower.
Every path from back door to barn was covered by a grape-arbor, and every yard had its fruit trees.
In the center of any open space remaining our grandfathers had planted syringa and sweet-shrub, snowball, rose-of-*sharon and balm-of-*gilead.
From above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea : a neighbor's gingham skirt flashing into sight for an instant on the path beneath her grape-arbor, or the movement of hands above a clothesline and the flutter of garments hung there, half-way down the block.
That was one epoch : the apple-tree epoch.
Another had ended before it began.
Time is a queer thing and memory a queerer ; the tricks that time plays with memory and memory with time are queerest of all.
From maturity one looks back at the succession of years, counts them and makes them many, yet cannot feel length in the number, however large.
In a stream that turns a mill-wheel there is a lot of water ; the mill-pond is quiet, its surface dark and shadowed, and there does not seem to be much water in it.
Time in the sum is nothing.
And yet -- a year to a child is an eternity, and in the memory that phase of one's being -- a certain mental landscape -- will seem to have endured without beginning and without end.
The part of the mind that preserves dates and events may remonstrate, it could have been like that for only a little while ; but true memory does not count nor add : it holds fast to things that were and they are outside of time.
Once, then -- for how many years or how few does not matter -- my world was bound round by fences, when I was too small to reach the apple tree bough, to twist my knee over it and pull myself up.
That world was in scale with my own smallness.
I have no picture in my mind of the garden as a whole -- that I could not see -- but certain aspects of certain corners linger in the memory : wind-blown, frost-bitten, white chrysanthemums beneath a window, with their brittle brown leaves and their sharp scent of November ; ripe pears lying in long grass, to be turned over by a dusty-slippered foot, cautiously, lest bees still worked in the ragged, brown-edged holes ; hot-colored verbenas in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch, where we passed on our way to the pump with the half-gourd tied to it as a cup by my grandmother for our childish pleasure in drinking from it.
It was mother who planted the verbenas.
I think that my grandmother was not an impassioned gardener : she was too indulgent a lover of dogs and grandchildren.
My great-grandmother, I have been told, made her garden her great pride ; she cherished rare and delicate plants like oleanders in tubs and wall-flowers and lemon verbenas in pots that had to be wintered in the cellar ; she filled the waste spots of the yard with common things like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed, and the plantain lilies along the west side of the house.
These my grandmother left in their places ( they are still there, more persistent and longer-lived than the generations of man ) and planted others like them, that flourished without careful tending.
Three of these only were protected from us by stern commandment : the roses, whose petals might not be collected until they had fallen, to be made into perfume or rose-tea to drink ; the peonies, whose tight sticky buds would be blighted by the laying on of a finger, although they were not apparently harmed by the ants that crawled over them ; and the poppies.
I have more than once sat cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watched without touching while a poppy bud higher than my head slowly but visibly pushed off its cap, unfolded, and shook out like a banner in the sun its flaming vermilion petals.
Other flowers we might gather as we pleased : myrtle and white violets from beneath the lilacs ; the lilacs themselves, that bloomed so prodigally but for the most part beyond our reach ; snowballs ; hollyhock blossoms that, turned upside down, make pink-petticoated ladies ; and the little, dark blue larkspur that scattered its seed everywhere.
More potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few pictures and a few remembered facts would be a catalogue of the minutiae which are of the very stuff of the mind, intrinsic, because they were known in the beginning not by the eye alone but by the hand that held them.
Flowers, stones, and small creatures, living and dead.
Pale yellow snapdragons that by pinching could be made to bite ; seed-pods of the balsams that snapped like fire-crackers at a touch ; red-and-yellow columbines whose round-tipped spurs were picked off and eaten for the honey in them ; morning-glory buds which could be so grasped and squeezed that they burst like a blown-up paper bag ; bright flowers from the trumpet vine that made gloves on the ends of ten waggling fingers.
Fuzzy caterpillars, snails with their sensitive horns, struggling grasshoppers held by their long hind legs and commanded to spit tobacco, spit.
Dead fledgling birds, their squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that clung to the hand when they had been buried in our graveyard in front of the purple flags.
And the cast shell of a locust, straw-colored and transparent, weighing nothing, fragile but entire, with eyes like bubbles and a gaping slit down its back.
Every morning early, in the summer, we searched the trunks of the trees as high as we could reach for the locust shells, carefully detached their hooked claws from the bark where they hung, and stabled them, a weird faery herd, in an angle between the high roots of the tulip tree, where no grass grew in the dense shade.
We collected lucky stones -- all the creamy translucent pebbles, worn smooth and round, that we could find in the driveway.
When these had been pocketed, we could still spend a morning cracking open other pebbles for our delight in seeing how much prettier they were inside than their dull exteriors indicated.
We showed them to each other and said would you have guessed?
Squatting on our haunches beside the flat stone we broke them on, we were safe behind the high closed gates at the end of the drive : safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by.
Thus shielded, we played many foolish games in comfortable unselfconsciousness ; even when the fences became a part of the game -- when a vine-embowered gate-post was the Sleeping Beauty's enchanted castle, or when Rapunzel let down her golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire, even then we paid little heed to those who went by on the path outside.
We enjoyed a paradoxical freedom when we were still too young for school.
In the heat of the summer, the garden solitudes were ours alone ; our elders stayed in the dark house or sat fanning on the front porch.
They never troubled themselves about us while we were playing, because the fence formed such a definite boundary and don't go outside the gate was a command so impossible of misinterpretation.
We were not, however, entirely unacquainted with the varying aspects of the street.
We were forbidden to swing on the gates, lest they sag on their hinges in a poor-white-trash way, but we could stand on them, when they were latched, rest our chins on the top, and stare and stare, committing to memory, quite unintentionally, all the details that lay before our eyes.
The street that is full now of traffic and parked cars then and for many years drowsed on an August afternoon in the shade of the curbside trees, and silence was a weight, almost palpable, in the air.
Every slight sound that rose against that pressure fell away again, crushed beneath it.
A hay-wagon moved slowly along the gutter, the top of it swept by the low boughs of the maple trees, and loose straws were left hanging tangled among the leaves.
A wheel squeaked on a hub, was still, and squeaked again.
If a child watched its progress he whispered, hay, hay, load of hay -- make a wish and turn away, and then stared rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horses' feet returned no more.
When the hay wagon had gone, and an interval passed, a huckster's cart might turn the corner.
The horse walked, the reins were slack, the huckster rode with bowed shoulders, his forearms across his knees.
Sleepily, as if half-reluctant to break the silence, he lifted his voice : rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today ] the lazy sing-song was spaced in time like the drone of a bumble-bee.
No one seemed to hear him, no one heeded.
The horse plodded on, and he repeated his call.
It became so monotonous as to seem a part of the quietness.
After his passage, the street was empty again.
The sun moved slant-wise across the sky and down ; the trees' shadows circled from street to sidewalk, from sidewalk to lawn.
At four-o'clock, or four-thirty, the coming of the newsboy marked the end of the day ; he tossed a paper toward every front door, and housewives came down to their steps to pick them up and read what their neighbors had been doing.
The streets of any county town were like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer ; they were like this fifty-odd years ago, and yesterday.
But the fences were still in place fifty-odd years ago, and when we stood on the gate to look over, the sidewalk under our eyes was not cement but two rows of paving stones with grass between and on both sides.
The curb was a line of stone laid edgewise in the dirt and tilted this way and that by frost in the ground or the roots of trees.
Opposite every gate was a hitching post or a stone carriage-step, set with a rusty iron ring for tying a horse.
The street was unpaved and rose steeply toward the center ; it was mud in wet weather and dust, ankle-deep, in dry, and could be crossed only at the corner where there were stepping stones.
It had a bucolic atmosphere that it has lost long since.
The hoofmarks of cattle and the prints of bare feet in the mud or in the dust were as numerous as the traces of shod horses.
Cows were kept in backyard barns, boys were hired to drive them to and from the pasture on the edge of town, and familiar to the ear, morning and evening, were the boys' coaxing voices, the thud of hooves, and the thwack of a stick on cowhide.
It is worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story, because it brings together a number of characteristic elements and makes of them a curious, riddling compound obscurely but centrally significant for Mann's work.
The wife, Amra, and her lover are both savagely portrayed, she as incarnate sensuality, voluptuous and indolent, possibly a mischief maker, with a kind of luxurious cunning to set against her apparent simplicity, her birdlike brain.
Lautner, for his part, belonged to the present-day race of small artists, who do not demand the utmost of themselves, and the bitter description of the type includes such epithets as wretched little poseurs, the devastating indictment they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order, and the somewhat extreme prophecy, so far not fulfilled : they will be destroyed.
The trick these two play upon Jacoby reveals their want not simply of decency but of imagination as well.
His appearance as Lizzy evokes not amusement but horror in the audience ; it is a spectacle absolutely painful, an epiphany of the suffering flesh unredeemed by spirit, untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation.
At the same time the multiple transvestitism involved -- the fat man as girl and as baby, as coquette pretending to be a baby -- touches for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret sources of a life like Jacoby's, upon the sinister dreams which form the sources of any human life.
The music which Lautner has composed for this episode is for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal.
But it is characteristic of him, we are told, his little artifice, to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art.
And this occurs now, at the refrain of Jacoby's song -- at the point, in fact, of the name Lizzy -- ; a modulation described as almost a stroke of genius.
A miracle, a revelation, it was like a curtain suddenly torn away to reveal something nude.
It is this modulation which reveals to Jacoby his own frightful abjection and, simultaneously, his wife's infidelity.
By the same means he perceives this fact as having communicated itself to the audience ; he collapses, and dies.
In the work of every artist, I suppose, there may be found one or more moments which strike the student as absolutely decisive, ultimately emblematic of what it is all about ; not less strikingly so for being mysterious, as though some deeply hidden constatation of thoughts were enciphered in a single image, a single moment.
So here.
The horrifying humor, the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke gone wrong, the monstrous image of the fat man dressed up as a whore dressing up as a baby ; the epiphany of that quivering flesh ; the bringing together around it of the secret liaison between indolent, mindless sensuality and sharp, shrewd talent, cleverness with an occasional touch of genius ( which, however, does not know how to attack the problem of suffering ) ; the miraculous way in which music, revelation and death are associated in a single instant -- all this seems a triumph of art, a rather desperate art, in itself ; beyond itself, also, it evokes numerous and distant resonances from the entire body of Mann's work.
When I try to work out my reasons for feeling that this passage is of critical significance, I come up with the following ideas, which I shall express very briefly here and revert to in a later essay.
Love is the crucial dilemma of experience for Mann's heroes.
The dramatic construction of his stories characteristically turns on a situation in which someone is simultaneously compelled and forbidden to love.
The release, the freedom, involved in loving another is either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible ; and the motion toward it brings disaster.
This prohibition on love has an especially poignant relation to art ; it is particularly the artist ( Tonio Kroger, Aschenbach, Leverkuhn ) who suffers from it.
The specific analogy to the dilemma of love is the problem of the breakthrough in the realm of art.
Again, the sufferings and disasters produced by any transgression against the commandment not to love are almost invariably associated in one way or another with childhood, with the figure of a child.
Finally, the theatrical ( and perversely erotic ) notions of dressing up, cosmetics, disguise, and especially change of costume ( or singularity of costume, as with Cipolla ), are characteristically associated with the catastrophes of Mann's stories.
We shall return to these statements and deal with them more fully as the evidence for them accumulates.
For the present it is enough to note that in the grotesque figure of Jacoby, at the moment of his collapse, all these elements come together in prophetic parody.
Professionally a lawyer, that is to say associated with dignity, reserve, discipline, with much that is essentially middle-class, he is compelled by an impossible love to exhibit himself dressed up, disguised -- that is, paradoxically, revealed -- as a child, and, worse, as a whore masquerading as a child.
That this abandonment takes place on a stage, during an artistic performance, is enough to associate Jacoby with art, and to bring down upon him the punishment for art ; that is, he is suspect, guilty, punishable, as is anyone in Mann's stories who produces illusion, and this is true even though the constant elements of the artist-nature, technique, magic, guilt and suffering, are divided in this story between Jacoby and Lautner.
It appears that the dominant tendency of Mann's early tales, however pictorial or even picturesque the surface, is already toward the symbolic, the emblematic, the expressionistic.
In a certain perfectly definite way, the method and the theme of his stories are one and the same.
Something of this can be learned from The Way To The Churchyard ( 1901 ), an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a passing cyclist causes him to die of a stroke or seizure.
There is no more plot than that ; only slightly more, perhaps, than a newspaper account of such an incident would give.
The artistic interest, then, lies in what the encounter may be made to represent, in the power of some central significance to draw the details into relevance and meaningfulness.
The first sentence, with its platitudinous irony, announces an emblematic intent : the way to the churchyard ran along beside the highroad, ran beside it all the way to the end ; that is to say, to the churchyard.
And the action is consistently presented with regard for this distinction.
The highroad, one might say at first, belongs to life, while the way to the churchyard belongs to death.
But that is too simple, and won't hold up.
As the first sentence suggests, both roads belong to death in the end.
But the highroad, according to the description of its traffic, belongs to life as it is lived in unawareness of death, while the way to the churchyard belongs to some other sort of life : a suffering form, an existence wholly comprised in the awareness of death.
Thus, on the highroad, a troop of soldiers marched in their own dust and sang, while on the footpath one man walks alone.
This man's isolation is not merely momentary, it is permanent.
He is a widower, his three children are dead, he has no one left on earth ; also he is a drunk, and has lost his job on that account.
His name is Praisegod Piepsam, and he is rather fully described as to his clothing and physiognomy in a way which relates him to a sinister type in the author's repertory -- he is a forerunner of those enigmatic strangers in Death In Venice, for example, who represent some combination of cadaver, exotic, and psychopomp.
This strange person quarrels with a cyclist because the latter is using the path rather than the highroad.
The cyclist, a sufficiently commonplace young fellow, is not named but identified simply as Life -- that and a license number, which Piepsam uses in addressing him.
Life points out that everybody uses this path, and starts to ride on.
Piepsam tries to stop him by force, receives a push in the chest from Life, and is left standing in impotent and growing rage, while a crowd begins to gather.
His rage assumes a religious form ; that is, on the basis of his own sinfulness and abject wretchedness, Piepsam becomes a prophet who in his ecstasy and in the name of God imprecates doom on Life -- not only the cyclist now, but the audience, the world, as well : all you light-headed breed.
This passion brings on a fit which proves fatal.
Then an ambulance comes along, and they drive Praisegod Piepsam away.
This is simple enough, but several more points of interest may be mentioned as relevant.
The season, between spring and summer, belongs to life in its carefree aspect.
Piepsam's fatal rage arises not only because he cannot stop the cyclist, but also because God will not stop him ; as Piepsam says to the crowd in his last moments : his justice is not of this world.
Life is further characterized, in antithesis to Piepsam, as animal : the image of a dog, which appears at several places, is first given as the criterion of amiable, irrelevant interest aroused by life considered simply as a spectacle : a dog in a wagon is admirable, a pleasure to contemplate ; another wagon has no dog, and therefore is devoid of interest.
Piepsam calls the cyclist cur and puppy among other things, and at the crisis of his fit a little fox-terrier stands before him and howls into his face.
The ambulance is drawn by two charming little horses.
Piepsam is not, certainly, religious in any conventional sense.
His religiousness is intimately, or dialectically, connected with his sinfulness ; the two may in fact be identical.
His unsuccessful strivings to give up drink are represented as religious strivings ; he keeps a bottle in a wardrobe at home, and before this wardrobe Praisegod Piepsam had before now gone literally on his knees, and in his wrestlings had bitten his tongue -- and still in the end capitulated.
The cyclist, by contrast, blond and blue-eyed, is simply unreflective, unproblematic Life, blithe and carefree.
He made no claims to belong to the great and mighty of this earth.
Piepsam is grotesque, a disturbing parody ; his end is ridiculous and trivial.
He is a man raving mad on the way to the churchyard.
But he is more interesting than the others, the ones who come from the highroad to watch him, more interesting than Life considered as a cyclist.
And if I have gone into so much detail about so small a work, that is because it is also so typical a work, representing the germinal form of a conflict which remains essential in Mann's writing : the crude sketch of Piepsam contains, in its critical, destructive and self-destructive tendencies, much that is enlarged and illuminated in the figures of, for instance, Naphta and Leverkuhn.
In method as well as in theme this little anecdote with its details selected as much for expressiveness and allegory as for realism, anticipates a kind of musical composition, as well as a kind of fictional composition, in which, as Leverkuhn says, there shall be nothing unthematic.
It resembles, too, pictures such as Durer and Bruegel did, in which all that looks at first to be solely pictorial proves on inspection to be also literary, the representation of a proverb, for example, or a deadly sin.
Gladius Dei ( 1902 ) resembles The Way To The Churchyard in its representation of a conflict between light and dark, between Life and a spirit of criticism, negation, melancholy, but it goes considerably further in characterizing the elements of this conflict.
The monk Savonarola, brought over from the Renaissance and placed against the background of Munich at the turn of the century, protests against the luxurious works displayed in the art-shop of M. Bluthenzweig ; in particular against a Madonna portrayed in a voluptuous style and modeled, according to gossip, upon the painter's mistress.
Hieronymus, like Piepsam, makes his protest quite in vain, and his rejection, though not fatal, is ridiculous and humiliating ; he is simply thrown out of the shop by the porter.
On the street outside, Hieronymus envisions a holocaust of the vanities of this world, such a burning of artistic and erotic productions as his namesake actually brought to pass in Florence, and prophetically he issues his curse : gladius Dei super terram cito et velociter.
The reality to which they respond is rationally empty and their art is an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world.
Their artistic rationale is given to the witness of unreason.
These polar concerns ( imitation vs. formalism ) reflect a philosophical and religious situation which has been developing over a long period of time.
The breakdown of classical structures of meaning in all realms of western culture has given rise to several generations of artists who have documented the disintegrative processes.
Thus the image of man has suffered complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual qualities, and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic powers.
The image of the world tends to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty spaces and overwhelming mystery.
The image of God has simply disappeared.
All such imitations of negative quality have given rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism : if man can neither know nor love reality as it is, he can at least invent an artistic reality which is its own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective qualities capable of being known and worthy of being loved.
The person of the artist becomes a final bastion of meaning in a world rendered meaningless by the march of events and the decay of classical religious and philosophical systems.
Whatever pole of this contrast one emphasizes and whatever the tension between these two approaches to understanding the artistic imagination, it will be readily seen that they are not mutually exclusive, that they belong together.
Without the decay of a sense of objective reference ( except as the imitation of mystery ), the stress on subjective invention would never have been stimulated into being.
And although these insights into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art, their peculiar authenticity in this day and age requires that they be taken seriously and gives promise that from their very substance, new and valid chapters in the philosophy of art may be written.
For better or worse we cannot regard imitation in the arts in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detached realism.
A broader concept of imitation is needed, one which acknowledges that true invention is important, that the artist's creativity in part transcends the non-artistic causal factors out of which it arises.
On the other hand, we cannot regard artistic invention as pure, uncaused, and unrelated to the times in which it occurs.
We need a doctrine of imitation to save us from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism.
Accordingly, it is the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation ( which I shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from earlier theories of imitation ) and a new theory of invention ( which I shall call symbol for reasons to be stated hereafter ).
The mimetic imagination in the arts the word mimesis ( imitation ) is usually associated with Plato and Aristotle.
For Plato, imitation is twice removed from reality, being a poor copy of physical appearance, which in itself is a poor copy of ideal essence.
All artistic and mythological representations, therefore, are imitations of imitations and are completely superseded by the truth value of dialectic, the proper use of the inquiring intellect.
In Plato's judgment, the arts play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young, prior to the full development of their intellectual powers.
Presupposed in Plato's system is a doctrine of levels of insight, in which a certain kind of detached understanding is alone capable of penetrating to the most sublime wisdom.
Aristotle also tended to stratify all aspects of human nature and activity into levels of excellence and, like Plato, he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level.
The Poetics, in affirming that all human arts are modes of imitation, gives a more serious role to artistic mimesis than did Plato.
But Aristotle kept the principle of levels and even augmented it by describing in the Poetics what kinds of character and action must be imitated if the play is to be a vehicle of serious and important human truths.
For both Plato and Aristotle artistic mimesis, in contrast to the power of dialectic, is relatively incapable of expressing the character of fundamental reality.
The central concern of Erich Auerbach's impressive volume called Mimesis is to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation ( based upon a recognition of levels of truth ) to a Christian theory of imitation in which the levels are dissolved.
Following the theme of Incarnation in the Gospels, the Christian artist and critic sees in the most commonplace and ordinary events figures of divine power and reality.
Here artistic realism involves the audience in an impassioned participation in events whose overtones and implications are transcendent.
Artistic mimesis under Christian influence records the involvement of all persons, however humble, in a divine drama.
The artist, unlike the philosopher, is not a removed observer aiming at neutral and rarified high levels of abstraction.
He is the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he has been grasped.
I have chosen to use the word mimesis in its Christian rather than its classic implications and to discover in the concrete forms of both art and myth powers of theological expression which, as in the Christian mind, are the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience, which are not reserved, as in the Greek mind, only to moments of theoretical reflection.
In the first instance, mimesis is here used to mean the recalling of experience in terms of vivid images rather than in terms of abstract ideas or conventional designations.
By image is meant not only a visual presentation, but also remembered sensations of any of the five senses plus the feelings which are immediately conjoined therewith.
This is the primary function of the imagination operating in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the images were first appropriated.
Mimesis is the nearest possible thing to the actual re-living of experience, in which the imagining person recovers through images something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself.
The images themselves, like their counterparts in experience, are not neutral qualities to be surveyed dispassionately ; they are fields of force exerting a unique influence on the sensibilities and a unique relatedness to one another.
They bring an inextricable component of value within themselves, with attractions and repulsions native to their own quality.
As in experience one is seized by given entities and their interrelations and is forced to respond in value feelings to them, so one is similarly seized in the mimetic presentation of images.
Mimesis here is not to be confused with literalism or realism in the conventional sense.
A word taken in its dictionary meaning, a photographic image of a recognizable object, the mere picturing of a scene tends to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstractions as to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feelings.
Similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clues for behavior without awareness of the vitality of their experiential field.
A truly vivid imagination moves beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy.
The mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tends to express itself in the presentation of artistic forms and materials.
When words can be used in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sights and sounds, when tones of sound and colors of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibilities with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves, compelling the observer into an attitude of attention, all this imitates the way experience itself in its deepest character strikes upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance.
These are like the initial ways in which the world forces itself upon the self and thrusts the self into decision and choice.
The presence of genuine mimesis in art is marked by the persistence with which the work demands attention and compels valuation even though it is but vaguely understood.
Underlying these conceptions of mimesis are certain presuppositions concerning the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed.
Experience is not seen, as it is in classical rationalism, as presenting us initially with clear and distinct objects simply located in space and registering their character, movements, and changes on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect.
Neither is primary experience understood according to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing is thought to be received other than signals of sensory qualities producing their responses in the appropriate sense organs.
Primary feelings of the world come neither as a collection of clearly known objects ( houses, trees, implements, etc. ) nor a collection of isolated and neutral sensory qualities.
In contrast to all this, primary data are data of a self involved in environing processes and powers.
The most primitive feelings are rudimentary value feelings, both positive and negative : a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself ; a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part.
These desires presuppose a sense of causally efficacious powers in which one is involved, some working for one's good, others threatening ill.
Gone is the tabula rasa of the mind.
In its place is a passionate consciousness grasped and molded to feelings of positive or negative values even as the actions of one's life are determined by constellations of process in which one is caught.
The principal defender of this view of primary experience as causal efficacy is Alfred North Whitehead.
Our most elemental and unavoidable impressions, he says, are those of being involved in a large arena of powers which have a longer past than our own, which are interrelated in a vast movement through the present toward the future.
We feel the quality of these powers initially as in some degree wholesome or threatening.
Later abstractive and rational processes may indicate errors of judgment in these apprehensions of value, but the apprehensions themselves are the primary stuff of experience.
It takes a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of larger unities of power and influence and to view one's world simply as a collection of sense data arranged in such and such sequence and pattern, devoid of all power to move the feelings and actions except in so far as they present themselves for inspection.
Whitehead is here questioning David Hume's understanding of the nature of experience ; he is questioning, also, every epistemology which stems from Hume's presupposition that experience is merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy, and that causal efficacy is something intellectually imputed to the world, not directly perceived.
What Hume calls sensation is what Whitehead calls perception in the mode of presentational immediacy which is a sophisticated abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy.
As long as perception is seen as composed only of isolated sense data, most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence loses its objectivity, becomes an invention of consciousness, and the result is a philosophical scepticism.
Whitehead contends that the human way of understanding existence as a unity of interlocking and interdependent processes which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be is possible only because the basic form of such an understanding, for all its vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail, is initially given in the way man feels the world.
In this respect experience is broader and full of a richer variety of potential meanings than the mind of man or any of his arts or culture are capable of making clear and distinct.
A chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy is one of derivation from the past.
Both I and my feelings come up out of a chain of events that fan out into the past into sources that are ultimately very unlike the entity which I now am.
After only eighteen years of non-interference, there were already indications of melioration, though in a slight degree, to be sure.
There were more indications by the mid-twentieth century.
I leave it to the statisticians to say what they were, but I noticed several a few years ago, during an automobile ride from Memphis to Hattiesburg.
In town after town my companion pointed out the Negro school and the White school, and in every instance the former made a better appearance ( it was newer, for one thing ).
It really looked as if a change of the sort predicted by Booker T. Washington had been going on.
But with the renewal of interference in 1954 ( as with its beginning in 1835 ), the improvement was impaired.
For over a hundred years Southerners have felt that the North was picking on them.
It's infuriating, this feeling that one is being picked on, continually, constantly.
By what right of superior virtue, Southerners ask, do the people of the North do this?
The traditional strategy of the South has been to expose the vices of the North, to demonstrate that the North possessed no superior virtue, to show the world that as James's Christopher Newman said to his adversaries ) however bad I may be, you're not quite the people to say it.
In the pre-*civil War years, the South argued that the slave was not less humanely treated than the factory worker of the North.
At the present time, the counter-attack takes the line that there's no more of the true spirit of integration in the North than in the South.
The line is a pretty good one.
People talk about the law of the land.
The expression has become quite a cliche.
But people can't be made to integrate, socialize ( the two are inseparable by Southern standards ) by law.
I was having lunch not long ago ( apologies to N. V. Peale ) with three distinguished historians ( one specializing in the European Middle Ages, one in American history, and one in the Far East ), and I asked them if they could name instances where the general mores had been radically changed with deliberate speed, majestic instancy ( Francis Thompson's words for the Hound Of Heaven's Pursuit ) by judicial fiat.
They didn't seem to be able to think of any.
A Virginia judge a while back cited a Roman jurist to the effect that ten years might be a reasonable length of time for such a change.
But I suspect that the old Roman was referring to change made under military occupation -- the sort of change which Tacitus was talking about when he said, they make a desert, and call it peace ( solitudinem faciunt, pacem appellant.
).
Moreover, the law of the land is not irrevocable ; it can be changed ; it has been, many times.
Mr. Justice Taney's Dred Scott decision in 1857 was unpopular in the North, and soon became a dead letter.
Prohibition was the law of the land, but it was unpopular ( how many of us oldsters took up drinking in prohibition days, drinking was so gay, so fashionable, especially in the sophisticated Northeast ] ) and was repealed.
The cliche loses its talismanic virtue in the light of a little history.
The Declaration of Independence says that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.
The phrase consent of the governed needs a hard look.
How do we define it?
Is the consent of the governed a numerical majority?
Calhoun dealt with this question in his Disquisition On Government.
To guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority, Calhoun developed his theory of concurrent majority, which, he said, by giving to each portion of the community which may be unequally affected by the action of government, a negative on the others, prevents all partial or local legislation.
Who will say that our country is even now a homogeneous community?
That regional peculiarities do not still exist?
That the Court order does not unequally affect the Southern region?
Who will deny that in a vast portion of the South the Federal action is incompatible with the Jeffersonian concept of the consent of the governed?
Circumstances alter cases.
A friend of mine in New Mexico said the Court order had caused no particular trouble out there, that all had gone as merry as a marriage bell.
He seemed a little surprised that it should have caused any particular trouble anywhere.
I murmured something about a possible difference between New Mexico's history and Mississippi's.
One can meet with aloofness almost anywhere : the T*h*i*d*i*u viewpoint, It Doesn't Affect Us ] Southern Liberals ( there are a good many ) -- especially if they're rich -- often exhibit blithe insouciance.
The trouble here is that it's almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it doesn't cost you anything.
You've already sent your daughter to Miss *j select academy for girls and your son to Mr. *j select academy for boys, and you can be as liberal as you please with strict impunity.
If there's no suitable academy in your own neighborhood, there's always New England.
New England academies welcome fugitives from the provinces, South as well as West.
They may even enroll a colored student or two for show, though he usually turns out to be from Thailand, or any place other than the American South.
It would be interesting to know how much integration there is in the famous, fashionable colleges and prep schools of New England.
A recent newspaper report said there were five Negroes in the 1960 graduating class of nearly one thousand at Yale ; that is, about one-half of one per cent, which looks pretty tokenish to me, especially in an institution which professes to be national.
I must confess that I prefer the Liberal who is personally affected, who is willing to send his own children to a mixed school as proof of his faith.
I leave out of account the question of the best interests of the children, the question of what their best interests really are.
I'm talking about the grand manner of the Liberal -- North and South -- who is not affected personally.
If these people were denied a voice ( do they have a moral right to a voice?
), what voices would be left?
Who is involved willy nilly?
Well, after everybody has followed the New England pattern of segregating one's children into private schools, only the poor folks are left.
And it is precisely in this poorer economic class that one finds, and has always found, the most racial friction.
A dear, respected friend of mine, who like myself grew up in the South and has spent many years in New England, said to me not long ago : I can't forgive New England for rejecting all complicity.
Being a teacher of American literature, I remembered Whittier's Massachusetts To Virginia, where he said : but that one dark loathsome burden ye must stagger with alone, and reap the bitter harvest which ye yourselves have sown.
There is a legend ( Hawthorne records it in his English Notebooks.
And one finds it again in Thomas Nelson Page ) to the effect that the Mayflower on its second voyage brought a cargo of Negro slaves.
Whether historically a fact or not, the legend has a certain symbolic value.
Complicity is an embarrassing word.
It is something which most of us try to get out from under.
Like the cowboy in Stephen Crane's Blue Hotel, we run around crying, well, I didn't do anything, did I?
Robert Penn Warren puts it this way in Brother To Dragons : the recognition of complicity is the beginning of innocence, where innocence, I think, means about the same thing as redemption.
A man must be able to say, Father, I have sinned, or there is no hope for him.
Lincoln understood this better than most when he said in his Second Inaugural that God gives to both North and South this terrible war, as the woe due to those by whom the offense came.
He also spoke of the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years in unrequited toil.
Lincoln was historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth had accumulated in the hands of the descendants of New Englanders engaged in the slave trade.
After how many generations is such wealth ( mounting all the while through the manipulations of high finance ) purified of taint?
It is a question which New Englanders long ago put out of their minds.
But didn't they get off too easy?
The slaves never shared in their profits, while they did share, in a very real sense, in the profits of the slave-owners : they were fed, clothed, doctored, and so forth ; they were the beneficiaries of responsible, paternalistic care.
Emerson -- Platonist, idealist, doctrinaire -- sounded a high Transcendental note in his Boston Hymn, delivered in 1863 in the Boston Music Hall amidst thundering applause : pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim.
Who is the owner?
The slave is owner, and ever was.
Pay him ] it is the abstractionism, the unrealism, of the pure idealist.
It ignores the sordid financial aspects ( quite conveniently, too, for his audience, who could indulge in moral indignation without visible, or even conscious, discomfort, their money from the transaction having been put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage ).
Like Pilate, they had washed their hands.
But can one, really?
Can God be mocked, ever, in the long run?
New Englanders were a bit sensitive on the subject of their complicity in Negro slavery at the time of the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, as Jefferson explained in his Autobiography : the clause reprobating the enslaving the inhabitants of Africa was struck out in complaisance to South Carolina and Georgia, who had never attempted to restrain the importation of slaves, and who on the contrary still wished to continue it.
Our Northern brethren also I believe felt a little tender under those censures ; for though their people had very few slaves themselves, yet they had been pretty considerable carriers of them to others.
But that was a long time ago.
The New England conscience became desensitized.
George W. Cable ( naturalized New Englander ), writing in 1889 from Paradise Road, Northampton ( lovely symbolic name ), agitated continuously the Southern question.
It was nice to be able to isolate it.
New England, as everyone knows, has long been schoolmaster to the Nation.
There one finds concentrated in a comparatively small area the chief universities, colleges, and preparatory schools of the United States.
Why should this be so?
It is true that New England, more than any other section, was dedicated to education from the start.
But I think that something more than this is involved.
How did it happen, for example, that the state university, that great symbol of American democracy, failed to flourish in New England as it did in other parts of the country?
Isn't it a bit odd that the three states of Southern New England ( Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island ) have had state institutions of university status only in the very recent past, these institutions having previously been *j & *j colleges?
Was it supposed, perchance, that *j & *j ( vocational training, that is ) was quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flooded that part of the New England world in the post-*civil War period, the immigrants having been brought in from Southern Europe, to work in the mills, to make up for the labor shortage caused by migration to the West?
Is it not ironical that Roger Williams's state, Rhode Island, should have been the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university?
The state universities of Maine, New Hampshire, And Vermont are older and more respectable ; they had less immigration to contend with.
A Yale historian, writing a few years ago in the Yale Review, said : we in New England have long since segregated our children.
He was referring not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory schools.
And what a galaxy of those adorns that fair land ] I don't propose to go into their history, but I have one or two surmises.
One is that they were established, or gained eminence, under pressure provided by these same immigrants, from whom the old families wished to segregate their children.
In the early days of a homogeneous population, the public school was quite satisfactory.
Among the recipients of the Nobel Prize for Literature more than half are practically unknown to readers of English.
Of these there are surely few that would be more rewarding discoveries than Verner Von Heidenstam, the Swedish poet and novelist who received the award in 1916 and whose centennial was celebrated two years ago.
Equally a master of prose and verse, he recreates the glory of Sweden in the past and continues it into the present.
In the following sketch we shall present a brief outline of his life and let him as much as possible speak for himself.
Heidenstam was born in 1859, of a prosperous family.
On his father's side he was of German descent, on his mother's he came of the old Swedish nobility.
The family estate was situated near Vadstena on Lake Vattern in south central Sweden.
It is a lonely, rather desolate region, but full of legendary and historic associations.
As a boy in a local school he was shy and solitary, absorbed in his fondness for nature and his visions of Sweden's ancient glory.
He liked to fancy himself as a chieftain and to dress for the part.
Being somewhat delicate in health, at the age of sixteen he was sent to Southern Europe, for which he at once developed a passion, so that he spent nearly all of the following ten years abroad, at first in Italy, then in Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, and Palestine.
In one of his summers at home he married, to the great disapproval of his father, who objected because of his extreme youth.
Deciding to become a painter, he entered the studio of Gerome in Paris, where he enjoyed the life of the artists, but soon found that whatever talent he might have did not lie in that direction.
He gives us an account of this in his lively and humorous poem, The Happy Artists.
I scanned the world through printed symbol swart, and through the beggar's rags I strove to see the inner man.
I looked unceasingly with my cold mind and with my burning heart.
In this final line, we have the key to his nature.
Few writers have better understood their deepest selves.
Heidenstam could never be satisfied by surface.
It may, however, be noted that his gift for color and imagery must have been greatly stimulated by his stay in Paris.
The first result of Heidenstam's long sojourn abroad was a volume of poems, Pilgrimage And Wander-*years ( Vallfart och Vandringsar ), published in 1888.
It was a brilliant debut, so much so indeed that it aroused a new vitality in the younger poets, as did Byron's Childe Harold.
Professor Fredrik Book, Sweden's foremost critic of the period, acclaims it as follows : in this we have the verse of a painter ; strongly colorful, plastic, racy, vivid.
In a bold, sometimes careless, form there is nothing academic ; all is seen and felt and experienced, the observation is sharp and the imagination lively.
The young poet-painter reproduces the French life of the streets ; he tells stories of the Thousand and One Nights, and conjures up before us the bazaars of Damascus.
In the care-free indolence of the East he sees the last reflection of the old happy existence, and for that reason he loves it.
And yet amid all the gay hedonism in Pilgrimage And Wander-*years is a cycle of short poems, Thoughts In Loneliness, filled with brooding, melancholy, and sombre longing.
Of the longer pieces of the volume none is so memorable as Nameless And Immortal, which at once took rank among the finest poems ever written in the Swedish language.
It celebrates the unknown architect who designed the temple of Neptune at Paestum, next to the Parthenon the noblest example of Grecian classic style now in existence.
On the eve of his return to their native Naxos he speaks with his wife of the masterpiece which rises before them in its completed perfection.
The supreme object of their lives is now fulfilled, says the wife, her husband has achieved immortality.
Not so, he answers, it is not the architect but the temple that is immortal.
The man's true reputation is his work.
The short poems grouped at the end of the volume as Thoughts in Loneliness is, as Professor Book indicated, in sharp contrast with the others.
It consists of fragmentary personal revelations, such as The Spark : there is a spark dwells deep within my soul.
To get it out into the daylight's glow is my life's aim both first and last, the whole.
It slips away, it burns and tortures me.
That little spark is all the wealth I know, that little spark is my life's misery.
A dominant motive is the poet's longing for his homeland and its boyhood associations : not men-folk, but the fields where I would stray, the stones where as a child I used to play.
He is utterly disappointed in himself and in the desultory life he has been leading.
What he really wants is to find a sacred cause to which he can honestly devote himself.
This restless individualism found its answer when he returned to live nearly all the rest of his life in Sweden.
His cause was to commemorate the glory of her past and to incite her people to perpetuate it in the present.
He did not, however, find himself at once.
His next major work, completed in 1892, was a long fantastic epic in prose, entitled Hans Alienus, which Professor Book describes as a monument on the grave of his carefree and indolent youth.
The hero, who is himself, is represented as a pilgrim in the storied lands of the East, a sort of Faustus type, who, to quote from Professor Book again, even in the pleasure gardens of Sardanapalus can not cease from his painful search after the meaning of life.
He is driven back by his yearning to the wintry homeland of his fathers in the forest of Tiveden.
From this time on Heidenstam proceeded to find his deeper self.
By the death of his father in 1888 he had come into possession of the family estate and had re-assumed its traditions.
He did not, however, settle back into acquiescence with things as they were.
Like his friend and contemporary August Strindberg he had little patience with collective mediocrity.
He saw Sweden as a country of smug and narrow provincialism, indifferent to the heroic spirit of its former glory.
Strindberg's remedy for this condition was to tear down the old structures and build anew from the ground up.
Heidenstam's conception, on the contrary, was to revive the present by the memories of the past.
Whether in prose or poetry, all of Heidenstam's later work was concerned with Sweden.
With the first of a group of historical novels, the Charles Men ( Karolinerna ), published in 1897-8, he achieved the masterpiece of his career.
In scope and power it can only be compared to Tolstoy's War And Peace.
About one-third as long, it is less intimate and detailed, but better coordinated, more concise and more dramatic.
Though it centers around the brilliant and enigmatic figure of Charles 12, the true hero is not finally the king himself.
Hence the title of the book, referring to the soldiers and subjects of the king ; on the fatal battlefield of Poltava, to quote from the novel, the wreath he twined for himself slipped down upon his people.
The Charles Men consists not of a connected narrative but of a group of short stories, each depicting a special phase of the general subject.
Somewhat uneven in interest for an average reader, eight or ten of these are among the finest of their kind in literature.
They comprise a great variety of scene and interest : grim episodes of war, idyllic interludes, superb canvases of world-shaking events, and delightfully humorous sketches of odd characters.
The general effect is tragic.
Almost nothing is said of Charles' spectacular victories, the central theme being the heroic loyalty of the Swedish people to their idolized king in misfortune and defeat.
To carry out this exalted conception the author has combined the vivid realism and imaginative power we have noticed in his early poetry and carried them out on a grand scale.
His peculiar gift, as had been suggested before, is his intensity.
George Meredith has said that fervor is the core of style.
Of few authors is this more true than of Heidenstam.
The Charles Men has a tremendous range of characters, of common folk even more than of major figures.
The career of Charles 12 is obviously very similar to that of Napoleon.
His ideal was Alexander of Macedon, as Napoleon's was Julius Caesar.
His purpose, however, was not to establish an empire, but to assert the principle of divine justice.
Each aspired to be a god in human form, but with each it was a different kind of god.
Each failed catastrophically in an invasion of Russia and each brought ruin on the country that worshipped him.
Each is still glorified as a national hero.
The first half of The Charles Men, ending on the climax of the battle of Poltava in 1709, is more dramatically coherent than the second.
After the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerated for a time into a futility that was not merely pitiable but often ridiculous.
Like Napoleon, he was the worst of losers.
There are, however, some wonderful chapters at the beginning of the second part, concerning the reactions of the Swedes in adversity.
Then more than ever before did they show their fortitude and patient cheerfulness.
This comes out in When The Bells Ring, which describes the rallying of the peasants in southern Sweden to repel an invasion by the Danes.
In The King's Ride, Charles breaks out of a long period of petulance and inertia, regains his old self, escapes from Turkey, and finally reaches his own land after an absence of eighteen years.
He finds it in utter misery and desolation.
All his people ask for is no more war.
But he plunges into yet another, this time with Norway, and is killed in an assault on the fortress of Fredrikshall, being only thirty-six years of age when he died.
He had become king at fifteen.
Then suddenly there was a tremendous revulsion of popular feeling.
From being a hated tyrant and madman he was now the symbol of all that was noblest and best in the history of Sweden.
This is brought out in the next to last chapter of the book, A Hero's Funeral, written in the form of an impassioned prose poem.
Slowly the procession of warriors and statesmen passes through the snow beside the black water and into the brilliantly lighted cathedral, the shrine of so many precious memories.
The guns are fired, the hymns are sung, and the body of Charles is carried down to the vault and laid beside the tombs of his ancestors.
As he had longed to be, he became the echo of a saga.
Heidenstam wrote four other works of fiction about earlier figures revered in Swedish memory.
Excellent in their way, they lack the wide appeal of The Charles Men, and need not detain us here.
It is different with his volume The Swedes And Their Chieftains ( Svenskarna och deras Hovdingar ), a history intended for the general reader and particularly suited for high school students.
Admirably written, it is a perfect introduction to Swedish history for readers of other countries.
Some of the earlier episodes have touches of the supernatural, as suited to the legendary background.
These are suggestive of Selma Lagerlof.
Especially touching is the chapter, The Little Sister, about a king's daughter who became a nun in the convent of St. Birgitta.
The record teems with romance and adventure.
Gustaf Vasa is a superb example, and Charles 10, the conqueror of Denmark, hardly less so.
Of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles 12 it is unnecessary to speak.
Today the private detective will also investigate insurance claims or handle divorce cases, but his primary function remains what it has always been, to assist those who have money in their unending struggle with those who have not.
It is from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective was recruited.
The mythological private eye differs from his counterpart in real life in two essential ways.
On the one hand, he does not work for a large agency, but is almost always self-employed.
As a free-lance investigator, the fictional detective is responsible to no one but himself and his client.
For this reason, he appears as an independent and self-reliant figure, whose rugged individualism need not be pressed into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine.
On the other hand, the fictional detective does not break strikes or handle divorce cases ; no client would ever think of asking him to do such things.
Whatever his original assignment, the fictional private eye ends up by investigating and solving a crime, usually a murder.
Operating as a one man police force in fact if not in name, he is at once more independent and more dedicated than the police themselves.
He catches criminals not merely because he is paid to do so ( frequently he does not receive a fee at all ), but because he enjoys his work, because he firmly believes that murder must be punished.
Thus the fictional detective is much more than a simple businessman.
He is, first and foremost, a defender of public morals, a servant of society.
It is this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which accounts for the great appeal of the mythological detective.
By virtue of his self-reliance, his individualism and his freedom from external restraint, the private eye is a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty, which amounts to doing what you please and let the devil take the hindmost.
At the same time, because the personal code of the detective coincides with the legal dictates of his society, because he likes to catch criminals, he is in middle class eyes a virtuous man.
In this way, the private detective gets the best of two possible worlds.
He is an individualist but not an anarchist ; he is a public servant but not a cop.
In short, the fictional private eye is a specialized version of Adam Smith's ideal entrepreneur, the man whose private ambitions must always and everywhere promote the public welfare.
In the mystery story, as in The Wealth of Nations, individualism and the social good are two sides of the same benevolent coin.
There is only one catch to this idyllic arrangement : Adam Smith was wrong.
Not only did the ideal entrepreneur not produce the greatest good for the greatest number, he ended by destroying himself, by giving birth to monopoly capitalism.
The rise of the giant corporations in Western Europe and the United States dates from the period 1880-1900.
Now, although the roots of the mystery story in serious literature go back as far as Balzac, Dickens, and Poe, it was not until the closing decades of the 19th century that the private detective became an established figure in popular fiction.
Sherlock Holmes, the ancestor of all private eyes, was born during the 1890s.
Thus the transformation of Adam Smith's ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincides closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life.
Driven from the marketplace by the course of history, our hero disguises himself as a private detective.
The birth of the myth compensates for the death of the ideal.
Even on the fictional level, however, the contradictions which give rise to the mystery story are not fully resolved.
The individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from his dedication to a personal code of conduct : he enforces the law without being told to do so.
The private eye is therefore a moral man ; but his morality rests upon that of his society.
The basic premise of all mystery stories is that the distinction between good and bad coincides with the distinction between legal and illegal.
Unfortunately, this assumption does not always hold good.
As capitalism in the 20th century has become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for its survival, the private detective is placed in a serious dilemma.
If he is good, he may not be legal ; if he is legal, he may not be good.
It is the gradual unfolding and deepening of this contradiction which creates the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story.
With the advent of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, the development of the modern private detective begins.
Sherlock Holmes is not merely an individualist ; he is very close to being a mental case.
A brief list of the great detective's little idiosyncrasies would provide Dr. Freud with ample food for thought.
Holmes is addicted to the use of cocaine and other refreshing stimulants ; he is prone to semi-catatonic trances induced by the playing of the vioiln ; he is a recluse, an incredible egotist, a confirmed misogynist.
Holmes rebels against the social conventions of his day not on moral but rather on aesthetic grounds.
His eccentricity begins as a defense against boredom.
It was in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that Holmes became a detective in the first place.
As he informs Watson, my life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence.
These little problems help me to do so.
Holmes is a public servant, to be sure ; but the society which he serves bores him to tears.
The curious relationship between Holmes and Scotland Yard provides an important clue to the deeper significance of his eccentric behavior.
Although he is perfectly willing to cooperate with Scotland Yard, Holmes has nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police.
They for their part are convinced that Holmes is too unorthodox and theoretical to make a good detective.
Why do the police find Holmes unorthodox?
On the face of it, it is because he employs deductive techniques alien to official police routine.
Another, more interesting explanation, is hinted at by Watson when he observes on several occasions that Holmes would have made a magnificent criminal.
The great detective modestly agrees.
Watson's insight is verified by the mysterious link between Holmes and his arch-opponent, Dr. Moriarty.
The two men resemble each other closely in their cunning, their egotism, their relentlessness.
The first series of Sherlock Holmes adventures ends with Holmes and Moriarty grappling together on the edge of a cliff.
They are presumed to have plunged to a common grave in this fatal embrace.
Linked to Holmes even in death, Moriarty represents the alter-ego of the great detective, the image of what our hero might have become were he not a public servant.
Just as Holmes the eccentric stands behind Holmes the detective, so Holmes the potential criminal lurks behind both.
In the modern English whodunnit, this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself has almost entirely disappeared.
Hercule Poirot and Lord Peter Whimsey ( the respective creations of Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers ) have retained Holmes' egotism but not his zest for life and eccentric habits.
Poirot and his counterparts are perfectly respectable people ; it is true that they are also extremely dull.
Their dedication to the status quo has been affirmed at the expense of the fascinating but dangerous individualism of a Sherlock Holmes.
The latter's real descendents were unable to take root in England ; they fled from the Victorian parlor and made their way across the stormy Atlantic.
In the American hardboiled detective story of the '20s and '30s, the spirit of the mad genius from Baker Street lives on.
Like Holmes, the American private eye rejects the social conventions of his time.
But unlike Holmes, he feels his society to be not merely dull but also corrupt.
Surrounded by crime and violence everywhere, the hardboiled private eye can retain his purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation.
His alienation is far more acute than Holmes' ; he is not an eccentric but rather an outcast.
With Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe, alienation is represented on a purely physical plane.
Wolfe refuses to ever leave his own house, and spends most of his time drinking beer and playing with orchids.
More profound and more disturbing, however, is the moral isolation of Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe.
In a society where everything is for sale, Marlowe is the only man who cannot be bought.
His tough honesty condemns him to a solitary and difficult existence.
Beaten, bruised and exhausted, he pursues the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low morals, always alone, always despised.
In the end, he gets his man, but no one seems to care ; virtue is its own and only reward.
A similar tone of underlying futility and despair pervades the spy thrillers of Eric Ambler and dominates the most famous of all American mystery stories, Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon.
Sam Spade joins forces with a band of adventurers in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon ; but when the bird is found at last, it turns out to be a fake.
Now the detective must save his own skin by informing on the girl he loves, who is also the real murderer.
For Sam Spade, neither crime nor virtue pays ; moreover, it is increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two.
Because the private eye intends to save society in spite of himself, he invariably finds himself in trouble with the police.
The latter are either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care.
In either case, they do not appreciate the private detective's zeal.
Perry Mason and Hamilton Burger, Nero Wolfe and Inspector Cramer spend more time fighting each other than they do in looking for the criminal.
Frequently enough, the police are themselves in league with the killer ; Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest provides a classic example of this theme.
But even when the police are honest, they do not trust the private eye.
He is, like Phillip Marlowe, too alienated to be reliable.
Finally, in the Maltese Falcon among others, the clash between detective and police is carried to its logical conclusion : Sam Spade becomes the chief murder suspect.
In order to exonerate himself, he is compelled to find the real criminal, who happens to be his girl friend.
What was only a vague suspicion in the case of Sherlock Holmes now appears as a direct accusation : the private eye is in danger of turning into his opposite.
It is the growing contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which creates this fatal dilemma.
By upholding his own personal code of behavior, the private detective has placed himself in opposition to a society whose fabric is permeated with crime and corruption.
That society responds by condemning the private eye as a threat to the status quo, a potential criminal.
If the detective insists upon retaining his personal standards, he must now do so in conscious defiance of his society.
He must, in short, cease to be a detective and become a rebel.
On the other hand, if he wishes to continue in his chosen profession, he must abandon his own code and sacrifice his precious individualism.
Dashiell Hammett resolved this contradiction by ceasing to write mystery stories and turning to other pursuits.
His successors have adopted the opposite alternative.
In order to save the mystery story, they have converted the private detective into an organization man.
The first of two possible variations on this theme is symbolized by Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer.
At first glance, this hero seems to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of his predecessors.
For Hammer, nothing is forbidden.
He kills when he pleases, takes his women where he finds them and always acts as judge, jury and executioner rolled into one.
It will be shown that the objectives of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network required, because the type of network functions according to the characteristics of the messages enumerated in Table 1.
Great stress is placed on the role that the monitoring of information sending plays in maintaining the effectiveness of the network.
By monitoring, we mean some system of control over the types of information sent from the various centers.
As a word of caution, we should be aware that in actual practice no message is purely one of the four types, question, command, statement, or exclamation.
For example, suppose a man wearing a $200 watch, driving a 1959 Rolls Royce, stops to ask a man on the sidewalk, what time is it?
This sentence would have most of the characteristics of a question, but it has some of the characteristics of a statement because the questioner has conveyed the fact that he has no faith in his own timepiece or the one attached to his car.
If the man on the sidewalk is surprised at this question, it has served as an exclamation.
Also, since the man questioned feels a strong compulsion to answer ( and thereby avoid the consequences of being thought queer ) the question has assumed some measurable properties of a command.
However, for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classified according to Table 1.
On this basis, certain extreme kinds of networks will be discussed for illustrative purposes.
Networks illustrating some special types of organization the cocktail party.
Presumably a cocktail party is expected to fulfill the host's desire to get together a number of people who are inadequately acquainted and thereby arrange for bringing the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavors.
The party is usually in a room small enough so that all guests are within sight and hearing of one another.
The information is furnished by each of the guests, is sent by oral broadcasting over the air waves, and is received by the ears.
Since the air is a continuum, the network of communication remains intact regardless of the positions or motions of the points ( the people ) in the net.
As shown in Figure 1, there is a connection for communication between every pair of points.
This, and other qualifications, make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dreamed up.
All four types of message listed in Table 1 are permitted, although decorum and cocktail tradition require holding the commands to a minimum, while exclamations having complimentary intonations are more than customarily encouraged.
The completeness of the connections provide that, for *j people, there are *f lines of communication between the pairs, which can become a large number ( 1,225 ) for a party of fifty guests.
Looking at the diagram, we see that *f connection lines come in to each member.
Thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system, but there is one weakness.
In spite of the dreams of the host for oneness in the group, the *f incoming messages for each guest overload his receiving system beyond comprehension if *j exceeds about six.
The crowd consequently breaks up into temporary groups ranging in size from two to six, with a half-life for the cluster ranging from three to twenty minutes.
For the occasion on which everyone already knows everyone else and the host wishes them to meet one or a few honored newcomers, then the open house system is advantageous because the honored guests are fixed connective points and the drifting guests make and break connections at the door.
The rural community.
We consider a rural community as an assemblage of inhabited dwellings whose configuration is determined by the location and size of the arable land sites necessary for family subsistence.
We assume for this illustration that the size of the land plots is so great that the distance between dwellings is greater than the voice can carry and that most of the communication is between nearest neighbors only, as shown in Figure 2.
Information beyond nearest neighbor is carried second-, third-, and fourth-hand as a distortable rumor.
In Figure 2, the points in the network are designated by a letter accompanied by a number.
The numbers indicate the number of nearest neighbors.
It will be noted that point *j has seven nearest neighbors, *j and *j have six, and *j has only one, while the remaining points have intermediate numbers.
In any social system in which communications have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factors, a point like *j in Figure 2 would ( other things being equal ) be the dwelling place for the community leader, while *j and *j would house the next most important citizens.
A point like *j gets information directly from *j, but all information beyond *j is indirectly relayed through *j.
The dweller at *j is last to hear about a new cure, the slowest to announce to his neighbors his urgent distresses, the one who goes the farthest to trade, and the one with the greatest difficulty of all in putting over an idea or getting people to join him in a cooperative effort.
Since the hazards of poor communication are so great, *j can be justified as a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such as is made available by a waterfall for milling purposes, a mine, or a sugar maple camp.
Location theorists have given these matters much consideration.
Military organizations.
The networks for military communications are one of the best examples of networks which not only must be changed with the changes in objectives but also must be changed with the addition of new machines of war.
They also furnish proof that, in modern war, message sending must be monitored.
Without monitoring, a military hookup becomes a noisy party.
The need for monitoring became greater when radio was adopted for military signaling.
Alexander the Great, who used runners as message carriers, did not have to worry about having every officer in his command hear what he said and having hundreds of them comment at once.
As time has passed and science has progressed, the speed of military vehicles has increased, the range of missiles has been extended, the use of target-hunting noses on the projectiles has been adopted, and the range and breadth of message sending has increased.
Next to the old problem of the slowness of decision making, network structure seems to be paramount, and without monitoring no network has value.
On the parade ground the net may be similar to that shown in Figure 3.
The monitoring is the highest and most restrictive of any organization in existence.
No questions, statements, or explanations are permitted -- only commands.
Commands go only from an officer to the man of nearest lower rank.
The same command is repeated as many times as there are levels in rank from general to corporal.
All orders originate with the officer of highest rank and terminate with action of the men in the ranks.
Even the officer in charge, be it a captain ( for small display ) or a general, is restrained by monitoring.
This is done for simplicity of commands and to bring the hidden redundancy up to where misunderstanding has almost zero possibility.
The commands are specified by the military regulations ; are few in number, briefly worded, all different in sound ; and are combinable into sequences which permit any marching maneuver that could be desired on a parade ground.
This monitoring is necessary because, on a parade ground, everyone can hear too much, and without monitoring a confused social event would develop.
With troops dispersed on fields of battle rather than on the parade ground, it may seem that a certain amount of monitoring is automatically enforced by the lines of communication.
Years ago this was true, but with the replacement of wires or runners by radio and radar ( and perhaps television ), these restrictions have disappeared and now again too much is heard.
In contrast to cocktail parties, military organizations, even in the field, are more formal.
In the extreme and oversimplified example suggested in Figure 3, the organization is more easily understood and more predictable in behavior.
A military organization has an objective chosen by the higher command.
This objective is adhered to throughout the duration of the action.
The connective system, or network, is tailored to meet the requirements of the objective, and it is therefore not surprising that a military body acting as a single coordinated unit has a different communication network than a factory, a college, or a rural village.
The assumptions upon which the example shown in Figure 3 is based are : ( A ) one man can direct about six subordinates if the subordinates are chosen carefully so that they do not need too much personal coaching, indoctrinating, etc..
( B ) a message runs too great a risk of being distorted if it is to be relayed more than about six consecutive times.
( C ) decisions of a general kind are made by the central command.
And ( D ) all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission is relegated to the line of men on the lower rank.
These assumptions lead to an organization with one man at the top, six directly under him, six under each of these, and so on until there are six levels of personnel.
The number of people acting as one body by this scheme gives a surprisingly large army of 55,987 men.
This organizational network would be of no avail if there were no regulations pertaining to the types of message sent.
Of types of message listed in Table 1, commands and statements are the only ones sent through the vertical network shown in Figure 3.
A further regulation is that commands always go down, unaccompanied by statements, and statements always go up, unaccompanied by commands.
Questions and, particularly, exclamations are usually channeled along informal, horizontal lines not indicated in Figure 3 and seldom are carried beyond the nearest neighbor.
It will readily be seen that in this suggested network ( not materially different from some of the networks in vogue today ) greater emphasis on monitoring is implied than is usually put into practice.
Furthermore, the network in Figure 3 is only the basic net through which other networks pertaining to logistics and the like are interlaced.
Not discussed here are some military problems of modern times such as undersea warfare, where the surveillance, sending, transmitting, and receiving are all so inadequate that networks and decision making are not the bottlenecks.
Such problems are of extreme interest as well as importance and are so much like fighting in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflicts for what they could teach.
A team for useful research.
This is an unsolved problem which probably has never been seriously investigated, although one frequently hears the comment that we have insufficient specialists of the kind who can compete with the Germans or Swiss, for example, in precision machinery and mathematics, or the Finns in geochemistry.
We hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalists who can see the over-all picture and combine our national skills and knowledge for useful purposes.
This problem of the optimum balance in the relative numbers of generalists and specialists can be investigated on a communicative network basis.
Since the difficulty of drawing the net is great, we will merely discuss it.
First, we realize that a pure specialist does not exist.
But, for practical purposes, we have people who can be considered as such.
For example, there are persons who are in physical science, in the field of mineralogy, trained in crystallography, who use only X-rays, applying only the powder technique of X-ray diffraction, to clay minerals only, and who have spent the last fifteen years concentrating on the montmorillonites ; or persons in the social sciences in the field of anthropology, studying the lung capacity of seven Andean Indians.
So we see that a specialist is a man who knows more and more about less and less as he develops, as contrasted to the generalist, who knows less and less about more and more.
American democratic thought pointed up the relation between the Protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion, which he called the American Democratic Faith.
Those familiar with his work will remember that he placed the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850.
And he describes it as a balanced polarity between the notions of the free individual and what he called the fundamental law.
I want to say more about Gabriel's so-called fundamental law.
But first I want to quote him on the relationship that he found between religion and politics in this country and what happened to it.
He points out that from the time of Jackson on through World War 1, evangelical Protestantism was a dominant influence in the social and political life of America.
He terms this early enthusiasm Romantic Christianity and concludes that its similarity to democratic beliefs of that day is so great that the doctrine of liberty seems but a secular version of its counterpart in evangelical Protestantism.
Let me quote him even more fully, for his analysis is important to my theme.
He says : beside the Protestant philosophy of Progress, as expressed in radical or conservative millenarianism, should be placed the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirmed it to be the duty of the destiny of the United States to assist in the creation of a better world by keeping lighted the beacon of democracy.
He specifies, in the middle period of the Nineteenth Century it was colored by Christian supernaturalism, in the Twentieth Century it was affected by naturalism.
But in every period it has been humanism.
And let me add, utopianism, also.
Some fourteen or fifteen years ago, in an essay I called The Leader Follows -- Where?
I used his polarity to illustrate what I thought had happened to us in that form of liberalism we call Progressivism.
It seemed to me that the liberals had scrapped the balanced polarity and reposed both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man.
That is to say Gabriel's fundamental law had been so much modified by this time that it was neither fundamental nor law any more.
It is a weakness of Gabriel's analysis that he never seems to realize that his so-called fundamental law had already been cut loose from its foundations when it was adapted to democracy.
And with Progressivism the Religion of Humanity was replacing what Gabriel called Christian supernaturalism.
And the common man was developing mythic power, or charisma, on his own.
During the decade that followed, the common man, as that piece put it, grew uncomfortable as the Voice of God and fled from behind Saint Woodrow ( Wilson ) only to learn from Science, to his shocked relief that after all there was no God he had to speak for and that he was just an animal anyhow -- that there was a chemical formula for him, and that too much couldn't be expected of him.
The socialism implicit in the slogan of the Roosevelt Revolution, freedom from want and fear, seems a far cry from the individualism of the First Amendment to the Constitution, or of the Jacksonian frontier.
What had happened to the common man?
French Egalitarianism had had only nominal influence in this country before the days of Popularism.
The riotous onrush of industrialism after the War for Southern Independence and the general secular drift to the Religion of Humanity, however, prepared the way for a reception of the French Revolution's socialistic offspring of one sort of another.
The first of which to find important place in our federal government was the graduated income tax under Wilson.
Moreover the centralization of our economy during the 1920s, the dislocations of the Depression, the common ethos of Materialism everywhere, all contributed in various ways to the face-lifting that replaced Mike Fink and the Great Gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the Little People.
However, it is important to trace the philosophy of the French Revolution to its sources to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former.
That John Locke's philosophy of the social contract fathered the American Revolution with its Declaration of Independence, I believe, we generally accept.
Yet, after Rousseau had given the social contract a new twist with his notion of the General Will, the same philosophy, it may be said, became the idea source of the French Revolution also.
The importance of Rousseau's twist has not always been clear to us, however.
This notion of the General Will gave rise to the Commune of Paris in the Revolution and later brought Napoleon to dictatorship.
And it is clearly argued by Lord Percy of Newcastle, in his remarkable long essay, The Heresy Of Democracy, and in a more general way by Voegelin, in his New Science Of Politics, that this same Rousseauan idea, descending through European democracy, is the source of Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.
This is important to understanding the position that doctrinaire liberals found themselves in after World War 2 and our great democratic victory that brought no peace.
The long road that had taken liberals in this country into the social religion of democracy, into a worship of man, led logically to the Marxist dream of a classless society under a Socialist State.
And the *j existed as the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism, the ultimate exemplar.
And by the time the war ended, liberal leadership in this country was spiritually Marxist.
We will recall that the still confident liberals of the Truman administration gathered with other Western utopians in San Francisco to set up the legal framework, finally and at last, to rationalize war -- to rationalize want and fear -- out of the world : the United Nations.
We of the liberal-led world got all set for peace and rehabilitation.
Then suddenly we found ourselves in the middle of another fight, an irrational, an indecent, an undeclared and immoral war with our strongest ( and some had thought noblest ) ally.
During the next five years the leaders of the Fair Deal reluctantly backed down from the optimistic expectations of the New Deal.
During the next five years liberal leaders in the United States sank in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifested in a negative policy of Containment -- and the bitterest irony -- enforced and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we felt the greatest distaste for but could not abandon : the atom bomb.
In 1952, it will be remembered, the G.*o.*p. without positive program campaigned on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and won overwhelmingly.
All of this, I know, is recent history familiar to you.
But I have been at some pains to review it as the drama of the common man, to point up what happened to him under Eisenhower's leadership.
A perceptive journalist, Sam Lubell, has phrased it in the title of one of his books as the revolt of the moderates.
He opens his discourse, however, with a review of the Eisenhower inaugural festivities at which a sympathetic press had assembled its massive talents, all primed to catch some revelation of the emerging new age.
The show was colorful, indeed, exuberant, but the press for all its assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny.
Lubell offers his book as an explanation of why there was no clue.
And I select this sentence as its pertinent summation : in essence the drama of his ( Eisenhower's ) Presidency can be described as the ordeal of a nation turned conservative and struggling -- thus far with but limited and precarious success -- to give effective voice and force to that conservatism.
I will assume that we are all aware of the continuing struggle, with its limited and precarious success, toward conservatism.
It has moved on various levels, it has been clamorous and confused.
Obviously there has been no agreement on what American conservatism is, or rather, what it should be.
For it was neglected, not to say nascent, when the struggle began.
I saw a piece the other day assailing William Buckley, author of Man And God at Yale and publisher of The National Review, as no conservative at all, but an old liberal.
I would agree with this view.
But I'm not here to define conservatism.
What I am here to do is to report on the gyrations of the struggle -- a struggle that amounts to self-redefinition -- to see if we can predict its future course.
One of the obvious conclusions we can make on the basis of the last election, I suppose, is that we, the majority, were dissatisfied with Eisenhower conservatism.
Though, to be sure, we gave Kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of his preferment.
This is, however, symptomatic of our national malaise.
But before I try to diagnose it, I would offer other evidence.
I will mention two volumes of specific comment on this malaise that appeared last year.
The earlier of them was an unofficial enterprise, sponsored by Life magazine, under the title of The National Purpose.
The contributors to this testament were all well-known : a former Democratic candidate for President, a New Deal poet, the magazine's chief editorial writer, two newspaper columnists, head of a national broadcasting company, a popular Protestant evangelist, etc..
What I want to point out here is that all of them are ex-liberals, or modified liberals, with perhaps one exception.
I suppose we might classify Billy Graham as an old liberal.
And I would further note that they all -- with one exception again -- sang in one key or another the same song.
Its refrain was : let us return to the individualistic democracy of our forefathers for our salvation.
Adlai Stevenson expressed some reservations about this return.
Others invoked technology and common sense.
Only Walter Lippman envisioned the possibility of our having outlived most of what we used to regard as the program of our national purposes.
But the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberals was that the one-time shibboleth of socialism was conspicuously absent.
The second specific comment was the report of Eisenhower's Commission on National Goals, titled Goals For Americans.
They, perhaps, gave the pitch of their position in the preface where it was said that Eisenhower requested that the Commission be administered by the American Assembly of Columbia University, because it was non-partisan.
The Commission seems to represent the viewpoint of what I would call the unconscious liberal, but not unconscious enough, to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism.
And here again we hear the same refrain mentioned above : the paramount goal of the United States set long ago was to guard the rights of the individual, ensure his development, enlarge his opportunity.
This group is secularist and their program tends to be technological.
But it is the need to undertake these testaments that I would submit here as symptom of the common man's malaise.
And let me add Murray's new book as another symptom of it, particularly so in view of the attention Time magazine gave it when it came out recently.
Father Murray goes back to the Declaration of Independence, too, though I may add, with considerably more historical perception.
I will reserve discussion of it for a moment, however, to return to President Kennedy.
As symptomatic of the common man's malaise, he is most significant : a liberal and a Catholic, elected by the skin of his teeth.
Does that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy, not to say confused, state of the public mind?
What is the common man's complaint?
Let's take a panoramic look back over the course we have come.
Has not that way been lit always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turning back under Eisenhower?
And the basic character of that liberalism has been spiritual rather than economic.
Ralph Gabriel gave it the name of Protestant philosophy of Progress.
But there's a subjective side to that utopian outlook.
Does our society have a runaway, uncontrollable growth of technology which may end our civilization, or a normal, healthy growth?
Here there may be an analogy with cancer : we can detect cancers by their rapidly accelerating growth, determinable only when related to the more normal rate of healthy growth.
Should the accelerating growth of technology then warn us?
Noting such evidence is the first step ; and almost the only cure is early detection and removal.
One way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of our society's organs to see if their functioning is as healthy as before.
So an objective look at our present procedures may move us to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation.
In any event, whether society may have cancer, or merely a virus infection, the disease, we shall find, is political, economical, social, and even medical.
Have not our physical abilities already deteriorated because of the more sedentary lives we are now living?
Hence the prime issue, as I see it, is whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind, or whether technology will rule and develop its own society compatible with its own needs as a force of nature.
We are already committed to establishing man's supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth, not merely in the limited social-political-economical context we are fond of today.
Otherwise, we go on endlessly trying to draw the line, color and other, as to which kind of man we wish to see dominate.
We have proved so able to solve technological problems that to contend we cannot realize a universal goal in the immediate future is to be extremely shortsighted, if nothing else.
We must believe we have the ability to affect our own destinies : otherwise why try anything?
So in these pages the term technology is used to include any and all means which could amplify, project, or augment man's control over himself and over other men.
Naturally this includes all communication forms, e.g. languages, or any social, political, economic or religious structures employed for such control.
Properly mindful of all the cultures in existence today throughout the world, we must employ these resources without war or violent revolution.
If we were creating a wholly new society, we could insist that our social, political, economic and philosophic institutions foster rather than hamper man ; best growth.
But we cannot start off with a clean slate.
So we must first analyze our present institutions with respect to the effect of each on man's major needs.
Asked which institution most needs correction, I would say the corporation as it exists in America today.
At first glance this appears strange : of all people, was not America founded by rugged individualists who established a new way of life still inspiring undeveloped societies abroad?
But hear Harrison E. Salisbury, former Moscow correspondent of The New York Times, and author of To Moscow -- And Beyond.
In a book review of The Soviet Cultural Offensive, he says, long before the State Department organized its bureaucracy into an East-*west Contacts Staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within Soviet borders, the sharp cutting-edge of American culture had carved its mark across the Russian steppes, as when the enterprising promoters of Porgy And Bess overrode the State Department to carry the contemporary cultural warfare behind the enemy lines.
They were not diplomats or jazz musicians, or even organizers of reading-rooms and photo-montage displays, but rugged capitalist entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, Hugh Cooper, Thomas Campbell, the International Harvester Co., and David W. Griffith.
Their kind created an American culture superior to any in the world, an industrial and technological culture which penetrated Russia as it did almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the Federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directives or program a series of consultations of interested agencies.
This favorable image of America in the minds of Russian men and women is still there despite years of energetic anti-*american propaganda corporations now outmoded.
Perhaps the public's present attitude toward business stems from the fact that the rugged capitalist entrepreneur no more exists in America.
In his stead is a milquetoast version known as the corporation.
But even if we cannot see the repulsive characteristics in this new image of America, foreigners can ; and our loss of prestige abroad is the direct result.
No amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid facts.
If we want respect from ourselves or others, we will have to earn it.
First, let us realize that whatever good this set-up achieved in earlier times, now the corporation per se cannot take economic leadership.
Businesses must develop as a result of the ideas, energies and ambitions of an individual having purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind.
When we forced individuals to assume the corporate structure by means of taxes and other legal statutes, we adopted what I would term pseudo-capitalism and so took a major step toward socialism.
The biggest loss, of course, was the individual's lessened desire and ability to give his services to the growth of his company and our economy.
Socialism, I grant, has a definite place in our society.
But let us not complain of the evils of capitalism by referring to a form that is not truly capitalistic.
Some forms of capitalism do indeed work -- superb organizations, a credit to any society.
But the pseudo-capitalism which dictates our whole economy as well as our politics and social life, will not stand close scrutiny.
Its pretense to operate in the public interest is little more than a sham.
It serves only its own stockholders and poorly at that.
As a creative enterprise, its abilities are primarily in swallowing creative enterprises developed outside its own organization ( an ability made possible by us, and almost mandatory ).
As to benefits to employees, it is notorious for its callous disregard except where it depends on them for services.
The corporation in America is in reality our form of socialism, vying in a sense with the other socialistic form that has emerged within governmental bureaucracy.
But while the corporation has all the disadvantages of the socialist form of organization ( so cumbersome it cannot constructively do much of anything not compatible with its need to perpetuate itself and maintain its status quo ), unluckily it does not have the desirable aspect of socialism, the motivation to operate for the benefit of society as a whole.
So we are faced with a vast network of amorphous entities perpetuating themselves in whatever manner they can, without regard to the needs of society, controlling society and forcing upon it a regime representing only the corporation's needs for survival.
The corporation has a limited, specific place in our society.
Ideally speaking, it should be allowed to operate only where the public has a great stake in the continuity of supply or services, and where the actions of a single proprietor are secondary to the needs of society.
Examples are in public utilities, making military aircraft and accessories, or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much needed project impossible to achieve by any means other than the corporate form, e.g. constructing major airports or dams.
Thus, if corporations are not to run away with us, they must become quasi-governmental institutions, subject to public control and needs.
In all other areas, private initiative of the proprietorship type should be urged to produce the desired goods and services.
Proprietorship avoiding runaway technology can be done only by assuring a humane society ; and for this human beings must be firmly in control of the economics on which our society rests.
Such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer, corporations cannot.
It can project long-range goals for itself.
Corporations react violently to short-range stimuli, e.g., quarterly and annual dividend reports.
Proprietorships can establish a unity and integrity of control ; corporations, being more amorphous, cannot.
Proprietorships can establish a meaningful identity, representing a human personality, and thus establish sincere relationships with customers and community.
Corporations are apt by nature to be impersonal, inhumane, shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated, a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public.
The proprietor is able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with its board of directors and stockholders.
Leadership is lacking in our society because it has no legitimate place to develop.
Men continuously at the head of growing enterprises can acquire experiences of the most varied, complicated and trying type so that at maturation they have developed the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely needed now.
Hence government must establish greater controls upon corporations so that their activities promote what is deemed essential to the national interest.
Proprietorships should get the tax advantages now accruing to corporations, e.g. the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth.
Corporations should pay added taxes, to be used for educational purposes ( not necessarily of the formal type ).
The right to leave legacies should be substantially reduced and ultimately eliminated.
To perpetuate wealth control led by small groups of individuals who played no role in its creation prevents those with real initiative from coming to the fore, and is basically anti-democratic.
When the proprietor dies, the establishment should become a corporation until it is either acquired by another proprietor or the government decides to drop it.
Strikes should be declared illegal against corporations because disagreements would have to be settled by government representatives acting as controllers of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be defined against proprietorship because employees and proprietors must be completely interdependent, as they are each a part of the whole.
Strikes threatening the security of the proprietorship, if internally motivated, prevent a healthy relationship.
Certainly external forces should not be applied arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so.
If we cannot stop warfare in our own economic system, how can we expect to abolish it internationally?
One kind of proprietorship these proposals would go far toward creating the economic atmosphere favoring growth of the individual, who, in turn, would help us to cope with runaway technology.
Individual human strength is needed to pit against an inhuman condition.
The battle is not easy.
We are tempted to blame others for our problems rather than look them straight in the face and realize they are of our own making and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately needed, enlightened, competent leaders.
Persons developed in today's corporations cannot hope to serve here -- a judgment based on experiences of my own in business and in activities outside.
In my own company, in effect a partnership, although legally a corporation, I have been able to do many things for my employees which normal corporations of comparable size and nature would have been unable to do.
Also, I am convinced that if my company were a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership, I would have been even abler to solve long-range problems for myself and my fellow-employees.
Any abilities I may have were achieved in their present shape from experience in sharing in the growth and control of my business, coupled with raising my family.
This combined experience, on a foundation of very average, I assure you, intelligence and background, has helped me do things many well-informed people would bet heavily against.
Perhaps a list of some of the practices of my company will help here.
The company grew out of efforts by two completely inexperienced men in their late twenties, neither having a formal education applicable to, or experience in, manufacturing or selling our type of articles.
From an initial investment of $1,200 in 1943, it has grown, with no additional capital investment, to a present value estimated by some as exceeding $10,000,000 ( we don't disclose financial figures to the public ).
Its growth continues steadily on a par with past growth ; and no limitation is in evidence.
Our pin-curl clips and self-locking nuts achieved dominance in just a few years time, despite substantial, well established competition.
During the last years of Woodrow Wilson's administration, a red scare developed in our country.
Many Americans reacted irrationally to the challenge of Russia and turned to the repression of ideas by force.
Postmaster General Burleson set about to protect the American people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mails.
Attorney General Palmer made a series of raids that sent more than 4,000 so-called radicals to the jails, in direct violation of their constitutional rights.
Then, not many years later, the Un-*american Activities Committee, under the leadership of Martin Dies, pilloried hundreds of decent, patriotic citizens.
Anyone who tried to remedy some of the most glaring defects in our form of democracy was denounced as a traitorous red whose real purpose was the destruction of our government.
This hysteria reached its height under the leadership of Senator Joseph Mc*carthy.
Demagogues of this sort found communist bogeys lurking behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyped notions.
New ideas were dangerous and must be repressed, no matter how.
Those who would suppress dangerous thoughts, credit ideas with high potency.
They give strict interpretation to William James' statement that every idea that enters the mind tends to express itself.
They seem to believe that a person will act automatically as soon as he contacts something new.
Hence, the only defensible procedure is to repress any and every notion, unless it gives evidence that it is perfectly safe.
Despite this danger, however, we are informed on every hand that ideas, not machines, are our finest tools ; they are priceless even though they cannot be recorded on a ledger page ; they are the most valuable of commodities -- and the most salable, for their demand far exceeds supply.
So all-important are ideas, we are told, that persons successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two classes : those who invent new ideas of their own, and those who borrow, beg, or steal from others.
Seemingly, with an unrestricted flow of ideas, all will be well, and we are even assured that an idea a day will keep the sheriff away.
That, however, may also bring the police, if the thinking does not meet with social approval.
Criminals, as well as model citizens, exercise their minds.
Merely having a mental image of some sort is not the all-important consideration.
Of course, there must be clarity : a single distinct impression is more valuable than many fuzzy ones.
But clarity is not enough.
The writer took a class of college students to the state hospital for the mentally ill in St. Joseph, Missouri.
An inmate, a former university professor, expounded to us, logically and clearly, that someone was pilfering his thoughts.
He appealed to us to bring his case to the attention of the authorities that justice might be done.
Despite the clarity of his presentation, his idea was not of Einsteinian calibre.
True, ideas are important, perhaps life's most precious treasures.
But have we not gone overboard in stressing their significance?
Have we not actually developed idea worship?
Ideas we must have, and we seek them everywhere.
We scour literature for them ; here we find stored the wisdom of great minds.
But are all these works worthy of consideration?
Can they stand rigid scrutiny?
Shakespeare's wit and wisdom, his profound insight into human nature, have stood the test of centuries.
But was he infallible in all things?
What of his treatment of the Jew in The Merchant Of Venice?
Shakespeare gives us a vivid picture of Shylock, but probably he never saw a Jew, unless in some of his travels.
The Jews had been banished from England in 1290 and were not permitted to return before 1655, when Shakespeare had been dead for thirty-nine years.
If any had escaped expulsion by hiding, they certainly would not frequent the market-place.
Shakespeare did not usually invent the incidents in his plays, but borrowed them from old stories, ballads, and plays, wove them together, and then breathed into them his spark of life.
Rather than from a first-hand study of Jewish people, his delineation of Shylock stems from a collection of Italian stories, Il Pecorone, published in 1558, although written almost two centuries earlier.
He could learn at second hand from books, but could not thus capture the real Jewish spirit.
Harris J. Griston, in Shaking The Dust From Shakespeare ( 216 ), writes : there is not a word spoken by Shylock which one would expect from a real Jew.
He took the story of the pound of flesh and had to fasten it on someone.
The Jew was the safest victim.
No Jew was on hand to boycott his financially struggling theater.
It would have been unwise policy, for instance, to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty Scotchman.
Just as now anyone may hurl insults at a citizen of Mars, or even of Tikopia, and no senatorial investigation will result.
Who cares about them ] Shakespeare does not tell us that Shylock was an aberrant individual.
He sets him forth as being typical of the group.
